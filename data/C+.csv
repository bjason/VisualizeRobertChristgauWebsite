FALSE,C+,Greatest Hits,Abba,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6279,"
Although four of these songs have gone top twenty here, the title commemorates the band's conquest of such places as West Germany and Costa Rica, where Abba's Europop is the biggest thing since the Beazosmonds. Americans with an attraction to vacuums, late capitalism, and satellite TV adduce Phil Spector and the Brill Building Book of Hooks in Abba's defense, but the band's real tradition is the advertising jingle, and I'm sure their disinclination to sing like Negroes reassures the Europopuli. Pervasive airplay might transform what is now a nagging annoyance into an aural totem. It might also transform it into an ashtray. God bless America, we're not likely to find out which.

FALSE,C+,Dirty Deeds Done Cheap,AC/DC,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4286,"
A 1976 Australian LP released in the wake of their ascension to the U.S. top ten, this is where those of us who weren't paying attention meet the blokelike croak of the legendary Bon Scott, asphyxiated by his own vomit shortly after Highway to Hell broke them Stateside. Now I understand why they say Brian Johnson has a great voice--he's got about about three times the range and wattage, the bloke as fantasy-fiction demigod. But those who prefer Scott's charm have a point. Like Ian Hunter or Roger Chapman though without their panache, he has fun being a dirty young man--he almost slavers through ""Ain't No Fun Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire,"" and ""Big Balls"" is fully outrageous in its class hostility. Needless to say, sexual hostility--disguised as fun, of course--is more his speed.

FALSE,C+,Blow Up Your Video,AC/DC,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4289,"
The brutal truth is that sexism has never kept a great rock-and-roller down--from Muddy to Lemmy, lots of dynamite music has objectified women in objectionable ways. But rotely is not among those ways. I mean, these guys have never known how to throw a party. Sure their costumery is good for a laugh, but Brian Johnson shrieks too much, which gets positively painful as he grows hoarse with the encroaching years, and they've always been stingy with their famous killer riffs. Their reunion with Vanda &amp; Young no more signals their renewed determination to make good albums than Elton John's reunion with Bernie Taupin. It signals commercial panic, and unlike Elton they're unlikely to reverse their downward sales path over the long haul. I eagerly await their retirement and the dynamite best-of I trust will prove subsequent upon it.

FALSE,C+,Five-a-Side,Ace,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6282,"
The single, ""How Long,"" is welcomed by some desperate souls as a breakthrough for England's pub rock movement. Bet if John David Souther lived in England he'd play pubs too. Super catchy, but even more banal than that term used as a superlative ordinarily implies, sung and played with a mildness infuriating in musicians of such skill but totally appropriate to lyricists of such underweening triviality.

It's got to be deliberate, the voice of the common man or some such. Nevertheless, making all allowances--overlooking quotes/references (""eight miles high""), universals (""the rent is due""), attempted wordplay (""a table for one and a broken heart to go""), and simple idioms (""count me in,"" ""white flag,"" ""heaven knows,"" ""it's up to you"")--I count an astonishing fifty-six full-fledged clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s""caught in the crossfire"" in the first line to ""the worst is over"" in the third-to-last. And while ""Only the Strong Survive,"" the biggest offender with twelve, streamrollers across despite it all, neither Don Henley soul nor emergent social conscience justify the dumbness density. I know the salt of the earth is the shape of things to come, but these words of wisdom are beyond the pale.

Acid house isn't stupid music; it isn't even bad music. It's music for some other species--with the Other, as always, relative to where one's Self happens to hang out. Singerless and virtually wordless, undeviating in its ""textless"" functionalism, it's impervious to consumer guidance: nobody who doesn't dance to it knows it exists, and nobody who does is gonna believe an alien like me. Nevertheless, it does exist, so say this: the best analogy isn't disco (though cf. MFSB and the Salsoul Orchestra) or dub or new age. It's fusion--beyond virtuosity, yet hopelessly in love with the almighty keyb. Though this guy isn't as weird and tricky as 808 State or A Guy Called Gerald at their fleeting best, his bottom seems suited to survival in an oxygenated environment, and once in a while he surges into something resembling life. There's the review. Now you can talk about it at parties.

Never let it be said that the youth of America can't recognize quality. These guys are spectacularly expert--with their dybbuk-or-angel vocal switchoffs, compulsive tempo shifts, dramatic dynamics, and multiple melodic and rhythmic elements, they're as exhausting to listen to as Stan Kenton, and with almost as much insight into the human heart. They predicate their worldview on their inability to win the love of Lara Croft, who led them on in a summer romance they now realize was an amoral farrago of lies and deception. So they consign her to many different hells, from ordinary suicide to my favorite: ""Watch the stars turn you to nothing."" And she thought she was so great.

""Genie in a Bottle"" was such a dazzlingly clever piece of teen self-exploration cum sexploitation that it seemed the better part of valor to hope it was a fluke. But this was avoidance--like LeAnn and unlike Britney, Christina already has ""adult"" grit and phrasing down pat, and so threatens to join Gloria, Mariah, Celine, and LeAnn herself in the endless parade of Diane Warren-fueled divas-by-fiat hitting high notes and signifying less than nothing. ""What a Girl Wants"" is clever, too, but in a far less ingratiating way--like its two-hour promotional video writ small, it raises the question of how this ruthlessly atypical young careerist can presume to advise girls not cursed with her ambition, and the fear that some of them will make her a role model regardless. Give me Left Eye any day.

The heartening sense of overall conviction here doesn't extend to many specifics, with the surprising exception of Gregg's rough yet detailed vocals.

FALSE,C+,Public Domain,Dave Alvin,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5215,"
If Harry Smith is what some people love about folk music, this is what other people hate about it, summed up by a title that claims humility as it sneaks presumption in the stage door--a title worthy of a brilliant record and dishonored by this dull one. Alvin can be a deft lyricist in the colloquial-songpoet mode, pinning the kind of homely literary detail the folk regularly established or bypassed with commonplaces, absurdities, generalizations, and luck. But it took him years to learn to sing his own stuff, and interpreting the canon he's worse than hopeless. It's not that these songs are all obvious or overdone--this nonfolkie had never heard a few of them. It's that they're so soft they squish even when Alvin tries to rev one past you, which usually he doesn't.

Will someone in the chart department tell us the last time the follow-up to a number-one album endured only eight weeks on the Billboard 200, topping out at 55? Although it's still alive on the r&amp;b list, which they can claim proves a racial militance that was never in doubt or the point, this looks like a stiff of historical proportions, more evidence that their short-term commercial success was a long-term musical fraud--limp, sententious rap feel-goodism quickly forgotten once it failed to drive the scary stuff away. Maybe in another three years, five months, and two days they'll come up with another slice of life like ""Tennessee""--or another guilt trip like ""Mr. Wendal."" But they don't have that long.

OK, two nice if slightly deliberate albums of power pop go virtually unnoticed, so you up the power, especially since you're running out of the cute tunes 'n' tricks that provide the pop. But then it isn't power pop any more--sounds almost like Angel, or Queen. Sounds pretty desperate, too.

Side one is playable, although ""God Bless the Child"" was born under a bad sign, and the hot live performances don't suit the living room as well as the more delicate studio versions available on three out of five songs. Side two, however, sounds terribly forced. Not only does John Nicholas's overstated, bloozey original make clear that Leroy Preston's songwriting is going to be missed, but his duet with Chris O'Connell is too close to Peggy Scott and Jo-Jo Benson to remain so far away. And ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" might just as well be ""Saints,"" or ""Send in the Clowns.""

These black Brits' considerable commercial success in their non-Ethiopian homeland guarantees no more than any other band's commercial success; though they're avowedly more roots, their songs for lovers (""Your Recipe"") and rhythmic extensions (""Soca Rumba"") are as serviceably undistinguished as those of Third World, a commercially successful band indeed. And I'm sure they could have made their U.S. introductions more winningly than with a year's dub album followed by a live job. Inspirational Intro: ""You know what live and direct mean? It mean live and direct.""

A rather ordinary-sounding white Southern boogie band, except that this one has its roots in pop--they began as the Candymen, the greatest cover band in history. Only they actually began as Roy Orbison's backup band. As you might imagine, they're tighter and slicker than your ordinary boogie band, which all things considered is a small boon. I hope somebody on Capricorn covers ""Wrong."" And I hope they find something as good as, oh, ""Good Vibrations"" to cover themselves.

For H.R. this precedent-setting band has devolved into a money gig--he feels more comfortable juicing his Afro-universalist utterances with the reggae-inflected world-rock of his solo records and his alternate group Human Rights. And though the title tune claims to jam the disco with acid rock and hardcore rather than hip hop/go go/bebop, the shit sure sounds like metal to me. Sure sounds like Dr. Know, too--on his own H.R. is only a bore, but in this context his male chauvinist arrogance comes through loud if not clear.

Where five years ago Baker was a soul singer who honored the traditional soul audience's lounge leanings, now she's an arena-lounge singer manufacturing generalized intimacy for 26-to-45s. Rid of funky minor-label producer-songwriter Patrick Moten, she composed two tracks for Rapture and worked on a third. Here she's down to two collaborations as the credits edge toward El Lay--if Britten-Lyle and the Perris have anted up, can Carole Bayer Sager and Toto be far behind? She's not a total loss yet--despite the universal lyrics and inflated choruses, three tracks make something of her established standards.

I admit to a weakness for Shel Silverstein, who wrote all fourteen songs on this record--or rather, these two records, as this is Nashville's first country oratorio or something (subject: America or something). But even for a fan, Silverstein's jokes and tugs on the heartstrings wear thin after half an hour (if not ten minutes). Nor does the audience of cronies yukking it up and singing along do much for Bare's interpretations, which verge on the obvious under the best of circumstances.

In case you were wondering what Bill Graham's been up to, here he is directing the career of a Nashville veteran with a great ear who's never fulfilled his great expectations. His CBS debut, Bare, was a Shel Silverstein collaboration that offered its fair share of pleasures, but it didn't sell, so this one goes rock-schlock, befouling good songs with strings that aren't up to Parton and Byrdsy cadences that aren't up to McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman. Fortunately, the new one hasn't sold either.

She's got a fine little instrument, like a nubile Bonnie Bramlett--the drawl pure cracker, the pitch and rhythm deep blue. But what she's selling with it is tractability.

Not so terrible, I caught myself thinking first time I played these imaginary soundtracks, and they're not--not by the standard of the early-'50s radio mush preserved on the companion Baxter's Best (""Unchained Melody,"" ""I Love Paris,"" oy). Here, selections from Ritual of the Savage and its many successors exploit mallet instruments with some verve and tickle those nostalgic for their grandparents' fantasies of benign imperialism. But even in the same dubious vein, Esquivel has more razzmatazz and Martin Denny is crucially sparer. The strings and occasional brass are de trop enough--if you can abide the choruses doo-dooing and ahh-ahhing away, start monitoring your insulin levels.

Rollermania in this country was pretty depressing--1977's ""You Made Me Believe in Magic,"" the last of their three top-tenners, could have been by Bread or Barry Manilow, and better the Partridge Family than that. Still, they got to put their name on three great singles, more than most people who make albums (or singles) manage: the number-one breakthrough ""Saturday Night,"" the semistiff ""Rock and Roll Love Letter,"" and the completely stiff ""Yesterday's Heroes,"" a 1976 song about how they had to take command or fade away that was written for them--at their command, I'm sure--by Vanda &amp; Young.

They can't have much faith in the new one if they're loss-leading with an old one (the one that turned them into a cult band, now finally--how did we stand the wait?--available in its pristine mono form). And indeed, there's no reason they should. Despite the title, it's not some sort of primitive surf doowop--sounds a lot like Friends and Holland to me. Fairly pleasant, but even the highlights aren't all that hot: a nice Brian Wilson oeuvre called ""Marcella"" (sounds like Smiley Smile) and a silly gospel song for the Maharishi.

The Brit version made sense, because lots of Beatle songs are unavailable on U.K. LP. In the U.S. the group's been cannibalized more efficiently--not counting the curious two-second Sgt. Pepper outgroove, only five of fourteen songs here are unknown to owners of their Capitol albums catalogue. Two early Lennon-McCartneys, the assured close-harmony ""Misery"" and the fragile quavery ""There's a Place,"" are very much worth your acquaintance. ""Sie Liebt Dich"" is fun, ""You Know My Name (Look Up My Number)"" is a goof, and ""The Inner Light"" is a B side--George's B side. Except for ""Across the Universe,"" which Phil Spector did not improve, not one of the nine alternate versions differs from the original by more than a whit. The U.K. Please Please Me includes ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place."" I regard it as a superior investment.

But stick this follow-up in the changer and the magic of compression raises the volume of these transparently calculated songs to barrage level. Even doing her humble bit, she yells in your ear. So what's all this about how she just lost her job but has so many reasons to be happy anyway--and so do you, girlie! Though the Sean Kingston collab generated sales and remixes and the album hung around in the top 40, it's yet to go gold. I never rejoice about the death of the record business.

Banned from South Africa himself, Belafonte sent arranger Richard Cummings and lyricist Jake Holmes in to lay down tracks with Makgona Tsohle, Brenda Fassie, even the Soul Brothers (who turned Simon down), and both representatives made a mess with the boss's full approval--Makgona Tsohle play cream cheese, the Zulu word for power turns into a woman's name, and the interracial love duet with Jennifer Warnes is no less saccharine for being punishable by death. Yet the Obed Ngobeni-backed title song is a triumph--a tremendously hot piece of assimilationist mbaqanga that conveys apartheid's insanity and mbaqanga's joy-pain in English ironic enough to get past the SABC.

From showbiz ""hard rock"" (""Heartbreaker"") to big-beat ""cabaret"" (""Don't Let It Show"") to received ""futurism"" (""My Clone Sleeps Alone"") to fake-Blondie ""Eurodisco"" (""We Live for Love""), she shows about as much aesthetic principle as Don Kirshner. Though she does have a better voice than Kirshner.

FALSE,C+,In Flight,George Benson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6388,"
Upon reflection, it seems to me that what Benson does these days isn't a sellout but an apotheosis--this kind of palaver has been the soul of jazz guitar since the '50s. Turn those amps up! Let's hear some distortion!
"
FALSE,C+,Pleasure Victim,Berlin,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8212,"
Although my tastes in porn don't run to designer whips, Terri Nunn's sex-object impersonation on the cunningly entitled ""Sex (I'm a . . .)"" generates a mild buzz. But that's the only good part--the rest is flimsy synth-pop sans even a flash of pink, unless songs about the Metro make you wet your pants.
"
FALSE,C+,I'm Your Woman,Sandra Bernhard,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8213,"
Marianne Faithfull's survivor and Grace Jones's dominatrix both went up against Barry Reynolds's austere mechanics from strength, and better men wrote their best songs--John Lennon, Iggy Pop, Shel Silverstein, Melvin Van Peebles. The music here is Reynolds's ballgame, and if Bernhard's compulsively slippery irony is strength, I'm a great artist. I assume she gets to certain under-30 women because they find the twin escapes of dominance and submission wickedly seductive, and trust they're far enough from her fantasy star-world to take her as a metaphor for what's most oppressed and/or neurotic in themselves. I assume guys think she's more fun than reading the personals.

FALSE,C+,Music: The Best of the Beta Band,The Beta Band,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13105,"
Rock-ambient Brits, you remember. Four albums, 1998-2004. First one actually three EPs. Can't remember how I was convinced to enjoy the second--has some tunes, my notes say, and I try to be kind. Young alt fans do get weary, so their third and fourth suffered disregard, and the Betas broke up in despair, dismay, or a snit. Where those tunes might be hiding on this prematurely useless 16-song best-of I don't have the heart to figure out. Why nine of the 16 are repeated on the 13-song farewell concert that inflates the package's price only their accountant knows for sure. Kindness can be such a waste of time.

FALSE,C+,Megatop Phoenix,Big Audio Dynamite,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4387,"
Forward-looking of Mick to devote himself to interracial rock-the-house. But strip away the samples and give the lyrics the respect they deserve and you're left with a mild voice over beats so dinky only college radio could dance to them. Plus a sweet pop song that isn't called ""Feelings"" because that title's taken.
"
FALSE,C+,Slam,Big Dipper,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5838,"
Marginally more lyrical on Epic than on Homestead (less like the Embarrassment, which I take as evolution rather than compromise), their one great new postpunk moment is called ""Monsters of Jazz"" (about music, natch). They exemplify Amerindie's throw-it-up-against-the-wall phase--modestly talented bands granted their arbitrary shot, stiffing, and diluting the credibility and capital available to inspired music. No tragedy, because it isn't important enough. Just sad.

FALSE,C+,Hometown Boy Makes Good,Elvin Bishop,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1147,"
Elvin sounds like he's on automatic, Mickey Thomas sounds like he wants to be a rock and roll star, and this album sounds like it might fly apart if you were to spin it at forty-five by mistake. It's still fun, I guess. But not enough fun.
"
FALSE,C+,Careless,Stephen Bishop,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6404,"
Bishop ain't bad for a pop singer-songwriter--his voice is three-quarters Simon and one-quarter Garfunkel and he's got as much brains as and fewer pretensions than either. He commits no sins. Omits quite a few, though--even boasts that he's outgrown material like ""I Feel So Miserable Without You, It's Almost Like Having You Here.""
"
FALSE,C+,Post,Bjï¿½ï,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6241,"
This well-regarded little item rekindles my primeval suspicion of Europeans who presume to ""improve"" on rock and roll (or for that matter Betty Hutton, originator of the best song here). I don't miss the Sugarcubes' guitars per se so much as their commitment to the groove, which--sporadic though it would remain, Iceland not being one of your blues hotbeds--might shore up the limited but real intrinsic interest of her eccentric instrumentation, electronic timbres, etc. Then there's her, how shall I say it, self-involved vocal devices. Which brings us to, right, her lyrics, which might hit home harder if she'd grown up speaking the English she'll die singing, but probably wouldn't. Anybody out there remember Dagmar Krause? German, Henry Cow, into artsong and proud of it? Well, take my word for it. She was no great shakes either. But at least she had politics.

Two years ago, when they were licking broken cymbals and mixing in keyb groans from a reel-to-reel, I told my diary they reminded me of the Swans and were as likely to go classical. So who've they been listening to? Somebody tinklier than I would have figured. Elliott Carter? Stockhausen to lay some arid accessibility on your ass? ""Original"" of them if so, they are that. Novelty records--rock and rollers can never get enough of them.

FALSE,C+,Slip It In,Black Flag,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4402,"
""Slip It In"" is by somebody who learned about sex from movies. ""Black Coffee"" carries this antidrug thing too far. ""Wound Up"" could be tighter. ""Rat's Eyes"" cries out in agony for Sabbath's chops. ""Obliteration"" is an ace accompanist's solo turn. ""The Bars"" isn't about prison--or saloons. ""My Ghetto"" is an outtake from the rant side of Damaged. ""You're Not Evil"" is right on.

FALSE,C+,Blind Melon,Blind Melon,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5805,"
The biggest assholes yet to go alternative platinum share management with Guns 'N Roses and woodshedded in El Lay before moving to North Carolina to research their image. Musically they're kind of a cross between Rhinoceros and Savage Resurrection, although without the steamroller drive of the former or the messy idealism of the latter. They do boast better chops, however. A quarter-century down the line, that's what bizzers call progress--chops, and MTV.

FALSE,C+,Natural High,Bloodstone,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6420,"
Any album that includes both a hit soul-harmony ballad and ""Bo Diddley"" (the band's from England, natch) deserves a second listen. But believe me, the tenth is a dubious investment.

FALSE,C+,I Wanna Be a Lifeguard,Blotto,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4418,"
One of indie rock's greatest failures stories, they burst upon us in 1980 with the title tune, a novelty number at least as hilarious as ""Snoopy vs. the Red Baron"" (which couldn't have cracked commercial radio in the boring commercial '80s either, I bet). Here they compile a best-of from their DIY EPs/LPs for a slightly larger DIY concern--they would have been happy to sign with a major, but not for shit money, no sir. In among the mildly amusing and hopelessly unfunny you'll find the definitive top-40 bar-band parody ""(We Are) The Nowtones."" The metal parody they don't have the chops for.
"
FALSE,C+,Blue Angel,Blue Angel,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4424,"
There's a lyric sheet for some reason, and God knows the colorized cover cultivates a look, but the selling point of this uptown power pop is Cyndi Lauper's cute, zaftig voice--the songs all feature little toon-tricks designed to show off its swoops and swells. Try the band feature, a '50s cover that goes ""Wo, wo, cut out,"" and the autobiographical '50s tribute, ""Late.""
"
FALSE,C+,The Magic of the Blue,Blue Magic,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6426,"
I've never been able to go all the way with groups that specialize in repressed-backbeat falsetto ballads. The few I've liked--only the Chi-Lites and the Stylistics for more than one song at a time--barely redeemed their simpiness by sounding sincere, or do I mean dumb, and in the wake of an inspired debut these hotshots just don't. Instant professionalism, I guess, combined with the usual song fatigue. Recommended only to those who want to know what the Stylistics will sound like after Russell Thompkins gets his B.A. and learns to sing like a sane, responsible adult.
"
FALSE,C+,On Your Feet or on Your Knees,Blue Oyster Cult,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6428,"
This live double, proof that they've earned the right to issue cheapo product, is a fitting testament. The packaging makes their ominoso joke more explicit than it's ever been, and if the music is humdrum more often than searing, maybe that means these closet intellectuals have finally achieved the transubstantiation of their most baroque fantasies.
"
FALSE,C+,Briefcase Full of Blues,Blues Brothers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6432,"
The studio-superstar backup band isn't exactly long on personality, but it rocks, and almost every song ranks as an underrecorded classic. John Belushi goes out of his way--earnestly, even awkwardly--to identify the original artists, which cancels out the Rasta jokes on ""Groove Me."" However. If Belushi told those jokes to supply his fans with their ration of dope humor, then shame on him. But if he was just nervous about treading in the voiceprints of Junior Wells and King Floyd, he had reason--he's not as convincing as most white blues singers, much less Junior Wells or King Floyd. Is this a top-ten album because people actually want to listen to it? Inspirational Patter: ""I'd suggest you buy as many blues albums as you can.""
"
FALSE,C+,Open,Blues Image,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6433,"
I love ""Ride Captain Ride,"" really. But the only mystery ship that transports anyone from the San Francisco Bay to Parchman Farm is rock and roll--rock and roll more inspired than this.
"
FALSE,C+,Dedication,Gary U.S. Bonds,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4429,"
This is impressive and good-hearted. Not only did B. Springsteen get a record deal for the rock and roller whose oldies have been topping B.'s show since whenever, he got him a hit. Featuring the voice of none other than B. Springsteen, who comes more naturally to these impressive, good-hearted, new B. Springsteen songs (as well as the Dylan and Browne and Lennon-McCartney oldies) than the rock and roller. For one thing, B. has more soul.
"
FALSE,C+,"For Emma, Forever Ago",Bon Iver,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14260,"
Re-accessing Robert Creeley gave me a grip on these solitary meditations, which lose definition faster than an angel's breath on a January morn. Beloved by sensitive young men like Justin Vernon, who recorded the album one winter in his father's Wisconsin hunting cabin after breaking up with his band and his girlfriend in North Carolina, the lyrics aren't as lax as one might fear--as in Creeley, the lines are short and the diction is spare. But the turns of phrase are usually cul-de-sacs, the flights into obscurity have bum wings, and do you really prefer, for instance, Vernon's best-in-show ""Now all your love is wasted?/Then who the hell was I?"" (much less ""Only love is all maroon/Lapping lakes like leery loons"") to this Creeley ordinaire: ""Soon everything will be sold/and I can go back home/by myself again/and try to be a man""? Yea, sigh his admirers sensitively, in musical context, you old cynic. His falsetto, his murmurs, his accompaniment--they're all so lonely, as when he introduces the climactic ""Re: Stacks"" with a doleful 45-second guitar strum. To which I can only compare Ralph Carney's grooveful, multifaceted 45-second intro to ""The Invoice,"" which in its subsequent minute says more about our shared aloneness than Vernon's whole record.
"
FALSE,C+,New Jersey,Bon Jovi,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4433,"
I see three ways to take the transparently pseudo Springsteenian sincerity of Jon's bid to improve his artistic reputation and his platinum multiple at the same time. You could lie back and enjoy its giant hooks, identifying with the masses all the while. You could cheer its de facto deconstruction of rock ""authenticity."" Or you could blow lunch. As someone who learned to love ""Livin' on a Prayer"" in heavy rotation at a swimming pool, I reserve the right to choose option one upon suitable stimulus from somebody else's radio. Now pass the bucket.
"
FALSE,C+,Have a Nice Day,Bon Jovi,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13059,"
Bon Jovi mean so little long or short term that it was only with this redolently entitled cheese bomb that I realized they hadn't actually broken up back in the fabled '90s. (Really--I took all their '00s albums for reunion one-shots, and couldn't figure out why the product kept coming in the three seconds I thought about it.) The commercial secret is as unchanging as Jon-Jon's mysteriously unwrinkled countenance--hard rock so inoffensive it's less Aerosmith than Air Supply. Not only is it impossible to tell whether the one called ""Bells of Freedom"" is pro- or anti-Bush, it's impossible to tell whether it's patriotic. A depressing argument for the existence of that intellectual fairy tale, the passive mass audience.

FALSE,C+,This Boot Is Made for Fonk-n.,Bootsy's Rubber Band,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=421,"
Bootsy sounds like a kiddie-show host at the end of his tether--trotting out sound effects, Steve Martin imitations, desperate appeals to DJs, anything he can think of. Except a good riff.

FALSE,C+,Diamond Dogs,David Bowie,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=956,"
In which a man who has always turned his genuine if unendearing talent for image manipulation to the service of his dubious literary and theatrical gifts evolves from harmless kitsch into pernicious sensationalism. Despite two good songs and some thoughtful (if unhummable) rock sonorities, this is doomsday purveyed from a pleasure dome. Message: eat, snort, and be pervy, for tomorrow we shall be peoploids--but tonight how about buying this piece of plastic? Say nay.
"
FALSE,C+,Never Let Me Down,David Bowie,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4440,"
Maybe he's lost touch so completely that he's reduced to cannibalizing himself just when the market dictates the most drastic image shift of his chameleon career. But maybe this is just his way of melding two au courant concepts, Springsteenian rock and multiproducer crossover. After all, why pay good money to outsiders when your own trunk of disguises is there for the rummaging? Of course, crossover artistes can generally sing. When Bowie wants to play the vocalist, he still puts on a bad Anthony Newley imitation.
"
FALSE,C+,Heathen,David Bowie,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11554,"
The ""Bowie's back"" huzzahs that accompany every one of this music mill's new releases beg the question of what he's back to and from. The reason Englishmen have actually touted him as the greatest rock artiste of all time is that he's the least American major rock artiste of all time, which is one reason his careful brand maintenance isn't filling any arenas over here. Just to be mean I compared his latest phoenix imitation to 1979's Lodger, a certified nonclassic I always kind of liked. Lodger won easy. He has indeed Learned to Sing, thus rendering himself more the chansonnier only art-rockers ever wanted him to be, and the strain is hell on his sense of humor. The textures are nicer now, but whose aren't? And while the songwriting ain't bad, it also ain't that good. Just switch between the Black Francis cover and any other track and you'll know exactly what I mean.

Mike Chapman adds few if any hooks and Annabella Lwin shockingly little verve to their pattering Afrobeats. None of Malcolm McLaren's pubescent sex fantasies was half as dumb or exploitative as ""Aphrodisiac."" And though I'm glad they're expressing themselves, only the glorious ""Rikki Dee"" (""I work at the WC"") tells me any teenage news I hadn't guessed.

Touted by the Dandy Warhols in the impressive Dig, Anton Newcombe gets a no doubt small, no doubt excessive cash advance to prove his genius with 38 songs the world passed on the first time. The world was right, and will be right again every time Newcombe revives. His recombined riffs rarely break the shambolic surface, and whenever two consecutive lines of lyric grab and hold, they complain. The Dandy Warhols' drones have some pull to them, their hooks some sock. They're funny, too. They overrate Newcombe because they do with panache and professionalism what he does with heroin and lies, and feel guilty about it.

FALSE,C+,The Age of Consent,Bronski Beat,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4460,"
Good politics don't have to be this monochromatic, and neither do albums with two good singles on them. Problem's pretty simple--the narrow dynamic range that afflicts so many falsettos, even those with impeccable reasons for singing like women. And before you call me persnickety, swear you wouldn't rather hear Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love.""
"
FALSE,C+,Right On Time,The Brothers Johnson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6461,"
I once tagged Earth, Wind &amp; Fire as black MOR, but these guys straightened out my categories. EW&amp;F is more like Elton John or early Supremes--formularized music worked out with undeniable verve. This is more in the area of Foreigner or Firefall--pop professionalism reduced to a concept in which all annoyances and other signs of life are eliminated. Funk is often automatic, but it must take some heavy discipline to make it bland.

FALSE,C+,Alright Again!,Clarence Gatemouth Brown,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=611,"
Texans, Jesus--give them a black man in a cowboy hat and they won't stop jawing about the wide open spaces until they fall off the barstool. And what is this thing they have for blues brass in platoons? I mean, Bobby Bland can sing over, under, and around that shit, but this old pro obviously hasn't bulled his way past a tenor sax in twenty years. Still packs a fairly sharp guitar, I grant you, and he can make you listen up with that violin of his. But he's fronting some very unswinging white boys, and his idea of contemporary is the stock-market woes of small businessmen.

FALSE,C+,Sho Is Funky Down Here,James Brown,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6465,"
Brown's farewell to his own indie label is so outre purists will probably prize it. Rock-funk instrumentals dominated by (literally) anonymous electric piano and guitar, both more rock than funk, which would never be said of the rhythm section. At moments it sounds like JB Meets BB--and I don't mean the bluesman, I mean Bela Bartok--in the person of arranger Dave Matthews. As for JB, he grunts a few times. Veddy interesting.

If Someone were to airlift this one tape to you in the tundra, the remakes would be godsends. But if you own another version of ""Sex Machine"" you own a better one. Ditto ""I Feel Good,"" ditto every aimless solo, and ditto the reading from Rand-McNally.

FALSE,C+,People,James Brown,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4462,"
Anybody who thinks his first Brad Shapiro album was mechanical should get a load of what a real assembly line sounds like. Original Disco Man was a labor of vanity, and when it didn't hype his career the way he'd been told it would JB went back on automatic. Shapiro &amp; Co. respond in kind.
"
FALSE,C+,Gravity,James Brown,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4466,"
Not a James Brown album--a James Brown-influenced Dan Hartman record, with James Brown on vocals. Unlike Brad Shapiro, who manufactured good music this way in 1979, Hartman takes his humdrum copyrights and urges the great one to go for the expressiveness he hasn't commanded in over a decade rather than the rhythm he'll take to his grave. Don't believe me--just compare any of Polydor's most recent compilations: James Brown's Funky People (featuring Lyn Collins, Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, and James Brown), Dead on the Heavy Funk 74-76 (salvaging a total of zero good LPs), or In the Jungle Groove (long-promised, worth-waiting for, full-length, '69-'71 dance classics). Hartman would love every one.

Never hep to his jive, I'm less than shocked by the generalized sentimentality disillusioned admirers descry within these hallowed tracks, though the one about the late great Lowell George (think it's him, any other El Lay rocker die recently?) is unusually rank. I grant that the sincere vocals and rising organ chords do make my heart swell in spite of itself once in a while. But I wonder whether the lost kids (i.e., Lost Kids) in ""Boulevard"" wear mohawks, and whether JB will ever find it in himself to sing to them. Inspirational Line: ""That girl was sane.""

A satire on, celebration of, and lament for the upper-middle classmates an Orange County liberal knows like he knows his neighbor's backyard, the title song is a coup: poignant, droll, political about his own experience rather than some victim's. And dat's dat. Anticlimax: the yearningly Springsteenian--get this title--""For a Rocker.""

Contrary to rumor, this is not an Unjustly Ignored Work of Art. This is a Bad Work of Art. Bruce's music is, yes, well-made, dense and dissonant and throbbing (no one else in rock plays so much bass). But it's designed to support Pete Brown's lyrics, which are, arghh, overwrought, obscure and literary and clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½""I trace your name in spinach""). I know, Brown has been disfiguring Bruce's work since Cream. But at least then he lightened up occasionally. And at least then his bad lyrics functioned mostly as vocal color for the instrumental interaction, whereas here they're enunciated in Bruce's forced art-song style and printed on a special page of the jacket.

Long before Brian Eno hyped ambient, there was the less pretentious term background music, and you can be sure our brave new age will goop up the margin between the two. At his most austere, Eno's old buddy Budd is hyperromantic, and this isn't exactly austere--with the proper inducements (hypnosis, or a large bribe), he might even call it a sellout. Weak-mindedness passing itself off as spirituality--it's what new agers seek in classical music. Budd's angle is to eliminate any vestige of difficulty from the concept.

Burnett is like the Band without self-consciousness--his vocal anguish is really moral, with a sense of history. When he opens with ""We Have All Got a Past"" he's only trying to talk someone into bed, but boy, does that title resonate.

It isn't all as archly mawkish as the rearranged dreamsongs from his group's worst album. Pretentiously dinky is more the prevailing mood--a soundtrack only, like so many arty soundtracks before it. One where Byrne, Meredith Monk, the Kronos Quartet, and some locals who couldn't have known what they were getting into do for Texas what Byrne &amp; Eno did for Africa.
"
FALSE,C+,Rei Momo,David Byrne,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=966,"
Byrne respects and understands distance, an essential faculty in world-beat projects, and his increasingly sinuous singing should make this Latin synthesis a natural. The lyrics are explicitly social without sacrificing the nervous literacy of his established voice. He picks good musicians and provides proper arrangements. And the result is a respectful, highly intelligent dud. Irritating though the muscular masculinity of sonero tradition may be, any doubts as to why it's there are dispelled by Byrne's inability to wrap his weedy chops around salsa that's too tasteful by half. And I'm beginning to suspect he writes rock lyrics--words that can only impact loud, grating, and straight-ahead.

FALSE,C+,Grown Backwards,David Byrne,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12343,"
The two opera selections signify one thing, and it's not that those voice lessons have finally paid off. It's that more even than Randy Newman or Tom Waits (or Sting), this likable Manhattan progressive conceives himself as a performer of artsongs. As a writer of same he has his moments. Somebody somewhere could do justice to the absurdly abject ""Glad"" or the smarmily rationalized ""Empire"" or ""She Only Sleeps,"" the love tribute of a sex worker's boyfriend. Byrne cannot. His voice devoid of Newman-Waits grit, his eclecticism even and controlled where theirs bristles with jokes, oddity, and gusto, how does he expect to connect with anyone but other likable progressives, and rather detached and inscrutable ones at that? The guy's been championing the ordinary since More Songs About Buildings and Food. But he makes such a point of approaching it from the outside you have to wonder whether as far as he's concerned that isn't just more exoticism, which for him is the only thing that comes naturally.

If you have any doubts about needing this handsome $94-list package, you don't. If you're moved to ask pop-friendly me, you don't. Every CD box is larded with marginalia, but the good folks at Revenant--who last year reckoned Charlie Feathers cut 42 ""essential"" tracks between 1954 and 1969--live for it. They believe consumers should share the thrill of digging through the crates, palpitating as the voice of genius emanates from a dusty reel of tape. So instead of winnowing out an hour or so of lost songs, jelled jams, and unjust outtakes, they throw in a 13-minute CD of dim studio chatter, a minute of Don Van Vliet playing the harmonica over the telephone, etc. Take it from pop-friendly me--if you've spent more time with the Captain's free sessions than with Ornette Coleman's, you need to get your priorities in order.

Chapman's voice is even sexier than her looks, she boasts the uncompromising macho ambition of the fanatic rock and roller, and her album is graced with the subtle touches that make fanatic rock and roll come alive. Yet oddly enough it lacks momentum--which I blame not only on producer Al Kooper but on a workaday band and on Chapman's own lingering role confusion. Not one cut sustains. The Bob Seger cover never rocks out, the Hank Williams tribute gets echoed to death, ""I Walk the Line"" is an elegant false start, and the I-was-born-to-rock-and-roll soliloquy is one of the slow songs--as are too many of the others.

So I ask myself: what could be more vulgar than the 20-minute ""Hair Anthology Suite"" that occupies one side of this lp? The answer is nothing, but somehow the old verve is lacking. Spector always excelled at singles, not albums, and that's part of the problem. But it's more than that. Except for the great ""Black Pearl,"" this is too ornate rhythmically, and in this age of super-production the instrumentation doesn't communicate the old outrageousness. Too bad about Phil.

Though a few mediocrities are eliminated and there's a vague chronological rationale (start with the pop stuff kinda and then backtrack kinda), this two-disc repackage could have been programmed by a random-play button.

Having never cracked the r&amp;b top twenty, he made one half decent album for Hi in 1973, and his broad delivery has gained no discernible acuity since. In short, he's a journeyman, and no matter what adoring Japanese innocents think, he's dull and overstated both. I know he's got Hi Rhythm behind him, but would you buy an Eddie Floyd album for Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s--especially with Teenie Hodges taking an endless organ solo?

Seekers after a reggae triumvirate insist that this album is an improvement, which is stretching the truth--the singing's a shade tougher, the writing's a shade sharper, and there are two relatively striking tracks, both of which detail Cliff's paranoia.

In which Cliff rerecords all the great songs he cut originally for Island and A&amp;M--that is, all the great songs he's written, about six total--at a new royalty rate. Always a passionately soulful live performer, he puts a lot into them, but the exigencies of in-concert arrangement take more out, and only ""Viet Nam,"" with its litany of war-torn Third World countries, offers anything radically new. Also new are a cover of Cat Stevens's ""Wild World,"" a singalong movie theme, and a brief sermon about the universal language.

He never gives up, and he never learns from his mistakes, exemplified by the stupefying professionalism with which his authentic JA band negotiates the U.S. pop-funk beats and changes on side one.

Harold Budd records in their studio. The Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir records on their label. I understand that they're more foolish than either (not naive, not after six years), and that they've been known to milk momentary momentum out of electric guitars, but the affinities are there--these faeries are in the aura business. So what are they doing on the alternative rock charts? Ever hear the one about being so open-minded that when you lay down to sleep your brains fall out?

Cohn sings like a sentimental Warren Zevon--an exclusively sentimental Warren Zevon, I mean. He's got some tunes.

I believe good singers (which Cole is) ought to sing good songs.

Before anyone knew she'd go platinum, netcrit Glenn McDonald presciently declared Cole the new queenpin of a female tradition he traced from Kate Bush through Peter Gabriel, Melissa Etheridge, and Sarah McLachlan. Although McDonald sanely declared this genre the obverse of male-identified metal, a skeptic with no tolerance for subpeaks in either would like to note that each is beholden to ""classical"" precepts of musical dexterity and genitalia-to-the-wall expression.

Already a veteran of three bands that meant a great deal to their tiny complement of fans and bubkes to everyone else (Dangerous Birds, Uzi, and Live Skull--how could you forget?), Thalia Zedek is now an established cult heroine. Read her notices and you'll learn that Come is both her song move and her blues move; listen to the music and you'll notice a few flatly projected melodies and some slide guitar. Since her lyrics range from unintelligible to incomprehensible and a groove would be too kind, we're left with a sound--the raw stylization of one woman's alienation. Those who happen to have been captivated by her ""dark,"" ""androgynous"" live shtick can read into this alienation what they will--most likely some parallel to or complement of their own, which is most likely different.

Despite sage advice from my female advisers, I cherished hopes that Coolidge's thick voice--which is grainy rather than gritty, like the Bramlett voice without the bravura--would grow on me the way Tracy Nelson's did. She does get more out of ""Seven Bridges Road"" than Tracy does by underplaying the overstatement just a little, and it's nice to hear ""The Happy Song"" as praise for a househusband.

Jazz-rock goes progressive, by which I mean cool, man. Coryell is himself, by which I mean a chameleon. But Steve Marcus sticks strictly to soprano, and Mike Mandel makes like he doesn't want anybody to know he once played piano in a (shh) rock band.

Too often his pessimism sounds like not just bitterness but spite. He didn't take over the world, and is he mad--not only can't he make the personal political, he can't even make it popular. The Mitchell Froom-produced arrangements here are stuck between Tom Waits as Kurt Weill and Tom Waits as Jackson Browne--Randy Newman is beyond them. So as performed, the good songs are overblown tragedies, the bad ones overblown trifles. The best is the simplest because it's the simplest--""Playboy to a Man,"" love to hear John Hiatt rockabilly it. The most tragic is the chiliastic ""Other Side of Summer,"" recommended to punk bands in the market for a song with a lot of words in it. And I admit ""Invasion Hit Parade"" almost makes the spiteful political. Its theory of life is that fascism has a great deal in common with songs you don't like on the radio.

Tragically but also irritatingly, Dolores O'Riordan indulges all the vices people too stupid for Woody Guthrie or Linton Kwesi Johnson say politics bring out in music: she's strident, moralistic, simple-minded, full of herself. Not only is she shocked to discover that wars are caused by, I would never have guessed, ""political pride"" and ""territorial greed,"" but she thinks she's a better person for telling Tchaikovsky the news.

Clapton, Bruce, and Baker made their money (and names) and ruined their music (and fellowship) in concert. About forty percent of what they released on record during their career was live, so this posthumous product is unnecessary by definition; it's also preferable to the live disc of Wheels of Fire (""Toad"" and ""Spoonful"" are their nadir), if not to the more shapely live cuts on Goodbye. The intensity of side one is unmistakable and attractive, but I'll take Clapton's graceful picking on Fresh Cream's ""Sleepy Time Time"" over the flat-out distortions here--Hendrix has all that amp stuff locked up solid.

Forget the careerist compromise, dazed ennui, and soggy despair, and take this hustle for what it pretends to be and at some level is: four diehard hippies expressing themselves. Poor old guys can't leave politics alone--there's more ecology and militarism here than when they were figureheads of pop revolution, and though the rhetoric is predictable, the impulse has a woozy nobility. Not that that's ever been reason to pay Graham's ditties any mind, or that Stephen's steady-state egotism is redeemed by stray references to judges and changing the world. But while David's cocaine confessional makes ""Almost Cut My Hair"" seem self-abnegating, his ""Nighttime for the Generals"" sure beats Sting. And Neil lends musical muscle and gets commercial muscle back. So, not as horrible as you expected--nor good enough to give a third thought.

No dolt, she figures it's in her best interest to sound like one--as well as an insider outsider like Gush and Bore, whose horrible lessons in playing it safe she takes to heart. ""We got rockstars in the Whitehouse/All our popstars look like porn,"" she whines on the first track, which the ""hit"" tops by claiming, ""I don't have diddly squat,"" while dissing her ""friend the communist"" (who I bet isn't, and I also bet doesn't deserve the putdown). And those are the good songs. Soon here come Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, turns of phrase like ""Lay it like it plays [a little dumb, but OK]/Play it like it lays [wha?]"" and ""With broken wings we'll learn to fly"" and (am I missing some irony here?) ""Life is what happens when you're making plans."" Over this I'd take not the White House (where she'd go in a second if invited politely) but certainly porn (which I note without prejudice she is).

Art-pop is like the dB's and XTC, when a fascination with craft spirals up and in until it turns into an aestheticist obsession. Split Enz was an art-rock band gone pop--sillier, crasser, more full of itself--and Neil Finn's California-based trio dispenses only with the silly. Hooks you can buy anywhere these days, and for directness you might as well apply straight to Bruce Hornsby--beyond the occasional hint of guitar anarchy, this is product for sure.

With the transmutation of junk a species of junk itself, an evasion available to any charlatan or nincompoop, it's tempting to ignore this patent arena move altogether. But by pumping his bad faith and bad relationship into depressing moderato play-loud keyb anthems far more tedious than his endless vamps, Robert Smith does actually confront a life contradiction. Not the splintered relationship, needless to say, although the title tune is a suitably grotesque breakup song among unsuitably grotesque breakup songs. As with so many stars, even ""private"" ones who make a big deal of their ""integrity,"" Smith's demon lover is his audience, now somehow swollen well beyond his ability to comprehend, much less control. Hence the huge scale of these gothic cliches. And watch out, you mass, 'cause if you don't accept this propitiation he just may start contemplating suicide again. Or take his money and go home.

Maybe they're SoundScan scammers like Vince Gill and Skid Row, reaping unwarranted cred from a revamped accounting system. Or maybe they're cool alternatives like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, poised to prove the sales appeal of self-dramatizing pessimism. Maybe they're even riding the actual-hit ""Friday I'm in Love,"" which actually sounds cheerful, though by Sunday it's over, actually. In any case, let it be noted that these new wave survivors, a specialized taste of undiscriminating undergraduates for years, have just now scored their biggest album ever, a redolent 13 years after they didn't actually kill that Arab. I ask you, where were the Moody Blues after 13 years? (Riding their second--and final--No. 1 album, since you didn't know.)

With Cyrus oversinging like Michael Bolton at a Perot rally, this album revolted me well before I got to its climactic title cut, about how brave guys help their fellow man by killing other men, presumably not fellow and most likely gooks or something. Only it turns out Michael Bolton was on the same side as Michael Stipe, and it also turns out that Cyrus manages a nice macho self-mockery on both his hit and the likes of ""Wher'm I Gonna Live?"" and ""I'm So Miserable."" Give him a few years of ups and downs and he could be the 21st-century Waylon Jennings. Can't wait, can you?

Dissing women is nothing. Any fool can dis women, educated fools included.

Serves him well in the business world, of course--nothing threatening about snide, goes with Hurby Luv Bug's beats. But there are less retrograde (and funnier) ways for rap to go pop.

Just like some ambivalent bloggerati--though for me the process involved historical research rather than a fond reminisce down my hard drive's memory lane--I prefer this fussy little succes d'estime's avant period. But not, of course, because I equate muso experiment with Good and pop accommodation with Evil. It's for the very reason their admirers proffer their forgiveness--the accommodation is half-assed, clumsy. These are ""rock songs"" in Ned Rorem's dreams--they're as ornate as a high-class geisha house. And where formerly Satomi Matsuzaki's Shonen-Knife-goes-to-college was a precious abrasion melded into strange background music you could ignore at will, here we're expected to ponder what she might Mean.

Five years ago, Denny sang lead with the progenitors of English folk-rock, Fairport Convention. Soon, however, she left-to-pursue-her-own-career. The group remained interesting enough to hold a following, but never broke through artistically or commercially, and although credible observers believed Denny had the stuff to become one of the finest women singers in the world, she didn't. One four-minute masterpiece on this otherwise sluggish album--the opening cut, written by Denny, called ""Solo""--deals obliquely with these losses. Now one hears that Fairport and Denny are regrouping. And so are Steppenwolf and John Kay.

Singer-songwriter folk fault Denver for his simple-minded escapism, implying a preference for subtle escapism in the manner of James &amp; Carly. But if escapism is the context maybe Denver's transparency is a (small) virtue. Good wholesome product, no falser (or true) than the run of the competition, tuneful and chaste with flatness for that common touch. Maybe the folk are offended because he sold four million albums in six months.

""New Life"" is worthy of Eno at his most rhapsodically technopastoral, but most of this tuneful pap crosses Meco (without the humble functionalism), Gary Numan (without the devotion to surface), and Kraftwerk (without the humor--oh, definitely without the humor). You'd think after seventy-five years people would have seen through the futurist fallacy--an infatuation with machinery is the ultimate one-sided love affair.

This is a monstrous record. The ""rock"" star who broke the Broadway barrier seems to be thinking Big Musical, in the urban sentimental mode (complete with Evil, of course) that does such small justice to the challenge of New York. Although fellow urban sentimentalist Robbie Robertson can achieve an awesome (almost fulsome) fullness with rock instrumentation, his production is basically pop program music. Yet somewhere in my cockles I found Diamond hooking me as I listened for the last time and I had to admit that it takes a special kind of chutzpah to create a monster.

On the other hand, how good can a Bo Diddley record be? Unlike Chuck Berry, who must also transcend a certain musical homogeneity, Bo hasn't written a whole songbook of great lyrics, and anyway, his homogeneity is a lot more homogeneous than Chuck's.

If any up-and-coming rock-and-roller aspires to auteur status it's Mark Knopfler, and among those with a taste for his rather corny plots (Romeo and Juliet, fancy that) this establishes his claim. Me, I note that this third album closes with his second gay-baiting song, and that I wasn't surprised . Better he should work on somebody else's stories--his guitar has emerged from Eric Clapton's shadow into a jazzy rock that muscles right past Larry Carlton and ilk. Steely Straits, anyone? Or would that be Dire Dan?

I admit that Mark Knopfler is a classy enough guitarist and producer to entice me into his nostalgic obsessions: at its best ""Telegraph Road"" sounds like supernal Mark-Almond, and the cheesy organ on ""Industrial Disease"" betrays a sense of humor. But the portentous arrangements on the other three cuts (right, that makes five, mean length 8:24) suggest nothing so much as ELP with blues roots. And Knopfler's sarcastic impression of a Harley Street M.D. on the very same ""Industrial Disease"" leaves no doubt that even his sense of humor is pompous.

Disinclined though I am to blame music on engineering, I reluctantly decided that what ailed this five-years-awaited fourth album wasn't just uncharacteristically inelegant arrangements and lyrics unworthy of Stony Browder but a fuzzy, cavernous mix that at times turned Cory Daye into another background element. Then I remembered that I'd gotten an advance last spring, and when I compared the two I was shocked. Remix engineers Gary Hellman and Rob Paustian--abetted I'm sure by schlock svengali Sandy Linzer and possibly Browder, credited with coproducing the new version--have ruined a crisp, spare, inelegant-on-purpose rock and roll album, smothering a great singer in artificial fog along the way. They've also deleted two songs, each strong enough to lead a side of the advance, neither (hmm) produced by Linzer. And you know what else? The little subhead that says ""featuring Cory Daye"" on the original cover is gone as well. Docked a notch or two to encourage boycott.

FALSE,C+,The Chronic,Dr. Dre,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1089,"
The crucial innovation of this benchmark album isn't its conscienceless naturalization of casual violence. It's Dre's escape from sampling. Other rappers, as they are called, have promised to create their own musical environments, usually without revealing how much art and how much publishing fuels their creative resolve. But Dre is the first to make the fantasy pay out big-time. The world he hears in his head isn't the up-to-date P-Funk fools say they hear--that would be too hard. Instead he lays bassline readymades under simulations of Bernie Worrell's high keyb sustain, a basically irritating sound that in context always signified fantasy, not reality--stoned self-loss or, at a best Dre never approaches, grandiose jive. This is bell-bottoms-and-Afros music, its spiritual source the blaxploitation soundtrack, and what it promises above all is boom times for third-rate flautists--sociopathic easy-listening. Even if it's ""just pop music,"" as some rationalize, it's bad pop music.

Dolby is a bright and honest fellow by no means in thrall to his synthesizers. ""She Blinded Me With Science"" proved he knows his way around a good beat, and the lyric sheet bespeaks a level of literacy rarely achieved by songwriters. But as with so many artists fascinated by synthesizers (and more than a few beguiled by their own literacy), his passion for texture subsumes what small knack he has for cruder, more linear devices. If there's an objective correlative for boring, that's it.

Anyone can sing rock, but that doesn't mean just anyone. Richard Nixon can't, and neither can Barbra Streisand, and I bet Peter Fonda can't either. Well, neither can Ray Manzarek or Robbie Krieger, whose voices share one salient quality: uptightness. This record has some terrific moments, starting with the first hook riff, and the musicians deserve their reputations. But even a good singer couldn't do much with a line like ""To roam is my infection,"" and this band could use a good singer.

Lazing around in Warren G's groove without making a pass at his tragic sense of life, these arrogant hangers-on would be yawns if they weren't the ugliest sexists to make a three week splash all year. Although the hatred is everywhere, it's most painful on an early ""skit""-song-""skit"" triptych: ""The Train"" (a backslapper about gang rape in the dark),""Fuck Ya Mouth"" (""To all our hookers and hoes""), and ""Slap a Hoe"" (a device invented for punks too yellow to do the job themselves). Heaven forfend the rappers actually doing any of these things, except maybe buy a Slap-a-Hoe--this isn't advocacy, it's constitutionally protected representation, harrumph. What I don't understand is why anyone who doesn't hate women is outraged when C. Delores Tucker goes just as far overboard in response. If they understand when self-serving black men express themselves in these, harrumph, metaphors, why don't they understand when self-serving black women counterattack by any means necessary?

As public figures and maybe as people, these imperialist wimps are the most deplorable pop stars of the postpunk if not post-Presley era. Their lyrics are obtuse at best, and if you'd sooner listen to a machine sing than Simon Le Bon, what are you going to do with both? Yet the hit singles which lead off each side are twice as pleasurable as anything Thomas Dolby is synthesizing these days. Which had better teach you something about imperialism.

Jon Landau wrote to suggest I give this a D, but that's pique. Conceptually, this is a brilliant album which is organized, I think, by two central ideas. First that ""self"" is most accurately defined (and depicted) in terms of the artifacts--in this case pop tunes and folk songs claimed as personal property and semispontaneous renderings of past creations frozen for posterity on a piece of tape and (perhaps) even a couple of songs one has written oneself--to which one responds.  Second, that the people's music is the music people like, Mantovani strings and all. But in order for a concept to work it has to be supported musically--that is, you have to listen. I don't know anyone, even vociferous supporters of this album, who plays more than one side at a time. I don't listen to it at all . The singing is not consistently good, though it has its moments, and the production--for which I blame Bob Johnston, though Dylan has to be listed as a coconspirator--ranges from indifferent to awful. It is possible to use strings and soprano choruses well, but Johnston has never demonstrated the knack. Other points: it's overpriced, the cover art is lousy, and it sounds good on WMCA.

Where Self-Portrait was at least weird, splitting the difference between horrible and hilarious, now he's forever professional--not a single remake honors or desecrates the original. All he can do to a song is Dylanize it, and thus his Danny Kortchmar band and his Steve Jones-Paul Simonon band are indistinguishable, immersed in that patented and by now meaningless one-take sound. And yet, and yet, there's a glimmer--the Dylan-Hunter throwaway ""Ugliest Girl in the World,"" guaranteed to remind the faithful how much fun the one-take ethos used to be.

Put on your neckboots and wade through the slickshit and you may get a kick from the lyrics--these boys like lotsa malaise with their mayonnaise.

Not as country-rocky as you might expect--the Eagles are pros who adapt to the times, and they make the music tough. I actually enjoy maybe half of these songs until I come into contact with the conceited, sentimental woman-haters who are doing the singing. I mean, these guys think punks are cynical and antilife?

This postsoul big band isn't as messy as the sum of its cross-references; on the second side especially, the heavy guitar, post-Memphis horns, and off-center 4/4 all work to similarly disquieting effect, and even the African kalimba is suitably weird. But at times the brass locks into gear just like Vegas, and the expert vocal harmonies neither fit the concept nor assert any personality of their own.

Leaping from mediocrity to wretched excess, they throw two discs on the market when they don't have the material for one. The lead cut/single, ""Let Me Talk,"" is too political in its fluffy way to break down the racism to today's top 40, and after that they never top the Doobies rip on side three--certainly not with the title number, which I blame on the fools who think they abandoned their principles when they gave up ersatz jazz.

They could use one--the three r&amp;b hits are set apart only by Barbara Roy's vibrato-tinged soul shouting.

Denying prior knowledge of Joy Division, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and Interpol, Staffordshire University's answer to the Arctic Monkeys cite as influences early R.E.M., Elbow, and the French Doors--not Jimbo in Paris, a Brooklyn band that shares members with, you know, Black Lipstick. I believe them, too. Though this strain of heartsick gravity was unknown on earth before Ian Curtis and the goth/new romantic inundation he heralded, it has since been imprinted on every Caucasian adolescent in the English-speaking world. And as leader Tom Smith demonstrates, it needn't be morbid or suicidal. His message is often sanely chin-up--as in ""Open your arms and welcome people to your town"" and even the relatively dark (if sonically comic) ""You don't need this disease you don't,"" 36 repetitions of which constitute virtually the entire lyric of ""Bullets.""

Roy Wood's departure leaves Jeff Lynne to re-create this band in his own image: a conventional art-rocker less ponderous and more long-winded than previously indicated, with an uncommonly lyrical side and his own sense of humor.

I like the way ""Mongoose"" grafts polyrhythms onto hard rock, and I'm pleased that they utter the word ""revolution"" with some notion of what it means.

I have no theoretical objection to the man's hard rock move--it's the dumb-ass conventionality of the actual hard rock in question that gives me a pain. Where Lloyd Maines and Ponty Bone were aces on their country-identified instruments, Ely's new guys are arena dorks in their dreams. You remember the tunes and licks after a while only because they're so similar to thousands of others you soon forgot. And where Ely's own songs have always worked best as change-of-pace, here they're expected to carry the shebang. Except for the febrile ""Imagine Houston,"" buried on side two, and maybe ""Cool Rockin' Loretta,"" a find of a throwaway but no more, they sink it instead.

Once they were winning wannabees stealing pop hooks in the basement.

Ugly as the Geto Boys and a lot dumber, the cross-dressing tale ""Jane 3"" climaxes with the rape she deserves; elsewhere the rhymes run three bozacks and three criminal-mindeds to one Mandela/Farrakhan.

""A bold new beginning,"" proclaims the sticker, and given their late-'80s sales it had better be, so essentially they go pop--rather than ""ironic"" new-wave metapop, a distinction that escaped every Tom Petty type who made Dave Stewart his new-waver of choice. Despite a few fabulous Elvis similes, this bold stroke is sorely lacking in je-ne-sais-quoi.

They're singing as good as ever, but not the same as ever--with the harmonies more luxurious and soulful, they can finally pass for grown men as they approach fifty. Unfortunately, maturity doesn't suit them any better than Dave Edmunds's lacquered, interpretation-enhancing production, because mature interpretation will never be their forte. They may sound like grown men and they may sound soulful, but that doesn't mean they sound like soulful grown men--a certain emotional complexity eludes them. Of all these hand-tailored comeback-special songs, only Paul Kennerly's ""The First in Line"" and Don's own ""Asleep"" are simple enough to fit.

It's a little disorienting to encounter a dance music that lives or dies aesthetically by its lyrics--partying's not supposed to be that way. Yet here it is. Back when Winston Henry was a struggling young soca man, he came by his sobriquet honestly; these days he doesn't miss a chance to kiss Reagan's ass or make like ""our skin color not get in our way."" As a result (?), his groove gets nowhere. Interesting that back when he was a struggling young soca man his ""Lorraine"" sported as ferocious a hook as the style has known, while now his pop moves are reduced to a certain slackening of the tempo and the occasional keyb texture.

""My category is alternative, period,"" avers the last intelligent person to make such a claim in this millennium. He doesn't want to be folk or New Age, and who can blame him? But if he were, some rich dunderhead might insist that he treat blues and pop rarities to his dolorously deliberate touch, like on those old Reprise albums Byron Coley sneers at. Instead he's encouraged to stagger toward an obscure destination mere mortals would noodle around, dumbfounding bystanders with the scraps of sound that flake off his beard as he goes. Once in a while tunes poke through the refuse, notably that of ""Chelsey Silver, PleaseCall Home."" These occasion proud huzzahs from young fools who can only forgive themselves such emoluments after a good cleansing scourge of spare solo indirection.

Back before they were musicians--before they played riffs requiring digital articulation and sang the occasional backup or even response--they tossed off live product all the time. The formula was simple--Mark E. harangued and the band crashed and droned. No atmospheric gunk like ""Mollusc in Tyrol"" or incompetent covers like ""Pinball Machine"" and, yes, ""Victoria,"" which in the great tradition of bad live albums betrays its studio version. ""Mollusc in Tyrol"" and ""Pinball Machine,"" God help us, are studio versions.

Stuck between pretentious young purists who believe catchy love songs betray their hardcore heritage and eager younger fans who believe catchy love songs fulfill their teenthrob destiny, these Warped Tour cover boys aren't terrible, but are they ever ordinary. Only their record company would claim that emotional vocals, dramatic dynamics, poppy-punky tempos, and not actually all that catchy tunes add up to ""their own sound.""

Since the singing makes Rex Harrison sound like Mario Lanza, it's tuneful in only the most abstract sense. (Already the fanzines are paying attention.) Without the usual vocal surges it's also quite static. (Veddy interesting.) What hooks there are inhere in the chord changes. (Sounds more like art all the time.)

But the more I listen the more irrelevant that seems--when you crave a little authenticity, you don't go to a cute factory for it. What they need is more stringent quality controls than they're likely to get from chief producer Robin Halpin--not to mention the bozos who captain the ill-conceived Fat Boys excursion, or even ""Tender Love""'s Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who've never made balladry their long suit.

He's a singer who's more interested in impressing the deacons (and their wives) than feeling the spirit--overripe, self-involved, and in the end pretentious. And this material is far from his best--stuck with the low-grade rock gentility of ""Walk Away Renee"" and ""If I Were a Carpenter"" and the sermonizing of ""What Is Man"" and ""In These Changing Times,"" he's a typical victim of Motown's decadence. Despite some good rhythm tracks--they always seem to get good rhythm tracks out there--the only one of these songs you'll remember fondly is ""Just Seven Numbers,"" a simple-minded throwaway about swallowing your pride and making that call.

I overlooked it on Maggot Brain because the music was so difficult to resist, but here the strings (told you about their taste in white people), long-windedness (another double-LP that should be a single), and programmatic lyrics (""Miss Lucifer's Love"" inspires me to mention that while satanism is a great antinomian metaphor it often leads to murder, rape, etc.) leave me free to exercise my prejudices.

If Gabriel can't resist orchestrating his rock and roll, better he should lay on third-world rhythms than simulate first-world themes. But self-conscious primitivism hasn't cured his grandiosity--lyrical protestations notwithstanding, the only time those rhythms are around him and inside him, in control and in his soul, is on ""Shock the Monkey,"" which has a good old first-world hook. Only Gabriel probably doesn't want to be cured--bet he admires African music not because it flows like a stream but because it taps the divine, and while he may know in his head that animists can't have one without the other, he's not about to become a believer.

FALSE,C+,Cats Under the Stars,Jerry Garcia,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6884,"
There seem to be three good songs here until you listen to the lyric of ""Rubin and Cherise."" The other two, ""Cats Under the Stars"" and ""Rhapsody in Red,"" are both about music. Come to think of it, so is ""Rubin and Cherise.""
"
FALSE,C+,Live,Marvin Gaye,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6887,"
There's inspired singing here, but even on the stupendous version of ""Trouble Man"" Gene Page's orchestra intrudes--Gaye hasn't managed to mix the instruments into the unified background presence of his recent studio albums. Also: seven great oldies banished to a ""Fossil Medley,"" and ""Jan,"" conceivably the worst song he's ever written.
"
FALSE,C+,I Want You,Marvin Gaye,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6888,"
This isn't as disgraceful as would first appear--as disco-identified mood mewzick for light necking it offers nifty engineering, pleasant harmonies, and the occasional snatch of melody. But as a Marvin Gaye record it's a Leon Ware record. Ware is the producer who cowrote every one of these . . . tunes? segments? . . . cuts (which is more than Marvin can claim). But was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it.
"
FALSE,C+,Dream of a Lifetime,Marvin Gaye,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4858,"
Like a lot of rock and roll geniuses, Gaye was also a nut (or jerk, if you prefer). One reason he worked so assiduously in the studio was that he was loath to let us see all the way inside him, which means that these posthumously consummated outtakes and private jokes are by his own best standard too unmediated to carry much aesthetic weight. By my own best standards, too. On ""Ain't It Funny (How Things Turn Around),"" the only track that bears Gaye's rhythmic and harmonic signature rather than Gordon Banks's or Harvey Fuqua's schlock-it-to-'em, and ""Savage in the Sack,"" a joke he knew enough to find funny, his wit and charm shine through. Elsewhere he's just letting off guilt in heavenly visions or sexual fantasies out of control. Maybe bondage freaks will find ""Masochistic Beauty"" a turn-on--what do I know? I know what I infer from ""Sanctified Lady"" (formerly ""Sanctified Pussy"")--that this man found himself despising women for doing the kinky things he forced them to do. And there's no way that's a turn-on.

FALSE,C+,Romantically Yours,Marvin Gaye,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4859,"
The sad testament of a tormented weirdo who longed to redeem himself in the world of middle-class convention. On side one he covers ""standards"" that are beneath him (""More""), beyond him (""Fly Me to the Moon""), or beside the point (""Maria""). On side two he attempts to write his own. The singing isn't bad--was it ever? The strings are godawful.

FALSE,C+,Bloodshot,The J. Geils Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6895,"
Never has the mass audience blunted a group's fine points so quickly. Tight arrangements? They boogie endlessly through riffs they were playing three years ago. Low-profile funk? Peter Wolf now shows off every emotional inadequacy of his phony growl. Resourceful material? The borrowed songs are almost as bad as the originals.  Humor? Their idea of a funny is to rhyme""shiny"" and ""heinie."" I hope they know where to shine this one.

FALSE,C+,Love Stinks,The J. Geils Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4861,"
So it's broad--nothing wrong with broad. Just ask the uproarious single and title tune. But really, the rest is more overbearing white r&amp;b--Seth Justman's organ blams, not to mention his furbelows on the endless-at-3:35 ""Desire,"" are the work of a man who thinks ""No Anchovies, Please"" is funny.

For a while I was tempted to buzz Phil Collins over his former fearless leader. He's a warmer singer, God help them both, and the formerly useless Tony Banks proves adept with the keyb hooks. But in the end I couldn't tolerate the generalization density--not just of the lyrics (where Peter Gabriel's personal and geopolitical details offer some evidence that he's been there) but of the hooks, which end up feeling coercive, an effect unmitigated by Collins's whomping instrumental technique. And just to prove they're still Genesis, we get solos.

FALSE,C+,Thanks I'll Eat It Here,Lowell George,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6907,"
You are of course familiar with the recording industry phenomenon in which a vocalist enters the studio (or many studios) with a few (or many) well-regarded musicians and they all ""cut"" between eight and eleven songs written by the vocalist, the vocalist's friends, and some lucky black people. Here the smartest member of Little Feat does this. Unfortunately, singing has never been his strong point, and the compositions are as flaccid as any he's ever made public. Or maybe it only sounds that way because we're used to hearing him atop Little Feat's contradictory funk, not the obliging groove well-regarded musicians usually achieve under such circumstances.

FALSE,C+,Obituary,George Gerdes,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6908,"
Gerdes casts his jaundiced larynx upon foibles cultural and countercultural as well as the usual romantic reverses. Very waggish.

FALSE,C+,Out of the Blue,Debbie Gibson,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8237,"
People think there's something cute about this schemer, but I ask you--is it really possible to be a self-made millionaire and the girl next door simultaneously? I'll take a Harvard M.B.A. any day. Paul Anka wrote his own songs too, and he had more of a flair for language. As for beats, well, I'm not going to argue with ""Only in My Dreams"" or ""Shake Your Love."" But the one she produced by herself is a flat-out dog.

FALSE,C+,Electric Youth,Debbie Gibson,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6087,"
Casting about for a clue to this cipher, I found a gem in the bio: ""My mom and dad took me to literally thousands of auditions, lessons, and performances."" Making her a showbiz kid manque who immersed her perfect pitch and competitive Chopin in disco and Billy Joel, with every pop dream supported by doting parents who didn't want to raise a rebel and got their wish--so far. Unable to fall back on even an alienated childhood for inspiration, her music is synthesis without thesis or antithesis. A mimic and nothing more, she emits banalities about relationships and life choices that are no doubt deeper than anything she's actually experienced--so far.
"
FALSE,C+,I Still Believe in You,Vince Gill,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4124,"
As bland as Nicolette Fogelberg, with Tony Brown running the broad-spectrum lyrics through his good-taste machine as if he wants to be Peter Asher when he grows up, Gill is the real country-hunk menace because he's so reproducible. I admit they pin a few classics--""Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away"" and ""Say Hello"" have the ring of general truth. But when they don't, it's '70s singer-songwriter all over again. Eddie Rabbitt just didn't know how to market himself.
"
FALSE,C+,Gilley's Greatest Hits Vol. 1,Mickey Gilley,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6913,"
Gilley is Jerry Lee Lewis's cousin and reputed imitator. He's also proprietor of the largest country-music club in the known world. But his semi-mythic stature is unjustified. His piano arpeggios never get mean. His voice lacks all of Jerry Lee's shrill urgency--more like Jim Reeves with a (certain) sense of rhythm, or Bob Luman without the bite, or maybe even Perry Como Arkansas-born and Houston-raised. And his taste is mainstream country at best. If you like songs with roses in them--three of the ten here qualify--you'll enjoy this more than I do. But expect no rock and roll nor rockabilly nor any but the tamest honky-tonk.

FALSE,C+,New Miserable Experience,Gin Blossoms,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5903,"
Even if you hate weak guys a lot more than I do, you can't deny that ""Hey Jealousy"" is a classic--Peter Buck himself would kill (or at least steal) for that gold-plated guitar hook. But though the guy who came up with it is now dead, the group and its handlers jangle on through mediocre follow-ups programmers wouldn't have played twice before ""Hey Jealousy"" softened them up. Released in 1992, the album is now double platinum, on the charts a year and a half after it broke. And I wouldn't put it past them to sell the next one too. The marketplace--what mere journalist can fathom it?
"
FALSE,C+,Songs From Liquid Days,Philip Glass,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4865,"
From Satyagraha to Mishima, much of Glass's recent work has invoked the mood if not the methods of nineteenth-century classical music, a realm of discourse where I'm reluctant to pass judgment, though I will mention that this hardly makes him unique among soundtrack composers. When it comes to vocal production, though, I have my proud prejudices. Without passing judgment on Satyagraha's Douglas Perry, who applies his tenor to one song here, I'll insist without fear of ignorance that he's a less than apt model for the Roches and Bernard Fowler (Linda Ronstadt can do what she wants). Even Suzanne Vega's lyrics read better than they sound. Which may just mean Glass is too spiritually enlightened to set meaningful texts to music.

""We're everything your parents ever warned you about,"" they warn. ""We can't feel nothin', got no heart or soul,"" they boast. ""The Godz are rock and roll machines,"" they admit.

FALSE,C+,Moontan,Golden Earring,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6918,"
The single off this, ""Radar Love,"" was voted best of 1973 in England but ran out of radio detecting and ranging waves in this country, which made Grand Funk's ""The Loco-Motion"" number one instead. Yah, yah, our stupid-rock is better than your stupid-rock--especially when yours comes from Holland.

FALSE,C+,Timeless,Goldie,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1416,"
If Goldie is to jungle what Tricky is to trip hop--the ""accessible"" name brand for strangers in wonderland--then Martin Denny was Dr. Livingston. Occasionally some diva takes up a tune, but mainly this pleasant, far from arrhythmic soundspace posits an impressionistic respite from hardcore techno, with warm links to fusion, movie music, and the tragically neglected legacy of Rick Wakeman.

FALSE,C+,The Chronicles of Life and Death,Good Charlotte,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12592,"
Like a thousand hit bands before them, they've seen the great big world and feel wiser, and like a thousand hit bands before them, they've forgotten the wisdom--strike that, the knowledge--that made them a hit to begin with. Beyond some rich-and-famous irony, not a single suburban detail soils an hour of good intentions. And you know the music overreaches too.
"
FALSE,C+,Bad Boy,Robert Gordon,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4878,"
As our increased familiarity and his increased facility reduce his dependence on ironic context, he becomes unnecessary--totally unnecessary, I mean. Sure he uses his excellent voice better than genre loyalists give him credit for. But that makes him either a ""real"" rockabilly or an interpreter with moldy-fig tastes--competition for either Ray Campi or Roomful of Blues. I mean, like wow. He was more interesting, and more emotionally effective, as a joke with no punch line.
"
FALSE,C+,Fresh Fish Special,Robert Gordon With Link Wray,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6924,"
Gordon has perfected his craft since cutting his first album, and the follow-up is less lively as a result, because the heroic stance he's homed in on is rockabilly balladeer, which is a lot harder to approximate than '50s rock and roller. After all, the credulous lucidity of Presley's slow songs is beyond mortal imitation, and how much secondhand early Twitty (or Husky) does anyone need?

FALSE,C+,Movement,The Gossip,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11939,"
A fat sexy lesbian teenager whose entire trio escaped Arkansas for Olympia? A big voice with its emotions out front? What's not to love? Nothing, declare gossipmongers bowled over by their strenuous gigs. To which well-wishers must inquire, Er, how about music? Beth Ditto gives no indication she could sing the tunes that aren't here. Brace Howdeshall applies punk chops to a soul concept. Kathy Mendonca doesn't know what an offbeat is.

What's happening to me? Maybe it's that damned billboard. Or maybe I'm beginning to appreciate--I said appreciate--their straight-ahead celebration of beat, amplification, and youthful camaraderie. After all, rock and roll has always been loud, and its rhythms have always been described as ""heavy."" And at least Mark Farner doesn't pretend to bluesmanship.

FALSE,C+,They Said It Couldn't Be Done,Grandmaster Flash,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4882,"
I was and am rooting for Flash, Creole, and Rahiem--they have good hearts, and from the Fats Waller cover and the way ""Iko Iko"" sneaks scratch-style into the lead cut, you can tell they're trying. But Creole isn't powerful enough for a lead rapper, Rahiem's crooning is wimp ordinaire without bombast for ballast, and sometime Herbie Hancock vocalist Gavin Christopher not only isn't anywhere near as funky as the Sugarhill gang (which I assume everyone knows) but has none of the pop production flair that might move them into Rick James territory, assuming that's even a desirable destination any more. And the words! ""Sign of the Times"" is the kind of confused protest you could hear on sucker twelve-inches a year ago, ""Jailbait"" isn't so fucking good-hearted, and ""Girls Love the Way He Spins"" is the claim that's supposed to make the competition hang up their mikes and go home. Why do groups break up? It's enough to make you lose your faith in capitalism.

FALSE,C+,On the Strength,Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4884,"
Like a big band that costs too much to put on the road, their fluid five-man rat-a-tat-tat is a throwback to a more innocent era; their attempts to keep up--their ""boyee""s, their samples, their Steppenwolf cameo--are depressingly flat. And despite an amazing ""I have a dream"" cover, Mele-Mel's return doesn't do all that much for their moral fervor. A ""Gold"" worthy of the subject wouldn't slip past miners and murders on its way to the IDs, and to hear onetime love man Rahiem make pimp jokes is to wonder just how he'll get by after their next label drops them.
"
FALSE,C+,Going for Broke,Eddy Grant,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1128,"
Though it pains me to put it in black and white, Grant is half hack, and pop gambles are by their very nature never as all-or-nothing as his brave title pretends. The dance cuts don't walk on sunshine, the rockers sow no special feel for that beat, and as a ballad singer he's such a born belter it's amazing he brings off even the charming ""Blue Wave.""

FALSE,C+,Mighty Joe Moon,Grant Lee Buffalo,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5904,"
Grant Lee Phillips doesn't sing subtly enough to pine so lyrically or forcefully enough to suffer so unremittingly. That folkloric drawl may be the way he talks, but it sounds like he picked it up at the movies along with the rest of his ideas. It's pointless to suggest he stick in a few laughs because there's no chance they'll be funny. I do recommend, however, that he abandon his quest for the meaning of John Wayne Gacy.

Despite the hooks, highlighted unnaturally by do-or-die production, this is definitely the Dead, not Journey or Starship. But only ""When Push Comes to Shove,"" a ruminative catalogue of paranoid images that add up to one middle-aged man's fear of love, shows up the young ignorami and old fools who've lambasted them as symbols of hippie complacency since the '60s were over. One problem with the cosmic is that it doesn't last forever.

Can these be the same guys who backed Joe Cocker? From producer and pseudonymous pianist Chris Stainton I expected better--but not, I guess, from vocalist-composer (formerly just guitarist) Henry McCullough. The Band gets away with putting a nonsinger up front by shuffling five of them, and all five nonsing with more passion and style than Henry.

Tompall Glaser's slurred, soft-focus baritone might grow on me, I suppose, but as of now he's one more singing legend I'd rather hear about than hear. A touch too sentimental, a touch too nasty underneath, and whether he's playing Stills to Waylon's Young or Nash to Waylon's Crosby, it's all sour goop to me.

FALSE,C+,American Idiot,Green Day,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12713,"
If you're wondering what this concept album means, don't labor over the lyric booklet. As Billie Joe knows even if he doesn't come out and say it--he doesn't come out and say lots of obvious stuff--this is a visual culture. So examine the cover. That red grenade in the upraised fist? It's also a heart--a bleeding heart. Which he heaves as if it'll explode, only it won't, because he doesn't have what it takes to pull the pin. The emotional travails of two clueless punks--one passive, one aggressive, both projections of the auteur--stand in for the sociopolitical content that the vague references to Bush, Schwarzenegger, and war (not any special war, just war) are thought to indicate. There's no economics, no race, hardly any compassion. Joe name-checks America as if his hometown of Berkeley was in the middle of it, then name-checks Jesus as if he's never met anyone who's attended church. And to lend his maunderings rock grandeur, he ties them together with devices that sunk under their own weight back when the Who invented them. Sole rhetorical coup: makes being called a ""faggot"" something to aspire to, which in this terrible time it is.

Nomenclature niggle: not ""chamber pop."" Serving up two kinds of genteel escape, pastoral and aesthetic, this is chamber folk-rock--or, less kindly, folk-prog. From the Beach Boys on down, chamber pop is about tune and hook embellishment. These guys are in it for the atmosphere. There are vaguer lyrics out there, but the reason the band's claque is gaga for the line ""We'll swim around like two dories"" isn't how evocative the image is (it isn't, which should count for something), but the extra squeeze of choirboy tight-ass Daniel Rossen pretties it up with. Applied to the straightforward ""Deep Blue Sea"" on Dark Was the Night, their skilled playing remains modest enough, but on this subtler and more pretentious material, the skills predominate, and just in case they don't, let's add a string quartet here and real choirboys there. Plus, they still hum. Less than last time, but a lot.

I prefer this hunky purveyor of semiclassical ear massage to his polar coordinates, John Raitt and Andrea Bocelli--lacking the voice of either, he rarely shows off, and the ease is a relief.

Sick of going into debt to make exquisitely conceived studio albums that don't sell, Arlo here delivers a mostly live LP--with undistinguished  folkie-rockie added by his road band, Shenandoah--that strings together pointless Elvis and Beatles covers, one-dimensional folk songs, and a tall tale that would have trouble making first string guard on a high school basketball team.

Hagen is one of those Yurrupean artistes who consent to perform ""rock"" because it's vunderful theater. Big of her with her operatic training and all, dontcha think? And she does have a new-wave sense of humor--instead of taking on Maria Callas with her umpteen-octave range she does impressions of Linda Blair and Mercedes McCambridge. Unfortunately for those of us who believe rock is vunderful songs, her drama transcends the form. The exception is the scary antiheroin minidrama ""Smack Jack.""

Four country hits on Haggard's first straight studio album in a year and a half, but only the simple goodbye song ""I Can't Be Myself"" escapes bathos. ""The Farmer's Daughter,"" ""I'm a Good Loser,"" and ""I've Done It All"" have an acceptably archetypal ring. Forget the rest--Hag already has.

Country legend or no, Haggard has no more business doing an album about broken relationships than Public Image Ltd. As a result, material that might be touching from a more austere singer is barely credible, and the three songs that open side two--one by Merle and Jimmy Dickens, one by Merle's off-and-on wife Leona Williams, and one by the austere Willie Nelson--ooze with the kind of moist self-pity ordinarily encountered only in leaders of the men's liberation movement.

It wouldn't be strictly accurate to claim Haggard has pissed his talent away, but the temptation to say so anyhow beckons. His laid-back vocal signature is the lazy man's friend. His originals suggest that he has no reject pile--just entunes any old piece of verse for the annual session. And again and again his famous ecumenicism camouflages lame genre excursions--on this album, the Bellamy-reggae ""Sea of Heartbreak."" A slight improvement over 1988's feckless Out Among the Stars, due mostly to a formulaic title tune Hag didn't write. But if he thinks he isn't getting away with shit, he needs a shrink.

Beloved of their art therapist, their parents, Lester Bangs, and whoever owns Armageddon, Jad and David Fair's boxed three-record set is enriched with a poster, a (truncated) lyric sheet, and a one-pic-per-thick-red-page comic entitled ""Becky the Monkey."" Most of the budget went into the display--the sound suits the one-take learning-our-chords musicianship and vocals that make Jonathan Richman sound like Vaughan Monroe. Originals usually concern girls and sometimes mention artists; covers include ""Funky Broadway,"" ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" and ""She's Cracked."" Also included are several lengthy instrumental experiments and a live disc. Won't these superstars ever learn to boil their self-indulgences down into one tight, well-selected album?

It wasn't inevitable that the return to form heralded in the trades should accompany the waning of whatever made them mildly interesting to the so-called consumer press, but the coincidence is worth noting. Except for ""Kiss on My List"" (number-one singles are laws unto themselves), the mildly interesting stuff is commercial filler: gently clever like ""Big Kids,"" secretly dark like ""Diddy Doo Wop (I Hear the Voices)."" And for all the hoo-hah surrounding Daryl and his ""repressed"" solo album, his singing is as pallid as his partner's: ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling"" is the greatest thing to happen to oldies stations since Grease.

Break up? Them? Nah, that was just a sabbatical, and to prove it here they are, crafting that platinum as craftily as they know how to justify their brand new advance. Daryl's stiff had nothing to do with it. Of course not. 'Cept that both records do overdo the overdubs, less fulsomely on this very model of second-hand black than when Daryl calls all the shots, but fatally nevertheless. I dare you to make out hitbounds like ""Missed Opportunity"" and ""Rockability"" or talismans like ""Downtown Life"" and ""Keep On Pushin' Love"" in the time it takes a music director to push reject. The album came out in May. It's dropping out of the top 200. It's not platinum. Justice abides in the world.

This Finnish fivesome is led by glam guys named Monroe and McCoy who yowl English-language lyrics that must impress Finns more than native speakers like myself. The quintet's patina of two-guitar anarchy is cute if overcalculated, but they seem to have spent more time contemplating their Dolls photos than their Dolls records.

Abetted by Brian Ahern, who would have been wise to add some Anne Murray schlock, Harris shows off a pristine earnestness that has nothing to do with what is most likable about country music and everything to do with what is most suspect in ""folk."" Presumably, Gram Parsons was tough enough to discourage this tendency or play against it, but as a solo mannerism it doesn't even ensure clear enunciation: I swear the chorus of the best song here sounds like it begins: ""I will rub my asshole/In the bosom of Abraham.""

This flows better than the first, but it also makes clear that Emmylou is just another pretty voice, a country singer by accident. I mean, Linda Ronstadt has the best female voice in country music, and even she doesn't satisfy the way an original like Dolly Parton or Loretta Lynn does. And since there's not a cover version here that equals its prototype, all she accomplishes with her good taste in material is to send you scurrying for the sources. I prefer Donna Fargo. Not Lynn Anderson, though.

Though the polyrhythms degenerate at times into steamy clutter, Harrison comes up with keyboard hooks I'd like to hear elsewhere; I recommend ""Slink"" to G. Clinton Assoc. But Jerry should keep his teeth clenched at all times. Bright enough not to try to carry a tune or anything, he apparently hasn't figured out that the talky voiceovers he essays instead are the worst fad of the year--it's as hard to avoid making them pompous or nagging or twerpy as it is, well, to sing.

She's known since ""Rapture"" where the dance action was, which is why Nile Rodgers produced KooKoo. So this last-ditch two-LP disco-targeted repackage, half of it totally extraneous 1988 remixes of group and solo titles by Jellybean, Coldcut, and lesser mortals, proves that knowing it ain't doing it. The spare-to-wimpy electrotrack of the original ""Rapture,"" for instance, is decisively more graceful than Teddy Riley's new beats. DOR was her destiny. And new jack is a new generation.

And with most of the hits all the way studio, the live stuff is long on covers, permitting Ann to run her suboperatic chops smack into ""Unchained Melody"" and ""Tell It Like It Is."" But the live ""Bebe Le Strange"" and the distaff ""Rock and Roll"" make them sound like contenders we need nevertheless.

Nope, Don wants drama and plenty of it--seven of 10 instrumental intros are 30 seconds plus, with three up around an L.A. minute (as distinguished from a ""New York Minute,"" 'cause Don says your life can change in one of those).

Suddenly, for no discernible reason, the Hollies seem to be aiming their schlock at the housewife market. The nadir, an attempted artsong called ""Marigold Gloria Swansong,"" is as aimless as bad (i.e. current) Bee Gees; usually they come on like the Sonny and Cher of slick harmony. The music hasn't lost its iridescence, but though they do generate one great soap opera--""Too Young to Be Married""--most of this is too crass for giggles.

It takes more than unsullied venality and the will to power to reign as the most revolting pop singer in Christendom. It takes active aesthetic miscalculation and, truth be told, more than a little luck. Like falling into the lame dance grooves of Jermaine Jackson and the odious megaschlock of Michael Masser, with Narada Michael Walden limited to ""How Will I Know""--which becomes your breakthrough song as well as the only critically forgivable thing on your best-selling debut album in history. So this time Walden gets seven shots, with Masser down to two and Jermaine returned to the bosom of his family, and the results are forgivable--she does have a good voice, you know.

Between ""Dead Homiez,"" which mourned murdered friends in a voice some called soft, and Boyz N the Hood, which required him to simulate thought, the St. Ides spokesperson was worried about his image. To use the only noun in the hard lexicon that suggests normal human sensitivities, he was acting like a ""faggot."" So here he reclaims his perpetually threatened manhood. Early on he mitigates the usual gangsta shit--gat as penis and pit bull, female body as pestilence and plague--with such touches as an antigang track and a nurse with attitude. But eventually he breaks new ground. In addition to many fascinated rhymes on the complex subject of who fucks who in the ass and how, he nuts out on white devils who crave ""a taste of chocolate"" because ""white bitches have no butt and no chest."" He inveighs against ""Jap"" and ""Jew."" And he proposes a ""nationwide boycott"" of Korean-owned inner-city businesses that escape the torch, poking gentle fun at the Korean accent along the way.

In a year when hards from Cam'ron to Trick Daddy illed with enough self-critical ambivalence and sly style to keep moralists off balance, Cube's boasts and threats are as utilitarian as Chucky Thompson's emailed-in beats. With faking the gat life no longer a realistic possibility, he's down to pretending his penis is a lethal weapon. And lest you hold his nonexistent sense of humor against him, the honcho orders up a Chris Rock cameo.

On ""God Forgive Me,"" the finale until the wittily grandiose Zionist-baiter ""Exodus"" was tacked on, comes a belated hint of the sardonic persona-mongering that once terrified a republic: Ice begs absolution for inventing the ""gangsta rap"" that ""changed the course of the world."" Maybe that's not as ridiculous as it seems. But certainly no such claim can be made for this clipped collection of pimp-dope-biz boasts/tales, which transcend genre hackwork only when anabused 16-year-old coos the title hook of ""Always Wanted To Be a Hoe"" like she can't wait to get the next dick in her mouth. Watching the O.G.'s back is a jaw-dropping procession of old-timers you hoped had gone into management, including Brother Marquis, Ant Banks, King Tee, Onyx, Kam, and, always last and always least, wee little Too Short.

Of course they know how to play--art-rockers usually do.

Distinguishable from competing relics of the Church of Iggy by the oddly qualified boast ""The Great Lost Stooges Album?"" (they do enjoy their punctuation over at Bomp!!), this one recycles the Raw Power follow-ups of the Rubber Legs EP, with dimmer sound than the ruinous underbassing Bowie inflicted on that piece of classic-openers-plus-filler, and also dimmer songs--""Cock in My Pocket"" might make somebody a second encore, ""Rubber Legs"" is a worthier title cut than ""Open Up and Bleed,"" and the rest belonged on the cutting room floor. Plus, wouldn't you know, equally dim live tapes designed to prove yet again that they did actually vamp longer than Hawkwind and Grinderswitch put together--anything rather than get down to business. Really, folks. He was seminal. He was damn good. He's not bad to this day. He wrote more anthems than Richard Berry himself. But anyone who thinks he's the spirit of the music has been taken in by the doomed theory that rock and roll is transgressive by definition.

The two first-rate songs, ""Minefield"" (about dancing in one) and ""Give Me"" (""What you can't get back""), were both singles. Each leads off a side that passes from the mind before it vacates the ear. Only the surrounding confusion of configurations indicates that the year isn't 1962--the B side of the ""Minefield"" twelve-inch features a ""Give Me"" remix plus the very mildly interesting ""No. 4.""

Compared to the diluted simple syrup of Swirl 360 or the teen-idol rappa-billy of Jimmy Ray, Imbruglia's modern pop is Rumours. Not only is she extraordinarily pretty without being too blatant in her babitude, she's got the brains and will to make up her own songs (and did I mention how pretty she is?). Thus she's earned our respect. But under all their state-of-the-studio-art, her competent songs are no more distinctive than the competent songs of hundreds of less pretty women. This was no stiff--RCA milked platinum and a follow-up single out of the sure shot she didn't write herself. But we should be proud that iconicity proved beyond Imbruglia's means. It's three cheers for democracy every time someone goes even a little broke underestimating the taste of the American public.

Incubus's wrinkle on awful points up how old-fashioned the death-metal and rap-fusion approaches to hard rock have become. The new menace is prog-variegated structures, tempo shifts, lyric interludes, DJ flava, and (daringly) love songs. This nets a lovely eight-minute closer featuring Steve Vai's ""ko-kyu,"" which sounds like a koto to me. It also nets many mediocre pop songs with pretensions.

Refreshing for white guys, especially white guys as dumb as these two, to complain about the slave owner on the dollar bill--simpleminded, but an act of cultural nonconformity nonetheless. Cool to give away a special-offer CD where you rap over stolen gangsta tracks, too. But when a real gangsta's bitch fucks his homey he kills everybody in sight. These kiss-offs just kill the girl, every chance they get. And though they claim clown, they rarely get funnier than ""I'd cut my head off but then I would be dead,"" and that on the cut everybody uses to prove how dumb they are. Personally, I think saying fuck 93 times in one song is a riot. Tell Fatboy Slim the news.

They bitch because everybody compares them to Joy Division, and they're right. It's way too kind, and I say that as someone who thanks Ian Curtis for making New Order possible. Joy Division struggled against depression rather than flaunting it, much less wearing it like a designer suit. What's truly depressing is that, just as the hairy behemoths of the grunge generation looked back to the AOR metal they immersed in as teens, these fops tweak the nostalgia of young adults who cherish indistinct memories of much worse bands than Joy Division, every one of them English--Bauhaus, Ultravox, Visage, Spandau Ballet, Tears for Fears. At a critical moment in consciousness they exemplify and counsel disengagement, self-seeking, a luxurious cynicism. Says certified British subject Peter Banks: ""Emotions are standard and boring.

Liberal plaints about hardcore protofascism are so ignorant that it's a little surprising to find a band who fit the bill. Oh, they do an anti-Moonie number and probably couldn't hack it in the KKK, but ""Put on Your Warpaint"" (""They send us spies/We send them grain"") is galloping anti-Russkie paranoia and ""White, Straight and Male"" (""I'm a victim of the quota system"") middle-class backlash at its most vicious. Relatively oblique about race (""no speak-a English"") and women (""I don't wanna catch your herpes""), they make it up on gays; though homophobia is only to be expected in sexually insecure young men whose brains are up their asses, and though pedophilia is hardly beyond criticism, I do think ""Man/Boy Love Sickie""--""You've got no human rights/We have to protect""--goes a bit far. Worst of all, sometimes they make it stick: ""White Castle at 3 A.M."" and ""Dance Club Meat Market"" are riotously memorable, two more scary reminders that lots of straight white males are feeling more squeeze than their talents deserve these days.

An orchestral album? By Joe Jackson? Sounded like the quickest reject in history, but I should have known better than to expect something so distinctive from this perpetually well-meaning guy. Not terrible by any means.

FALSE,C+,Maybe Tomorrow,Jackson 5,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7070,"
It's getting serious when the only discernible appeal of the title hit is that Michael is singing. The follow-up ""Never Can Say Goodbye,"" has more going for it. As do ""Sixteen Candles,"" originated by the Crests, and ""Honey Chile,"" originated by Martha &amp; the Vandellas.

FALSE,C+,The Flag,Rick James,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5064,"
I generally ignore charges that political content is commercially motivated, but with James I buy 'em. The Real Rick was the moist romantic fop of Glow, and when his self-expression didn't get over he churned out some lines on the Bomb, honing his craft by the by.

FALSE,C+,Wonderful,Rick James,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5065,"
Free at last from Mr. Gordy's plantation, James gives up that begged, borrowed, or stolen funk. ""Loosey's Rap"" casts Roxanne Shante as skeezer and proud (kudos in the Special Thanks list but not the credits to Big Daddy Kane and Marley Marl); ""So Tight"" is expert Larry Blackmon (ditto to ""Cameo for inspiration""); James himself could have sired ""Judy"" and ""Wonderful"" and ""Love's Fire."" But he still can't resist ballads, a big mistake for a man who spells l-u-v like c-u-m. Docked a notch for first peeping as ""the girls go down,"" then suggesting that a devil lesbian get straight by dropping to her knees and fishing his dick out.

FALSE,C+,Kettle Whistle,Jane's Addiction,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5206,"
As its current projects crumble from irrelevance to negative cash flow, a band that never made music or money commensurate with its myth bestows upon a shock-sated marketplace outtakes, demos, live tracks, and four proofs of physical reunion. Chutzpah has never been Perry Bernstein's problem.

This man has the looks and voice and technique and support of an instant superstar. So why isn't he? Maybe because he neither writes nor interprets songs with the soul to match his freeze-dried facility.

FALSE,C+,Bark,Jefferson Airplane,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7106,"
This isn't as bad as the faithless claim (a lot better than Bite, for instance), but it's definitely a collection of weirdnesses rather than an album: duh boys in duh band sing a cappella, Grace sings German, Grace defies cop, Hot Tuna outtake, fiddle feature, and so forth. And so on.
"
FALSE,C+,Long John Silver,Jefferson Airplane,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7107,"
Easily the most coherent album to come from Airplane Associates since Volunteers--the music is muscular, the hole left by Marty Balin finally covered over. But the printed lyrics are catchier than the tunes. Grace sings like she's facing Mecca, and Paul sings like an automatic pilot. Which suggests that maybe a hole is still there.
"
FALSE,C+,Dragon Fly,Jefferson Starship,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7109,"
The key cut here is Grace Slick's gnomic ""Hyperdrive,"" in which supertechnology (spirit-powered, perhaps?) cuts through ""corners in time."" If in 1973 you'd been responsible for Baron von Tollbooth and the Chrome Nun (Jefferson Jitney), Thirty Seconds Over Winterland (dead live), and Bodacious D.F. (Marty's party), you'd want to think you'd turned a corner in 1974 yourself. But though this does achieve a slick modernization of their polyvocal sound (Barbata-powered, definitely), with Papa John Creach's fiddle and Craig Chaquico's guitar synthesizing past and future for purposes of metaphor and stage presentation as Marty Balin's cameo contribution links them audibly to their own history, it also proves that you can't get along forever on generalized imprecations against the powerful and invidious oriental-occidental comparisons.

FALSE,C+,Flight Log,Jefferson Starship,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7112,"
The truism is that their history matched the counterculture's from optimism to visions to anger to dissolution, and this compilation devotes more than a disc to phase four. I really tried to pin down some overarching theme I'd missed at the time, but dissolution seems to be it--not only did they have nothing to say, they didn't have much to say it with. The three Hot Tuna cuts sound fresh and intelligent by comparison, and the '60s stuff--only two repeats from Worst plus a live ""Somebody to Love""--is, well, optimistic and visionary and angry.

FALSE,C+,One Eyed-Jack,Garland Jeffreys,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7116,"
If this were a ""sellout"" it would be mottled with slavish attempts at a catchiness inimical to the reggaefied groove Jeffreys explores so deliberately. Take it as Product Due from an artist who for some reason hasn't written any of his best songs in the past year, and hope his muse returns.

FALSE,C+,Guts for Love,Garland Jeffreys,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5071,"
Jeffreys's odd weakness for rock without roll is the ruination of this overproduced, undercomposed anachronism--even the reggae grooves are tinged with synthesized AOR melodrama, and the dance numbers do not jump jump.
"
FALSE,C+,Aqualung,Jethro Tull,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7122,"
Ian Anderson is like the town free thinker. As long as you're stuck in the same town yourself, his inchoate cultural interests and skeptical views on religion and human behavior are refreshing, but meet up with him in the city and he can turn out to be a real bore. Of course, he can also turn out to be Bob Dylan--it all depends on whether he rejected provincial values out of a thirst for more or out of a reflexive (maybe even somatic) negativism. And on whether he was pretentious only because he didn't know any better.

FALSE,C+,Bleed American,Jimmy Eat World,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10323,"
Jimmy Eat World are who Blink-182 want to be when they grow up--even played B-182 frontman Tom DeLonge's wedding. Since JEW frontman Jim Adkins specializes in sensitive leaps and catches, this bodes well for DeLonge's visits to the marriage counselor, but it'll ruin his whine. Like most emo bands only at a higher level of tunecraft, JEW are so surprised to discover that punks become adults that they're impressed by feelings even a folksinger would know were banal. Their label hopes that pop fans won't care--that if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis.

I won't deny Buckwheat Zydeco's blunt punch or Boozoo Chavis's toothless charm. But tell me this squeezeboxing party animal ""invented the contemporary zydeco sound"" and I'm on the next bus to Biloxi. How do you play the guitar rhythms of ""Tighten Up"" on accordion? Approximately, but not so's anyone content with such clueless covers of ""Boogie Chillun"" and, Lord help us, ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" is oing to mind. I'll grant you ""Cisco Kid"" if you'll admit you have trouble remembering anything self-penned beyond ""Give Him Cornbread.""

As Joel's craft improves--I can recall four of these songs merely by glancing at titles--he becomes more obnoxious: the anti-idealism of ""Angry Young Man"" isn't any more appealing in tandem with the pseudoironic sybaritism of ""I've Loved These Days."" But I do catch myself in moments of identification with the three place-name songs on side one--""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" more than the overrated ""New York State of Mind.""

Dear Elton: If you're trying to claim it's all Bernie's fault, just hold on. One half of a songwriting team can always bail the other out of rock and roll as competent and (not counting that new sexist streak) unexcessive as this, as each of you proved on Honky Chateau. Maybe Bernie refuses to outgrow his pistol envy. But that's no reason for you to make the music not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper.

FALSE,C+,The One,Elton John,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5876,"
Fun automaton, floundering has-been, or unnoticed fixture, he hung in there, so that 1992 was the 23rd consecutive year he put a single in the top 40. Since Elvis himself only got to 22, this statistical aberration merits a tribute, and though I was disarmed by the news that he'd not only come out but was donating all singles royalties to AIDS research, I decided to take it as a long overdue hint to ignore his albums. Unfortunately, the first single was an all-too-well-plugged Eric Clapton feature. Then came an AIDS ballad drenched in midtempo melodrama, followed by a title tune that's just as soupy with less content. So here's hoping somebody at MCA likes ""Sweat It Out,"" a fast dance number about vanquishing the forces of reaction. Inspirational Verse That Saves Me a Review: ""No more Tears for Fears/Give me tears of rage.""

FALSE,C+,Heartbeat,Don Johnson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5086,"
Is the news that a competent singer has emulated his best buddies' music enough to get him on the cover of Rolling Stone? Formally, after all, it's the 1986 equivalent of a fifteen-minute extravaganza about Atlantis--bizzers at their most empty and self-congratulatory. What redeems it up to a point is Miami Vice's garish vision of El Lay rock as the epitome of high-rolling sleaze, hyping jaded emotions into some semblance of recognizability. And what does it in is Johnson's competence. Tina Turner can make such stuff signify, but Johnson, who rasps through his TV lines, goes clear when he sings. Isn't knowing Don Henley good for anything?

FALSE,C+,Shine On,George Jones,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5093,"
Charley Pride couldn't get away with the lucky songs Billy Sherrill's stuck George with this time, and though the unlucky songs are better, superstar guilt and second-convolution cheating just don't suit him. Granted, ""Ol' George Stopped Drinkin' Today"" is a near-perfect fit. But when it comes to ""Almost Persuaded,"" I'll take the original--by David Houston, Tammy's first singing partner.
"
FALSE,C+,Portfolio,Grace Jones,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7155,"
This disco queen sings flat enough to make Andrea True sound like Linda Ronstadt and Tom Verlaine like Art Garfunkel, which is nice--very liberated, very punky. But it's less than ironic that a woman who demands an end to jealousy--that is, who demands the same license to fuck around that male rock stars claim as their due--should (as a fashion model) occupy a similar power position. And while I prefer her version of ""Send in the Clowns"" to Judy Collins's, I'd just as soon she cover ""Pretty Vacant"" or something.

FALSE,C+,Used Guitars,Marti Jones,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2279,"
She satisfies that familiar hankering for self-expression, a disquiet known to any female interpreter worth her salt, by doing her lesser songwriting buddies some favors--at least their material will be identified solely with her.

FALSE,C+,"Oran ""Juice"" Jones","Oran ""Juice"" Jones",1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5105,"
Supposedly, this is the lowdown on love men: when his lady ventures off her pedestal, Juice drops the sensitive act and treats her like a gangster. And love him or hate him, he's about talking, not singing. I mean, personally I find his brand loyalties and ""y'unnerstand?""s kinda revolting, but he talks 'em like he walks 'em, so I can understand why hipper folks think they're hilarious parodies of the player's life and line. What I don't get is why any lady should be fooled by his sensitive act--he's got the falsetto to negotiate the second-rate Chi-Lites songs his raps are buried in, but not to put them across. Which makes the concept a cheat and the album a bore.
"
FALSE,C+,Pirates,Rickie Lee Jones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5107,"
Crossing Springsteen and Waits from a male-identified female point of view, Jones doesn't let on whether she's narrating or evoking. She slurs like a convinced lush. Her impressionistically structured, jazz-tinged studio arrangements are the El Lay equivalent of art-rock. In short, she writes and sings and composes as if she has something to hide. From herself, most likely.
"
FALSE,C+,Lost in Space,Jonzun Crew,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5110,"
I love ""Space Cowboy,"" in which hooks from Tom Tom Club and Clint Eastwood converge on the ghost of Gary Numan. Elsewhere, however, Numan's shade has all too much space to him/itself. Sure the cross-rhythms are niftier, and I know Bambaataa has given this kind of silliness his blessing. But not everybody can be blessed--or silly.

FALSE,C+,Janis Joplin,Janis Joplin,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7159,"
Because it captures such subtle yet essential virtues as intelligence, humor, and compassion as well as the big stuff she was famous for, film may have been Janis's real medium, and I recommend the documentary to which this double-LP is the putative soundtrack. But it ought to be seen and not heard--most of these cuts are available elsewhere, and the newly compiled early tapes are the rather tinny record of a singer who hasn't found her music or her band.

Between fun and the idea of fun falls the shadow--in a word, self-consciousness. Self-consciousness doesn't stop Fannypack, but these Danes aren't tuned-in enough for stereotype play. It didn't stop the B-52's, ditto, plus the Danes lack Fred, Cindy, Kate, and especially Ricky. If anything, their model is the much simpler and purer KC and the Sunshine Band, who upon direct comparison prove not so simple and hence purer. Pardon my poop. But I'm out of this party.

FALSE,C+,Blows Against the Empire,Paul Kantner/Jefferson Starship,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7165,"
Not counting friendly neighbors, there are only two changes from the usual Airplane lineup on this ""solo"" venture: Jerry Garcia replaces Jorma Kaukonen for reasons of interstellar propulsion, and Paul Kantner replaces Marty Balin for reasons of ego. As much Marty's ego as Paul's, probably--I wouldn't want my name on this thing either. Kantner's singing is as murky as his melodies (there's a connection there somewhere) and for all the record's sci-fi pretensions (does Philip K. Dick actually like this stuff?) it never even gets off the ground.

FALSE,C+,World Beat,Kaoma,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5123,"
I find it impossible to work up the fine pitch of loathing this piece of product arouses among the right-thinking. It's only a) hit-plus-filler and b) Europop, lame two ways by definition, which is no reason to listen to it but also no reason to be dismayed by its lameness; the lameness of the Brazilian dance-pop it rips off is more dismaying, because it's more misguided. In a time when Third World musicians dream of First World rich-and-famous, when Parisian sensibility deracinates the rhythms of the African diaspora one day and adds muscle to them the next, when France seeks to regain world cultural preeminence by embracing an essentially spurious multiracialism, lambada fits an inevitable market niche. It's Europop with a cafï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ au lait face and a bouncy bottom, and on the hit and the two cuts that follow it has the vulgar vitality"

As if he were Dick Griffey or somebody, admirers cite the radio appeal of this Brooklyn pheenom's smooth concoctions and recall the heroic deeds of Berry Gordy. Whether that rings true with you depends on whether you value the radio of the '80s as much as that of the '60s.

In a year when the big rappers have either repeated tired outrages or outgrown them, Kelly's crude, chartwise new jack swing is black pop's most depressing development. An effective singer in the post-Stevie new-soul mode whose way with a beat is confirmed by an impressive catalogue of bestselling productions, he aims his common denominator straight at the solar plexus. He has no apparent interest in tune--the Spinners' ""Sadie"" sounds positively angelic after ""Summer Bunnies"" and ""I Like the Crotch on You."" And despite a few moments of class consciousness, he displays far less human decency in his quest for booty than such unaltruistic competitors as Jodeci and Boyz II Men. But lest anyone suspect he lacks moral acuity, he offers this Inspirational Liner Note: ""To all those women out there when I step off in a club--don't treat me like I'm just anybody because you end up treating me like I'm nobody and that's wrong.""
"
FALSE,C+,At His Best,Eddie Kendricks,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7172,"
Rarely has a talented singer been so ill-served by his corporate connections without failing altogether. Kendricks doesn't have the depth of a natural solo performer--the sweet clarity of his falsetto rang nice spiritual overtones against his more earthbound fellow Temptations, but it gets thin all by itself--and he needs good material to compensate. This ain't it. Most of these songs were hits, but the two uptempo smashes, ""Keep On Truckin'"" and ""Boogie Down,"" are proto-disco at its most ominously one-dimensional, and except for the Tempts' ""Just My Imagination"" and the never-a-hit ""Skippin' Work Today,"" the rest range from passable (""He's a Friend"") to deplorable (""Shoeshine Boy"").

FALSE,C+,Life Is a Dance: The Remix Project,Chaka Khan,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5135,"
This peculiar compilation of newly commissioned remixes makes two artistic assumptions. First, that Chaka's voice and expressive reach render her the Aretha of the '80s. Second, that for various house-identified producers to fiddle with eleven of her solo titles is both an homage to and a reinterpretation of her oeuvre--even when, as does happen, her voice and expressive reach are reduced to icing and florets in the process. I accept neither. And I discern a commercial assumption underneath it all--here's a low-cost way to milk Chaka's cult.

The queen of world music isn't merely a big voice--she's also a compact body. Plus, terrific Afro-Parisian clothes sense. And to top it all off, a crew cut. In short (five-one, maybe five-two), she's a disco queen with a gimmick--earthier than Ya Kid K, maybe, but less grounded. And the follow-up doesn't even have ""Batonga""'s synth riff to jolly you past the guitar solos. (Well, actually it does--it just doesn't have another one.)

Initially this record sounds like a mechanical follow-up to Tapestry. Then you begin to notice the subtle musical advances and the ever more assured backup, especially from guitarists Danny Kootch and James Taylor and saxophonist Curtis Amy, and start humming ""Sweet Seasons"" or ""Song of Long Ago."" Then you realize it's really just a mechanical follow-up to Tapestry. I love Carole King, but her value is as limited as it is intense, and her lyrics are banal even when she doesn't write them.

For a long time I thought this was the worst rock band in history simply because it was the most pretentious, but sometimes pretensions are (at least partially) earned. Their second album is more muddled conceptually than In the Court of the Crimson King, quite a feat. But they're not afraid to be harsh, they command a range of styles, and their dynamics jolt rather than sledgehammer (properly electric, that). Also, they can play: kudos to drummer Michael Giles and guitarist Robert Fripp, who also illustrates the old adage, ""Better a Mellotron than real strings.""

Ray Davies is a sensitive artist, but he's never had an idea worth reducing to prose in his life.

Hook-laden and hard-rocking, this is the best-crafted Kinks album in over a decade, which means that for someone who's found Ray Davies's world-view increasingly mean-spirited and mush-brained, it's also the biggest turnoff. Back when he was chairing the Village Green Preservation Society, Ray's dotty lyricism put his nostalgia in appealing and appropriate musical perspective; his current clean-cut arena style makes him sound smug and strident, as well it should. Opening with a piece of radio pimpery in which a deejay becomes not just a benefactor (lie enough these days) but a hero of modern mythos, it moves on to songs about paranoids, battered wives, murderers, and dirty old men that reveal minimal charity for either side of the interactions they put down.

Success of the Vegas/television sort does more than pollute the sensibility--it diverts one's attention from the grubby business of making records. It took two production teams to turn out this arrant product, a sure sign she knows something's wrong. Strongest cut: the Pips' (and Eugene McDaniels's) ""Street Brother.""

FALSE,C+,The Ernie Kovacs Album,Ernie Kovacs,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11318,"
Kovacs could make me laugh very hard when he was alive, but that was 15 or 20 years ago, and like a lot of comedy his material doesn't age well, at least not for me. I mean, a lisping poet who complains to Brooth about his martini? (Compare Bob and Ray's ""Charles the Poet, on RCA's sadly deleted Golden Age of Comedy.) As with the TV revivals the record is not without laughs, but they come about once every five or 10 gags, wan little chuckles that feel forced even when they're involuntary.

FALSE,C+,Gorillas in the Mix,Bernie Krause & Human Remains,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5163,"
""Every sound on this record has been created from the voices of animals except as noted in the credits,"" claims the credits intro, which goes on to list six different keybmen and no other players. And sure enough, the coyotes, dolphins, whales, walruses, and (yes) turkeys who carry the electrofunky tunes all sound like synthesizers. Now is that sick or what? Hi-hat chores go to the snapping shrimp, kick drum to the ruffed grouse, and so forth, with the key copout ""from the voices,"" for rarely are the voices of animals heard on this disc; whenever a horse or crow or pig or otter is allowed an untreated interjection it comes as a moment of grace. You don't have to be an animal rightser to believe that only a hairless biped could conceive anything so cosmically cutesy.

FALSE,C+,Rock & Reel,La Bottine Souriante,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5220,"
Winking whenever the folk do something cute (or dirty), wearing an I [Heart] Jazz button on their collective sleeve, this accordion-fiddle-horns nonet epitomizes the cloying multicultural sophistication that infests ""world music."" I'd hoped they were French, but in fact they're Quï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½becois, which makes sense--the Breton-Celt connectio""fun"" fun. Bilbao's Kepa Junkera proves it's possible to keep eclecticism clean. This kind of stuff gives purism a good name.

FALSE,C+,Keep Smiling,Laid Back,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5339,"
The Danes in this duo are to disco what the Germans in Trio are to rock and roll--just as deliberately minimalist but, in the tradition of the genre, a lot smarmier. If you wanna be rich, scratch 'em where they itch.

FALSE,C+,Trouble,Ray Lamontagne,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13097,"
I admire LaMontagne, who's had nothing handed to him. But it bodes ill that the Stephen Stills album that moved him to quit his factory job was a '90s one. Just as we live in a world where some radio stations get on Stills's latest, we live in a world where some record buyers suck up folk-rock verities--to which LaMontagne adds nothing but a backstory. Since his admirers bring up Van Morrison, it is my duty to report that he lacks Morrison's voice, poetry, Gaelic soul, and r&amp;b feel--in other words, everything that once made Van worth bringing up. Nothing lasts forever, folk-rock included.

FALSE,C+,Shine,Daniel Lanois,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12203,"
Born September 19, 1951, Lanois has mortality on his mind, and ""I Love You"" nails it: ""Come sure, come soon, come leave just one song/One song, one beat, one dust, one end, one for all/One stone for the marking for the dream when it falls."" But this isn't literature, and since true fatalism requires a steely resolve that the failed humility and fake passivity of Lanois's gauzy sound don't comprehend, I pray somebody makes those lines worth hearing. Or no, not pray--there's enough of that in ""Shine,"" a hymn to Sol, and ""Falling at Your Feet,"" a hymn to God.

FALSE,C+,A Night to Remember,Cyndi Lauper,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5353,"
Can you believe she's talking this one up as a triumph of self-expression (meaning ""personal"" songs, like that Kodak ad) over spiritual adversity (meaning commercial shortfall)? How embarrassing to have placed hope in this woman. And how sad to compare the bold finds and off-the-wall vulgarity of the only good album she'll ever make to this bigtime pop--a parameter stretched not an iota by songs about one's very own breakup, not to mention strokes as prudently defiant as the lyric about not being a pet, which was probably Christina Amphlett's idea anyway.

FALSE,C+,Love More Than Pride,Laura Lee,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7264,"
The title of this belated but opportune package from Lee's old label says it all--in her previous incarnation, she was a not-quite-great voice without a gimmick, just like so many of her sisters. For some reason, two minor hits from 1967--""Wanted: Lover, No Experience Necessary"" and ""Up Tight Good Man""--aren't included. Might give it a little more flair. Might push it over thirty minutes, too.
"
FALSE,C+,Come On Feel,The Lemonheads,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5890,"
Evan Dando is a good-looking guy with more luck than talent and more talent than brains who conceals his narcissism beneath an unassuming suburban drawl. Twenty years ago he would have affected an acoustic guitar and acted sincere; now he affects a slacker-pop band and acts vulnerable. His songs don't bite, they sidle over and nibble your ear when you're not looking, and if you throw him a withering glance, no problem--he'll just move on to someone else. Exception: the one about drugs.

FALSE,C+,Mind Games,John Lennon,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7268,"
A step in the right direction, but only a step. It sounds like outtakes from Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, which may not seem so bad but means that Lennon is falling back on ideas that have lost their freshness for him. Still, the single works and I hope he keeps on stepping. Favorite Plastic Ono Band outtake: ""One Day (at a Time)."" Favorite Imagine outtake: ""You Are Here.""

FALSE,C+,Imagine: John Lennon: Music from the Original Motion Picture,John Lennon,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5365,"
Nothing wrong with the music, though you can do without the bait--""Imagine"" work tape, carefully hoarded new song work tape.

FALSE,C+,Diva,Annie Lennox,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5877,"
The honorable Timothy White avers, ""Her vocals have never felt performed,"" which those of us who don't commune regularly with the stars can take as a sign that the guy's been in show business too long. It's our belief that Ms. Lennox's vocals have never felt anything but performed--and that this palpably phony quality was her chief charm even though it meant that at her most nuevo wavo she was destined to turn conventional pop singer sooner or later. So here she goes normal, if that's what you call somebody who emotes banalities to her baby daughter loud enough to wake the disco: ""precious little angel . . . [percolating bass] . . . bundle full of love . . . drowned in my own tears . . . [cool trumpet solo] . . . gift from heaven . . ."" Thank your maker she fades it instead of going out on a high note.

Certainly not ""Nubian."" Biology not being destiny, not ""Cameroonian"" either. ""Princesses"" metaphorically if at all. Not ""Miriam Makeba meets Wyclef Jean"" or any half of same. ""Soul II Soul meets Zap Mama"" a smidgen. ""Sisters"" if they say so, ""soul"" if the ""5th Annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards"" says so. ""French"" definitely, ""hip-hop"" forget about it.

If only they'd had twenty-four-track consoles in the '60s, maybe Byrds albums would sound as great as their legend. And if only Mitch Easter had something to say, maybe Let's Active albums would sound as great as Byrds albums--although even Michael Clarke provided more forward motion than this.

If the blood were literally young, the Killer would now be the Vampire. Instead, producer-wunderaltekacker Andy Paley is the Ghoul. Jerry Lee can still rock the 88s, but his natural voice is a croak or a wheeze, as he proves by heroically holding ""Gotta Travel On""'s final ""long"" until it tails into the pitchless pit he's already filled with croaks and wheezes. He couldn't get away with ""Thirty-Nine and Holding"" at 45. Yet at 60 he still wishes he was 18 again.

This went number one in England--they're getting so stuck up over there they're even growing their own simpletons. The melodies throw a hook now and again, and the harmonies are tarter than CSNY's--that deep-seated modal tradition, y'know. But though they complain in ""City Song"" that ""your music""--by which they mean our music, fellow urbanites--""it doesn't speak, it swears,"" their own lyrics aren't worth mumbling.

Aphrodisiac they ain't--just Hispanic and, supposedly, fly. Hell's Kitchen scullions who've made good in typical one-part-talent-to-ten-parts-application Fame fashion, they're just streetsmart enough to want nothing so much as to escape to the suburbs.

Lisa got to sing ""I Wonder If I Take You Home"" because she sounded like the kind of amateur who might put words to the tune of yah-yah yah-yah-yah. At album length her musical comedy training comes to the fore. A Rosie &amp; the Originals for our more pretentious time.

FALSE,C+,Down on the Farm,Little Feat,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7286,"
Not a bad Doobie Brothers parody, but the harmonies were better last time and the laugh lines are in short supply. Might be funnier if they targeted the Doobies '79 rather than the Doobies '75.
"
FALSE,C+,The Rill Thing,Little Richard,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7287,"
Little Richard produced this alleged comeback in Muscle Shoals. He also wrote most of the songs, including the ""hit,"" ""Freedom Blues"" (""Tutti Frutti"" it ain't), and the title track, a slow ten-minute funk instrumental on which he doesn't even seem to play piano (very rill). I continue to value his singing. Best compositions: ""Lovesick Blues"" and ""I Saw Her Standing There.""
"
FALSE,C+,Voice of America,Little Steven,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5385,"
I deeply respect Steven Van Zandt's brave translation of rock and roll libertarianism into internationalist antiwar propaganda, and I don't think he's done badly by the songwriting--somebody cover ""Fear,"" or ""Justice,"" or ""Among the Believers."" But please, please, please don't make me listen to him sing them anymore. His voice is devoid of dynamic or dramatic zip. When he's not bellowing, he's plodding. And he's got a band to match.
"
FALSE,C+,Throwing Copper,Live,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5919,"
On stage, this intently mediocre young band is U2 without a guitar sound. On record, it's R.E.M. without songs. Fittingly, it generates the ""idealistic"" arena-rock U2 is no longer hungry enough to bother with and R.E.M never had the stomach to work up. Only with the old guys I wouldn't put the saving word in quotes.

FALSE,C+,Bigger and Deffer,L.L. Cool J,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5388,"
Like the pop-metal egotists he resembles every which way but white, J proves that there's something worse than a middle-class adolescent who's gotta be a big shot this instant--the same adolescent the instant he becomes a big shot. Overrated though it was, the debut had guts, spritz, musical integrity, and Rick Rubin. Breakthrough though it may be, the follow-up has a swelled head, a swollen dick, received beats, and quotes from Berry, Brown, and the Moonglows that confuse me. Could it be that the planet existed before he brought it to fruition?
"
FALSE,C+,Nils,Nils Lofgren,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7296,"
If Lofgren's early mini-Western, ""Rusty Gun,"" was the modestly laconic offering of an up-and-comer who remembered, then ""No Mercy,"" the boxing melodrama now getting airplay, is the rodomontade of a shoulda-been-a-contender. I bet cocomposer Lou Reed wrote the best line, but Nils sings it with indubitable bitterness: ""I thought you were being ironic when you ripped your jeans.""
"
FALSE,C+,Flip,Nils Lofgren,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5389,"
The wuntime wunderkind is ""talkin' 'bout survival,"" which he at least points out beats ""self denial,"" and I guess it's a small miracle that he's no longer the blustering never-was of the late '70s. But 1983's Wonderland testified more gracefully to his eternal youth, and even there it was hard to tell what he's learned since 1971. To seek eternal youth in the absence of temporal wisdom is one of the great American vices, and most Americans aren't even wise enough to know it.

FALSE,C+,Keep the Fire,Kenny Loggins,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7297,"
I used to think Kenny had no sense of rhythm, but his problems were actually less severe--he just couldn't rock. This Tom Dowd-produced Doobie-disco job swings just like Jesse Colin Young. And if you think it isn't Doobie-disco, tell me why the one great song on the record was written with Michael McDonald. ""This Is It,"" it's called, and it is.
"
FALSE,C+,Vox Humana,Kenny Loggins,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5390,"
""My goal was to transform my music into a more and more personal medium,"" says this harmless case study in contemporary pop of his first self-produced album, so he must think a lot about ""love,"" a word which appears in seven of the nine songs. The subject is all-important for sure, but tricky to make new, as they say. Loggins succeeded in 1979 with the put-up-or-shut-up epiphany ""This Is It."" Here he hopes his rhythmic savvy and supple falsetto prove epiphany enough for Contemporary Hits Radio. Which given the promotional budget and catchy arrangement of the confidently entitled title tune, they already have.

FALSE,C+,The Best of Friends,Loggins and Messina,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7298,"
I suppose this compilation deserves points for hummability and getting it over with--eight of the ten songs are from the first two albums, so it's about time--but there's just too much to forgive. The memory of K. clapping his hands like a seal while exhorting a Cheech &amp; Chong crowd to ""boogie."" The memory of FM programmers offering up ""You Mama Don't Dance"" as a tribute to the uptempo demons. The note that compares that song to ""Wilbur Harrison's version of `Kansas City'"" (it's Wilbert, you ignorami, and it sure ain't ""Kansas City""). And especially the note that connects the even limper ""My Music"" to ""the simplicity of the early Chuck Berry days."" The nerve. Chuck Berry had genius, energy, soul, spunk, wit, irreverence, brains, urgency, a good beat, a criminal record, a number-one record, brown skin, a pompadour, and a duckwalk. All they've got is a million dollars--or less, I hope.

""A cross between Jimi Hendrix and Ritchie Valens,"" guitarist Henry Garza suggested modestly last year, and strangely, the big problem isn't that Henry is no Stevie Ray Vaughan. It's that these three Chicano brothers lack the main thing the forever incomparable Hendrix and prematurely sainted Valens shared--youthful pizzazz. The Lonely Boys' dad, Ringo Sr. (Ringo Jr., make of it what you will, plays drums), has been touring them so long that by now they're old pros--assimilated, acculturated, attenuated. So the obvious comparison is also dead accurate: Los Lobos tamed.  You want something fancier, call them a cross between Santana and Air Supply.

With David Byrne and Arto Lindsay replaced by the Soho equivalent of studio musicians, Peter Gordon turns to self-consciously chickenshit disco/soundtrack mewzick, kitsch he posits as punk and/or no wave and/or minimalism's next convolution. No no no, ""posits"" is wrong, bring that back to ""parodies."" How about ""exploits""? Whatever, the important thing is that their friends think it's cool and people they meet at parties don't.

Wish I could work up the fine pitch of loathing this received, synthesized, male chauvinist pop metal theoretically deserves, but in fact it's not completely awful: ""Working for the Weekend"" articulates a real class dilemma, ""Get Lucky"" puns on the band's careerist fortunes, and ""Emotional"" is a better Stones rip than ""It's Only Rock 'n Roll.""

As a statement of principle, the title track is scary-good and creatively derivative; put into practice it's scary-stupid and oppressively ordinary. How do we get MPR? By play-acting bully-boy scenarios that sound petty enough to be from life and making up others we'd never have the guts for--one production number climaxes with, eek, a hand grenade! And by showing an endless profusion of imaginary bitches who the man is--the other production number climaxes when three gold-digging skeezers, as they were called in the good old days, end up with their blood all over the tracks.

Maybe the Allmans supported Bush too, though I bet not; maybe that fox Ronnie Van Zant would have turned into Charlie Daniels, though he would have nuanced it. But Daniels is Donald Fagen up against the backup-singer cheerleading and golden-oldies smarm of Johnny Van Zant, and where the Allmans replaced their mythic front line with Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, who jam at least as tight and hot, Gary Rossington didn't anchor that peachy a guitar section to begin with. A few of the post-Ronnie songs are surprisingly decent--""Red, White and Blue,"" for instance, is about Johnny's neck, hair, and collar. But you know what else it's about, and in case you don't he has four or five ways to rub it in, including thanks to God for the lovely Nashville night. Not Memphis, not Jacksonville--Nashville.

""You can take your change on down the road/And leave me here with mine,"" Johnny Van Zant begins one of the two songs that take up the title theme after has run through the pleasures of home, the perfidy of woman, and the mixed blessings of the music business for the umpteenth time. Like the wary younger sibling he's always been, Johnny will always hold onto a quarter and settle for what he knows, or thinks he does. Really, he ought to have some inkling that nobody worthy of his trepidation wants to ban hunting, burn the Bible, or slam old Uncle Sam, although actually that no smoking sign means exactly what it says. On the other hand, ""Unwrite That Song"" would make a nice B side for Darius Rucker.

The first soundtrack ever patterned after a field recording, this suite/montage/succession of hums, moans, claps, and plucked fragments, all keyed to Lightnin' Hopkins's gorgeous gospel blues ""Needed Time,"" is regarded by one trustworthy observer, Greil Marcus, as Taj's most eloquent music.

Things finally get going toward the end of side two with an insane Howlin' Wolf imitation and a calypso-blues trucking song complete with CB.

These minor early-'70s hits aren't what her admirers consider the best (that's coming out right now on Dot), but they do foreshadow her concept, in which she applies her limpid center and soft edges to such soul classics as ""Show Me"" and ""Do Right Woman"" and then sells them to the country audience--by upping the tempos, oddly enough. Hard to figure what's so innovative--didn't that Presley guy do something similar? And when he went to Vegas, he went on his own terms.

I approve of their Latin-funk concept and I'm struck by their name--a mandrill is one mother of a baboon, and what do you think a man drill might be? But their music has proven disappointingly tame. Even the big hit sequence on side one--""Fencewalk"" to ""Git It All"" to ""Hang Loose""--isn't exactly a rampage. Which is probably why the hits weren't go-rillas.

All I know is this poster girl for the DIY fallacy is still the ultimate NPR middlebrow, addressing disillusioned love songs to the biz the way Christians address illusioned ones to the Lord Jesus.

As this group moves closer to the jazzy style it no doubt covets, it begins to show the corners of its rhythmic box. As well as minimal self-knowledge--Mann's strength has always been song interpretation, after all.

Instead, his banned-in-Wal-Mart slipcase job will fade into the haze of records people found interesting at the time. Its strategy is to camouflage the feebleness of La Manson's vocal affect by pretending it's deliberate--one more depersonalizing production device with which to flatten willing cerebella whilst confronting humankind's alienation, amorality, and failure to have a good time on Saturday night. Catchiest songs: ""The Dope Show"" and ""I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)."" Duh.

Maybe she could sing the telephone book and make me like it, but compared to the telephone book, ""You make love like springtime and I can't control my passion/You make love like springtime even when love's not in fashion"" lacks serendipity--especially after five minutes, with seasonal changes for variety and a jazzy 3:20 reprise for excess measure.

Despite a few jarringly saccharine choral bits and some dumb screeching, this mostly instrumental enterprise by John Mayall grads Jon Mark and Johnny Almond is indeed relaxing--so relaxing people are getting excited about it. That's what happens when you confuse enlightenment with more mundane contemplative states. Miles Davis's In a Silent Way on the one hand and Booker T.'s Melting Pot on the other are just as pleasant and offer both thrills and substance underneath. This offers neither.

The first analogy is Alice Coltrane, who also trivializes a faith her husband brought miraculously and paradoxically alive with simple-minded music, but though it's just as well Rita doesn't play the harp, Merry Clayton and Patti Austin are more to the point: beware of backup singers' solo albums, no matter how surefire the single or committed the session men.

Major-label flunky that he was, Eno sold them out--one of their No New York tunes could be ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" told by an imbecile, signifying nothing. Arto Lindsay is more steadfast--at this Christmas 1978 session he reveals his eternal CBGB billmates as the skronk nightmare of DNA's dreams. The voices are mixed-back exclamations and yowls. The guitars are all sludge, bang, and buzz--no chords, no timing, no articulation, maybe an upsurge occasionally. The drummer's job is to destroy any rudiment of a beat. Noise won't get much purer than this--I don't think.

FALSE,C+,De-Loused in the Comatorium,The Mars Volta,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12204,"
The most unrepentantly prog band to break in years began when Puerto Rico-born guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Mexican American vocalist Cedric Bixler Zavala rejected At the Drive-In's post-hardcore strictures, with Rodriguez citing salsa as a crucial influence. But his guitar montunos aren't salsa any more than Jon Theodore's Haiti-inflected heavy-muscle drumming is vodun. Salsa requires a groove, which the old people know embodies the community to which each individual is subordinate--such as At the Drive-In's forward thrash, which subsumes the complex songforms and explosive guitar from which the Mars Volta audibly proceed. In the case of Rodriguez's phrases and noises, romantic individualism has its uses. But Bixler's highfalutin inanities--the imagined dreamlife of a suicidal artist, all clotted surrealism and Geddy Lee theatrics--need whatever subordination they can get.

This is the sort of record you buy out of duty and then never play, not because it's a comedy record but because it isn't funny out of context.

Led by matched admirers of Jimi Hendrix and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, anchored by a former Anita Baker road drummer, and spiced by a former Three O'Clock gittar man, their sorta-major sorta-debut is way too all-embracing at 17 songs and umpteen cross-genres, following their sorta-indie demo album and live EP into college-radio nowhere. I don't care whether they're progressive and postmodern and goofy and smarter than the person next to you (but not you). And I also don't care whether they can play their instruments. Because they can't play their influences.

The hit vies in rank sentimentality with ""Candle in the Wind,"" hooked to a male groan also unlike anything I've ever heard. Subject: dead homies, a hard reality turned soft metaphor. The rest is underproduced propaganda for, reflections of, or fantasies about thug life that hold intrinsic interest only for live homies and their wannabes.

The beats speed up without losing their deep post-Cali bump, especially on the nonstop ""Make Em Say Uhh #2."" The artiste camouflages his rapping by passing work to his brothers and collecting chits from Bone-Thugs and Snoop. Political analyses are essayed. So the brutally predictable solo smashes by said brothers, the cold Silkk the Shocker and the crude C-Murder, are less fun. But they're also less aggravating. In addition to givens about social services and law enforcement, we get ""Niggas don't kill niggas--media kill niggas,"" ""why the government don't protect superstars,"" ""no Grammy nominations,"" and complaints that his taxes are too high. We get all the usual misogynist ugliness and black-on-black crime. We get Snoop calling Puffy out without going so far as to utter his name. ""The ghetto's got me crazy"" I know--that's the cliche P patented with his groan. But ""too legit to quit""? Where have I heard that before?

Back when he was one more nothing bandleader riding a chart fluke, there was something likable about Rob Thomas--something common, something dork-gets-lucky. Carlos Santana changed that fast, and with this album well into its second year on the Billboard 200, Thomas is now officially a menace. He's always emoting some new excuse with his not-bad voice, and he looks like he spends a couple grand a month on haircuts alone--a neat cross between Michael McDonald and Gregg Allman who'll be doing duets for decades. Next chapter: the solo debut.

FALSE,C+,Matching Mole's Little Red Record,Matching Mole,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2309,"
On the band's debut LP, never released in the U.S., Robert Wyatt proved his right to transliterate the French machine molle with the quavery, exquisite ""O Caroline,"" then guided the mostly instrumental album through what sounded in turn like Mahavishnu with a sense of humor, gently chaotic musique concrete, and the folk-rock of inspired amateurs. But here, in another installment of that endless soup opera The Curse of the Art Rockers, he changes keyboard players. The villain's name is Dave McRae, and I grant you he's not as highfalutin as Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman--this is avant-garde fatuity, very modular and/or atmospheric. Guitarist Phil Miller tries his best with songs about God and the initiation of a lesbian virgin, and Wyatt plays mouth and drums. But both of them let McRae take the album away.

Popular groundswells do vary in discernment, as students of jogging, nail care salons, and tax limits know. Like his homeboy and forebear Bruce Hornsby, Matthews jams politely. His instrumentation invokes classical, jazz, and bluegrass niceties. And although one can understand the deep-seated impatience with agony-as-entertainment his renown reflects, he's as bland as a tofu sandwich.

FALSE,C+,"Some Days You Eat the Bear, and Some Days the Bear Eats You",Ian Matthews,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7368,"
This is Matthews's eighth album of the decade (fifth solo), and though people still tell me he's deserving, I think he epitomizes the homogeneity of the new (country-rock) schlock. If the proof of his acuity is his covers of such songs as ""Propinquity"" and ""Blue Blue Day"" and ""Da Doo Ron Ron"" and (on this LP) ""Ol' 55"" and ""Dirty Work"" and ""Do I Still Figure in Your Life"" and ""I Don't Wanna Talk About It,"" the proof of his soft edges is that the originals are always more idiosyncratic.

In which Ian Matthews splits from Fairport Convention, hires a (good) pedal steel player, and sings like an angel. As you know, angels keep their intelligence discreetly concealed--no one would suspect that the song that goes ""Alright, everything's alright"" bears the title ""A Commercial Proposition,"" or that the drip who begs ""Please Be My Friend"" is off his rocker. The sobbing overlaid on Steve Barlby's ""The Watch"" does hint openly at irony. But what can the man who wrote ""Colorado Springs Eternal"" know from irony?

FALSE,C+,Band on the Run,Paul McCartney,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2687,"
I originally underrated what many consider McCartney's definitive post-Beatles statement, but not as much as its admirers overrate it. Pop masterpiece? This? Sure it's a relief after the vagaries of Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway, and most of side one passes tunefully enough--""Let Me Roll It"" might be an answer to ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and ""Jet"" is indeed more ""fun"" than ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey."" But beyond those two the high points are the title track, about the oppression of rock musicians by cannabis-crazed bureaucrats, and the Afro-soul intro to ""Mamunia,"" appropriate from relatives of the Nigerian children who posed for the inner sleeve with Sah and helpmates.

Of the seven cuts this doesn't share with 1978's twelve-cut, fifty-four-minute Wings Greatest, only the lost 1972 B side ""C Moon"" and the 1983 M.

""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" is a major annoyance. I tolerated McCartney's crotchets with the Beatles because his mates balanced them out; I enjoyed them mildly on McCartney because their scale was so modest; I enjoy them actively on ""Monkberry Moon Delight"" because it rocks and on ""Smile Away"" because it's vulgar and funny. But though nothing else here approaches the willful rhythm shifts and above-it-all silliness of the single, most of the songs are so lightweight they float away even as Paulie layers them down with caprices. If you're going to be eccentric, for goodness sake don't be pretentious about it.

FALSE,C+,Way Back to Paradise,Audra McDonald,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5328,"
Compared to Streisand, Garland, and Callas, said to augur a New Era of Popular Song, this two-time Tony winner proudly situates her big range and Juilliard technique on the far side of the chasm now separating Broadway theater from American music. Aficionados may follow the (satiric?) logic of, for instance, the sudden high note that punctuates the Adam Guettel-William Makepeace Thackeray trifle ""A Tragic Story."" But we who prefer our singing speechlike will figure she's just showing off again, which given the songs is perfectly appropriate. Ignorant of groove, eschewing verse-chorus-bridge, orchestrated to suggest the demon jazz only insofar as 20th-century European composition mooched off it, these are not tunes playgoers will hum as they flag cabs on West 45th Street. They are the sterile spawn of Stephen Sondheim and Ned Rorem, and although they signify little when sundered from their paltry dramatic contexts, serious they remain--what few comic moments they countenance duck their heads as McDonald prepares for her next octave leap.

FALSE,C+,If That's What It Takes,Michael McDonald,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8243,"
On his solo bid the El Lay soul man sounds like he should leave his therapist, not his group. He's feeling so hard the sense of strain is constant, as if ordinary romantic travails are driving him to the edge of existential patience. Yet despite it all not one of these common-sense homilies has the common wisdom of ""This Is It"" or ""What a Fool Believes""--there's a smugness about his determination to go with the serially monogamous flow. And I sure hope the next single is ""Love Lies"" or ""No Such Luck""--I'm sick of the rest already.

FALSE,C+,It's Your Call,Reba McEntire,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5892,"
There's no point expecting scintillation--even her new best-of doesn't have more than two-three zingers on it. So what's most irksome about this dull, bland megahit is what it says about the new Nashville. Reba has her pride, and ""For Herself,"" written with two other women, remains an honorable female-autonomy vignette even after you forget the tune (a good thing, because the song hasn't ended yet). But genderwise she's about as adventurous as Clint Black or Alan Jackson--just right for a world where Wynonna Judd is a protofeminist heroine.

Unlike his wife Faith, McGraw committed no egregious sonic offenses on his way to the top of the country charts, and given the kneejerk disdain Middle America elicits from my bicoastal cohort, I'd as soon leave him alone. But in a nation polarized far more cynically and effectively by the ruling class than the shallowest alt ideologue could dream, he has to be called on his love song to a Lady Liberty whose America includes no urban places, on his imperialist assumption that Mexico is for runaway spouses ha ha, even on his domestic bedrock, as if that's as socially responsible as rugged individualism need be. And then there's the matter of ""Who Are They,"" which goes so far as to blame ""safe sex"" and the replacement of ""what the hell"" by ""what the heck"" (I swear) on the owners of this newspaper (honest, named as such), called ""funny boys"" when he means ""faggots"" because ""They"" so decree. Fuck that. I don't much like how David Schneiderman treats unions, but I'm here to tell Timbo that my boss is a better family man than any damn country roadhog. ""I wonder if They like to fight,"" muses Timbo on his way to finding out where ""They"" live. Me, I use my words. If any Nashville thug lays a hand on me, I'll sue him within 50 cents of his ignorant life.

A waste. Vocalist Parker, an underrated blues pro, and organist McGriff, who has a name as a soloist but is better off accompanying, should produce a more than passable record almost automatically. But not when they're burdened with strings, insipid soprano choruses, and hopelessly inappropriate material. Is a bluesman singing ""The Inner Light"" supposed to make contact--and money--in St. Albans? Sonny Lester--remember that name--produced.

If EPMD's surprise rise was a revelation, the unheralded progress of this Bay Area rapper up the black album chart is a story in the trades. With his stolid boasts, heavy beats, and circumspect samples, he sounds like D.M.C. gone solo, but he's also got a local base, some new jack steps, and a video. In short, he's a pro as in product--already.

Old enough to know that irony stales on the tongue and dogged enough to notice when the songs peter out before the album is over, I'm less disappointed than the post-graduate pre-adults who were so tickled by the meta-faux hedonism of the Wesleyan duo's debut. After all, this airy prog-psych self-indulgence is merely an elaboration of the back half of that debut--the half I tuned out then but appreciate some now, because, even as self-indulgent elaborations go, the follow-up's a doozy. Last time they pretended they wanted to be frothy, decadent pop-rock stars. This time, with their best new one by far a praisesong for Brian Eno, they reveal that in real life they're wiggy, woolgathering dilettantes. Once they test the depth of the woolgathering market we'll find out whether they wanted to be pop-rock stars more than they knew. Given the tendency of unrecouped production budgets to cut into the royalties generated by one's hedonism, it's probably a good thing Ben Goldwasser's girlfriend is studying dentistry. A more reliable income stream than modeling, you bet.

Who has this boy been listening to? Morrissey? Anita Baker? June Christie? Harry Connick Jr.? Whatever the sleazy details, his announced decision to hold off on the dance music till next time half-proves he doesn't know as much about stardom as he thinks, and the ruminations with which he proclaims his seriousness finish the job. As a public figure he's no Bono or Boy George--he's a good-looking, replaceable teenybop idol. So only teenyboppers, and not too damn many of those, are likely to care that he feels demeaned by false fame. It's as a musician that he's won respect, and not even a pop musician--a dance musician. Ironic, isn't it, that the danciest thing here is yoked to (and undercut by) his highly unoriginal thoughts on this matter? And though the McCartneyesque ""Heal the Pain"" sounds like a hit ballad, most of this cocktail music is no more interesting than the cipher who sings it so ""well."" I'm betting it doesn't move a quarter of Faith's units, which ought to enhance his appreciation of dance music pronto.

It's going too far to claim that she's taken on a corporate personality--a very unusual individual does definitely peek out through the curtain of groupthink that hides these songs from the singer and from us. But that individual seems to have taken on so many advisers because she's afraid of herself, and such fear is not attractive in an artist of Bette Midler's power.

From anybody else, the second live album in under four years would have me charging unfair trade practice. From Bette it has me begging for intros--which rarely forthcome on a concert-flick ""soundtrack"" that plays better on screen than turntable. Streisand's claque is right--she's a sloppy singer, which without the diversionary shtick of Live at Last sometimes matters. On anything she's perfected in the studio, for instance. Or when she expresses herself all over ""Stay With Me"" or ""Fire Down Below,"" good notions that suggest cabaret may be her musical calling after all. ""E Street Shuffle"" she can handle--maybe because it has a plot.

Figures that a major-label, major-management band expressly obsessed with nuclear holocaust and man's inhumanity to man should smell slightly progressive, which I do not use in the lefty sense.

Some doctrinaire new wavers see the rapid success of this Jacksonville sextet as a reactionary portent, but as an old Skynyrd fan I can't get upset. They do boogie better than, let's see here, Missouri, Bama, Crimson Tide, .38 Special, Wet Willie, Atlanta Rhythm Section, or (mercy sakes) the Charlie Daniels Band. Really, they sound pretty good. Only one thing missing: content.

FALSE,C+,John Michael Montgomery,John Michael Montgomery,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5923,"
Nashville belched up the usual candidates for ritual slaughter this year, but most of them just weren't worthy. From ten-gallon wimps like Clay Walker to Village People rejects like Tim McGraw, the hunk boom of the early '90s is already playing out, and though Clint Black could have been so much more, in fact he still shows flashes even if he did check in with a Christmas album. This guy is slipping from lower on the evolutionary ladder and higher up on the heap. He took album three double-platinum on a bare-faced, two-fisted imitation of Garth Brooks, whom he has the gall to cut with Hank Williams Jr. Garth is great in part because he'd never give a woman a 10 or cap a well-reported verse-and-chorus about the hard labor of divorced motherhood with a covertly resentful verse about how the little lady needs a man.

FALSE,C+,Return of the Moonglows,The Moonglows,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7459,"
On the one hand, this revival of the great '50s group is obviously a money-making scheme. On the other hand, ex-Moonglow and Motown producer Harvey Fuqua has done a serious updating job--strings, after all, are the correct studio equivalent of the group's smooth polyphonous style, and ""I Was Wrong"" fuses the two periods beautifully. But there were strings in the '50s, too, and it meant something for the Moonglows to replace them with voices. On both hands, I'd rather listen to the real stuff.

FALSE,C+,A Sense of Wonder,Van Morrison,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5497,"
By marrying r&amp;b usages to Celtic mysticism in an art that honors both and then some, Morrison proved there was more to r&amp;b than even Ray Charles had dreamed. But when inspiration fails him, he's left with uninspired art. At his most automatic, Charles still has r&amp;b.

FALSE,C+,Mott the Hoople,Mott the Hoople,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7466,"
Despite the hype, these guys strike me as an ordinary hard rock combo. Their sameyness is not disguised by the melange of influences on side one--early Kinks, Bob Dylan, Sir Douglas, Bob Dylan, Sonny Bono, Bob Dylan, and Bob Dylan--and on side two this melange is quickly boiled down to its medium: sloppy hard rock with heavy leanings, big on post-Kingsmen instrumentals.

Mould-Maimone-Fier are some kind of supersession, but they're no band, and between the cello and the acoustic guitar and the moderato and the lyric sheet that ought to have a little typeface note like at the end of a Borzoi book, I find myself disliking their record intensely. Until the raving finale, it's so respectable, so cautious, as if honest thought were a suitable substitute for wisdom, sarcasm, a good joke, or a suicide run for the next intro.

FALSE,C+,Mountain Climbing,Mountain,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7467,"
We all know they're the original Cremora--what this makes clearer is that they're Jack Bruce's third of the jar. On ""For Yasgur's Farm"" Felix Pappalardi emulates JB's self-dramatizing vocal propriety as well as his bass lines, but when Leslie West runs an acoustic guitar solo from raga to flamenco without ever touching the blues you know he's not doing an Eric Clapton tribute. Can't fit the humongous ""Mississippi Queen"" into this theory, but I can tell you who wrote ""Theme for an Imaginary Western"": Jack Bruce and Pete Brown.

FALSE,C+,The Best of Mountain,Mountain,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7469,"
Mountain Climbing is the only album of theirs I've ever enjoyed even momentarily. This selects all of its enjoyable tracks and adds relatively classy filler like ""Nantucket Sleighride"" (heavy-metal myth discovers America) and ""The Animal Trainer and the Toad"" (one of two songs on this record to mention Beethoven). So I guess it's better. But it's not that much better.
"
FALSE,C+,Iaora Tahiti,Mouse on Mars,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5924,"
It's a shuck to apply the postfelicitous prefix ""post"" to instrumental rock, which has been a nothing tradition for a long time. In 1995 as so often before, chops were laughable, compositional notions paltry, big concepts quickly exhausted, and from Pell Mell to Eno/Wobble to FSOL to four out of five ambient comps to two out of three dance comps, the records weren't just forgettable, they were inconsequential. That's not true of this German duo, who care far more about details than their obvious godfathers Kraftwerk and at least as much as their vocal labelmates Pram. They may be quiet, but they ain't ambient--as background music, they're pretty irritating. Unfortunately, they're irritating up front as well. There's plenty of variety, and a well-constructed multibeat fantasia called ""Saturday Night Worldcup Fieber"" tickles me every time. But all this occurs within an aural universe that has little use for the lefthand three quarters of the piano. Its philosophical roots are in the so-called space-age pop that will remain lounge-rock's legacy long after joke bands from Black Velvet Flag to Friends of Dean Martinez have moved on to prostitution or website design--the vague sound/approach now reified in a three-disc RCA exhumation, a reminder that nothing released under the auspices of a major label stays incredibly strange for long.

FALSE,C+,Working Wonders,Judy Mowatt,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5511,"
The positivity of reggae's most autonomous woman isn't rendered any more credible by her brightly idealistic delivery--sounds like she's leading the community sing at Camp Nyabinghi. Her genteel Rastafarianism partakes of the usual fundamentalist delusions--she ignores Babylonian propaganda about Ethiopia, and she's sufficiently protective of her wonder worker's masculinity to insist that unlike those other women she's ""not up to any tricks""--without the saving grace of fundamentalist conviction. If you're going to be unreasonable, you might as well get all possessed and transported about it.

Hooking up with Imagination's Swain &amp; Jolley for hologram soul that takes advantage of her giant voice as well as their cushiony electrodance, she gives off all the right signs, romantic victimization prominent among them. I don't believe a word, even though I know it could all be ""true."" Maybe an aura of artificiality is the point--do I take Leee Johns literally?
"
FALSE,C+,A Little Deeper,Ms. Dynamite,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12126,"
If all beats are created equal, then Niomi Daley's spare garage is as strong as Kimberley Jones's thick hip-hop. If flow is as flow does, then her earned plasticity is as fresh as Lauryn Hill's easy liquidity. If singing is basically a matter of sincerity, then her straitened cadences express as complexly as Erykah Badu's high-flying scats. If conscious is enough, then ""Tell me how many Africans died for the baguettes on your Rolex"" will educate as deep as ""Black like the perception of who on welfare."" But good music isn't the same thing as a catchy feature story, and this Mercury Prize winner has less flavor than a plate of mashed. She's biracial and the eldest of 10 children and manifestly good-hearted, and when she goes ragga on the way out I wish she hadn't been groomed for something bigger and blander. But she made her choice.

FALSE,C+,Waitress in a Donut Shop,Maria Muldaur,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7476,"
In which a new '50s nostalgia, beatnikism, is manipulated to exploit reasonable doubts and fears about sex-role redefinition. No woman hip (or even tasteful) enough to love Skip James has the right to pretend there's such a thing as an earth mother. And if the production last time was too safe, this is what it was guarding against--ecch-lectic cliches.

FALSE,C+,Soul's Core,Shawn Mullins,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5331,"
Sincerity was smug long before irony was, and while Mullins devoted a long, honorable folk-circuit career to reinventing the feeling before he stumbled on his very own ""Taxi""--six indie albums in the trunk of his car and he could still muse, ""I don't know what I've been lookin' for, maybe me""!--I figure he'd rather be called smug than dumb or, heaven knows, insincere. Pretty good at observing/concocting the kind of composite characters journalists get fired for, he's so wrought up about their humanity that he rarely captures their humor or grace. That would require establishing a distance from them, and while they may live with distance, poor souls, he can't countenance it in himself. He's like a one-night stand who feels constrained to tell you he loves you instead of making clear why he finds you attractive. Feels icky, right?
"
FALSE,C+,Street Lights,Elliott Murphy,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7480,"
This time I can't blame the production--if anything, Steve Katz's understated hard rock and adept background voices lend emotional weight to songs that would otherwise sound hopelessly immature. Murphy's voice has always been callow, but whereas two-and-a-half years ago he came across as a compassionate kid who reached out toward the world as a natural function of this self-discovery, now he sounds like an effete young man who strikes out at the world as a natural function of his self-involvement. The distinction is less than clear-cut, and perhaps too sharp to apply to an artist of such laudable moral ambition, but anyone who praises someone whose ""wounds are open for the sake of art"" (ugh! what a line!) has never heard the one about the heart and the sleeve.

FALSE,C+,Danny's Song,Anne Murray,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7485,"
Murray's kind of pop must flirt with blandness if it is to be seductive at all, and this time she Goes Too Far. Conventional material is a big problem--even the title tune has been defined elsewhere, and by Kenny Loggins. In fact, there are a couple of live tracks here that have been defined elsewhere by Murray herself.

FALSE,C+,Keep on Jumpin',Musique,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7491,"
Just to reassure anyone pinheaded enough to suspect that I've gone over to The Enemy, I thought I'd mention this disco cult item, one of those tragedies of amyl nitrite poisoning that so distress sympathetic observers like myself. To start with the worst, half the record is devoted to a stupefying pop melody yclept ""Summer Love"" for 6:17 on side one and ""Summer Love Theme"" for 8:00 on side two. By comparison, the serviceable dance mix of the title track shines, and the headliner would be brilliant in any company: 8:20 of spare polyrhythm that never stops jumpin' and might be mistaken for the Wild Magnolias in the age of mechanical reproduction (except that it's faster). The problem is the title, which not surprisingly dominates the lyric. I grant that (""Push, push"") ""In the Bush"" is a phrase that sticks in the mind, but so is ""sit on my face."" I can imagine dancing to either in the heat of the 8:20. But would we have anything to say over coffee the next morning?

FALSE,C+,Sexplosion,My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5862,"
Disco-porn lite for kids who have so much trouble figuring out kink isn't sinful that they flip to the jive about how it captures the truth of male-female dynamics, patriarchal oppression, human nature, or whatever else feels-good-do-it. It beats S'Express's Intercourse, which must have been named after the town in Pennsylvania, but if you crave the real shit, sample the Lords of Acid's Lust. These Chicagoans are betting you'll feel more comfortable with a fake. In the '90s, when artists start talking both-a-parody-and-a-celebration, it's 50-50 the concept they can't put their finger on is exploitation.

Why is this the artiest of En Why's numerous art-pop bands? Because in their fascination with plectral interaction they eschew what makes art-pop pop, or rather, ""pop""--toons. Inspirational Titles: ""Europe,"" ""State of the Art,"" ""AEIOU.""

Snazzy guitarist turned decent-enough synth guy, the Spirit of Bebop Deluxe comes up with more dance hooks than Dolby--more even than Duran, at least on this U.S. compilation. And sings like Bowie doing a Jon Anderson impression or vice versa.

FALSE,C+,In Concert,Rick Nelson,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7496,"
Reassuring to learn there are constants in this changing world--a dozen years ago, Nelson was an inspired fake, and he still is. At worst this is a tasteful country-rock album marred by a mildness typical of the style and one too many Dylan covers. ""Hello Mary Lou"" far outshines any of Rick's four originals, but ""Hello Mary Lou"" has always been a terrific song, and I'd go see this band in a club in Denver any time.

FALSE,C+,Poor Man's Paradise,Tracy Nelson/Mother Earth,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7499,"
Jack Lee's three songs include one about how California was too hectic for him, and the only tune better than that comes from Willie Dixon, a specialist in the blues music a band of more or less the same name once played.

FALSE,C+,Tougher Than Leather,Willie Nelson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5530,"
In the end, I don't know what the fuck this supposed concept album is trying to say, and if Nelson does he should continue to keep it to himself--something about murder and honor and other romantic clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s. But since he felt duty-bound to write the thing, it does of necessity include a number of those modern rarities, new Willie Nelson songs! Including two that somebody el""Nobody Slides, My Friend"" and the new-cowboy advisory ""Little Old-Fashioned Karma."" Plus, for (symbolic) life, a rousing new version of ""Beer Barrel Polka""!
"
FALSE,C+,Without a Song,Willie Nelson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5531,"
With music as subtle as Nelson's you wonder whether you're imagining things. Maybe we've just had it with his shtick--maybe a Martian couldn't tell the difference between this and Stardust. Then again, what do Martians know? Not only is Nelson choosing cornier material--self-serving schlock like the title song, awkward fripperies like ""A Dreamer's Holiday""--but the relaxed, let's-wing-it delicacy has simply disappeared. When he tries at all, he usually oversings, and he's finally hitting the wrong clinkers. If you don't believe me, compare this ""Autumn Leaves"" to Stardust's timeless ""September Song."" Or ask yourself whether Julio Iglesias doesn't sound right at home on ""As Time Goes By.""

FALSE,C+,Nevada Fighter,Mike Nesmith & the First National Band,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7506,"
This begins perfectly, with Nes fleeing the ""Grand Ennui"" (which I heard as ""Opry"" first time). And continues honorably with ""Propinquity (I've Just Begun to Care)"" (the Stone Poneys tribute). And then falls flat on its face with three vacant originals and a side of moderately well-chosen but extremely unnecessary covers. Nesmith just isn't a strong enough singer for such stuff--makes you think he got his gig through connections.

Newbury has somehow attracted the meaningfulness vote by patching bits of ""Dixie,"" ""All My Trials,"" and ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" into a new copyright called ""An American Trilogy,"" but don't worry, not everything here is so ponderous and thick with emotion. Not so ponderous, anyway--he's still mulling over that love affair, and he does get weepy about it. This is the new Nashville? Because his relationships break up in California?

At five million and counting, this isn't the rank offense its demographic tilt would lead you to expect--auteur Maurice Starr has positioned two exceedingly cute uptempo hits atop two overly balladic sides. Really, why shouldn't a black svengali mastermind the safe white r&amp;b ripoff for once? Funkier than the Osmonds or Milli Vanilli. As hip as New Edition.

FALSE,C+,Ys,Joanna Newsom,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13508,"
Original is one thing, worth doing another--and if only indie ideologues knew the difference. So much that is sprightly about the debut is subsumed here by ambition, to be kind, and privilege, to be brutally accurate. The through-composition does gain melodic grace over time but would mean little without the ministrations of Van Dyke Parks, whose fancy stuff requires simpler tunes than Newsom wishes to provide. And the libretto--ach Gott! Supposedly inspired by milestones in Newsom's life, these whimsical pastoral allegories reveal only that her taste for the antique is out of control. All those who gave this a rave should proceed directly to Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene or John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. The new Arcade Fire will only waste their time.

Nine great songs, three of them covers, including the previously unavailable ""Don't Mess With Cupid."" If I knew no other versions, I'd recommend these 1972 demos, but as it is Johnny sounds tame, doomed drummer Billy Murcia halting, Arthur out of tune (shocking!), and David perhaps halfway to the wit and assurance that brought this great band together.

Featuring the original lineup plus a tactful second bass and full of unavailable originals and covers, this live recording from their 1975 fling with Malcolm McLaren looks like a gem and sounds like shit. Literally: audio is maybe a notch above Velvets-at-Max's or Beatles-at-Star-Club, with David undermiked and the guitars buried behind Arthur &amp; Friend. What's more, the originals are all Syl's, highlighted by ""Teenage News,"" which he improved on his generally forgettable solo album four years later. For documentarians only.

FALSE,C+,Revelation,Joe Nichols,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12597,"
You have to hand it to jingoists Darryl Worley and Montgomery Gentry--they evince heart or hair. This bland, well-respected tastenik is neocon in neotrad clothing. Coding as cannily as Alice Cooper, he opines: ""There's nothing wrong with people singing about stuff they believe in, but to get up and give a political speech and give your political views and forget what we came to the show for, that's ridiculous."" As for hits bewailing Christ's disappearance from the classroom, that's just stuff he believes in. And the title tune, about sinners saved by a dream of the rapture, why, Waylon Jennings did it once. How tasteful do you want?
"
FALSE,C+,Why Should the Fire Die?,Nickel Creek,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13098,"
Of course they're still ""really"" ""newgrass,"" but mainly they're a prog-pop band accessorizing their chords with mountain sonics. One effuser goes so far as to claim ""a younger, better-scrubbed Dave Matthews Band minus the blowhardiness, a rootsier Ryan Cabrera,"" while a tradder fellow adduces Bill Evans and Debussy. For some of us, unfortunately, all those loose-lipped compliments are negatives--Kind of Blue aside, we don't even like Bill Evans. Nor would I advise any three prodigies to reduce a James Joyce story to 54 words and rather more notes. The young-prodigy-tries-to-love title tune is a winning exception, and ""Doubting Thomas"" intimates spiritual struggles that arouse one's curiosity. But like most schmoograssers they're committed to virtuosity for its own sake, and like most young musos they've been too focused on technique to learn much about how music interacts with life.

Folkies, I guess--front man Mojo on acoustic guitar, Skid on harp, washboard, etc. But with strange roots: the blues rant that leads off quotes both ""Road Runner"" and ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" as it rambles insanely from inspiration to inspiration. Mojo is definitely touched by something--he preaches like Jimmy Lee Swaggart in the devil's hands, gobbles mushrooms and sniffs turds, sleeps on your couch. But he also fucks your mama and your girlfriend from behind, solicits head from ""art fag hags,"" and for his last trick beats up some gal who must have had it coming. Some white boys just can't handle the blues.

FALSE,C+,Tragic Kingdom,No Doubt,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5939,"
Like any pop skyrocket, Gwen Stefani is video-driven, and so hebephrenic you know she unprotests too much. The production's as bizzy as the Ivy at lunchtime, too. But this act's real problem is ska. Since the dawn of two-tone there hasn't been a single band in the style--excluding the punk Rancid but including Madness and the Specials--that was as songful as its fun-besotted partisans claimed. When that hippity-hop beat is hyped up for postpunk consumption, its energy somehow precludes tune. Not that she could sing in the same shower as classic Cyndi Lauper anyway. But classic Belinda Carlisle is another story.
"
FALSE,C+,Return of Saturn,No Doubt,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2591,"
Gwen Stefani is forced to battle the perception that she's shallow because shallow is what she is. Like any human being, she has real feelings, but they run about as deep as her hair color and her commitment to ska, and wasn't it polite of me not to bring up her gift for the pithy phrase and the catchy tune? Occasionally her pushing-30 doubts about the single life are touching, like when she imagines Gavin Rossdale would make a good dad. But after five years, two producers, one Spin cover, and one lead review in Rolling Stone, the single Interscope sent her back to the salt mines for is the best thing on her automatic-platinum follow-up. So maybe marriage wouldn't be such a bad idea. No no no, not to Gavin--better she should land a really nice accountant. They have feelings too.

Nyro is one of those hypersensitive types--they're usually women, which says more about women's oppression than their gifts, though it pertains to both--who can't see the condition for the nuance. There's no denying she's unique--her jazzy pop-gospel synthesis is without precedent or facsimile. No denying that she's serious, either, and probably in a good way--dedicated to her vision and her craft rather than pompous or solemn. But for an unsolemn person she cracks very few jokes, and her way with words, like everything else about her, is self-consciously romantic. She was born 150 years too late. When she's on, her music can overtake you anyway, but there's no ""Wedding Bell Blues"" or ""Stoney End"" on this album--melodically, ""Up on the Roof"" dwarfs her every meander. The plus is on general principles.

FALSE,C+,Mother's Spiritual,Laura Nyro,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5562,"
Though for a long time Nyro's heartfelt commitment to solipsism blocked her access to the greater truth, the romantic generalizations of matrifocal ecofeminism prove as ideally suited to her moody style of gush as the pat improvisations of ""women's"" folk-jazz do to her once unique and still arresting swoops and changes. Now that she's not only a refugee from the city but a mom herself, she's created an album ""dedicated to the trees."" Of course, earth motherhood can be a bummer sometimes, so if she can get hold of ""a ship from space"" she'll take her leave of this ""world that cannot give."" Then we'll be sorry. Inspirational Footnote (to the line ""while hawks* destroy""): ""*This word is being used in its traditional sense of war consciousness and not in reference to the spirit of the soaring bird.""

Steadfast stylistically since ""Back Stabbers"" in 1972, Kenny Gamble's three-man mouthpiece ought to make an ideal best-of--if you dig Kenny Gamble. I regard him as a gifted pop demagogue--black capitalist masquerading as liberator. The oppressively patriarchal ""Family Reunion"" is the lead cut, setting the tone of a collection three of whose four sides are rendered unlistenable by Gamble's sermonizing and/or sentimentality. What's more, the O'Jays deserve him. Eddie Levert is the master of the soulful harangue, parading the trappings of emotional commitment with literally incredible showbiz chutzpah. When I happen to agree with what they're saying, or when an inoffensive lyric is attached to one of Leon Huff's greatest hooks, I like them fine.

Those who wish Afropop were more political should reflect on this avowed revolutionary's Fire in Soweto--first banned in South Africa, which is no feat, it then became the theme music for Liberia's Samuel K. Doe, who soon proved one of the continent's worst despots. And as with most protest pros, neither Okosuns's ""progressive"" music, rock-colored reggae plus ye olde indigenous rhythms, nor his ""progressive"" lyrics, which praise Jah and Jesus and ye olde African woman, have gained passion or precision with the years.

FALSE,C+,Tubular Bells,Mike Oldfield,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7561,"
A musician with the technique and formal imagination of Terry Riley or Philip Glass can create electronic keyboard meditations worthy of hokey adjectives like ""mysterious"" or ""majestic."" The best I can come up with here is ""pleasant"" and ""catchy."" Oldfield isn't Richard Strauss or even Leonard Cohen--this is a soundtrack because that's the level at which he operates.

""Why are you sad?"" inquired the alt-rock mag. ""I dunno,"" replied the former child actor d/b/a Palace and such. ""I guess I was born."" Admired for his reticence, sexual ambivalence, and general refusal of formal commitment, I mean closure, Oldham lacks neither talent nor originality, and up against some truly lousy competition this is his most melodic record. But to declare him a new avatar of Appalachian purity is absurd, not just because he's a rich city kid who can't sing, but because his purity is a candid affectation--a standard variation on late alt's agoraphobic cultivation of ineptitude as a token of spiritual superiority. Why is he sad? Because sad is easier than happy--almost comforting, in a chickenshit way.

What the Geto Boys were to the insanity defense, Onyx are to the irony defense. Not that they'd cop to it themselves. They're not honest enough, for one thing. And they're also not smart enough, which doesn't mean they're as dumb as they pretend to be--or dumb in the way they pretend to be, either. The official line is that nobody takes them seriously, or literally, or something--that not only are they obviously not nigga-killing, whitey-robbing, pussy-stretching bad guys, they obviously aren't pretending to be. Instead, if you're still with me, they pretend to pretend, greatly amusing those in the know with the old nigga-in-your-nightmare routine. So for me I guess they're something like Frederick Barthelme. Vulgar fellow that I am, I still prefer my jokes boffo.

In case you're interested, this band is mucho hot among Eastern rock cognoscenti (read, know-it-alls). Very pleasant, too, although John Hall doesn't sing as tasty as he plays. The only impressive song is ""Half Moon."" Anything Janis Joplin used to sing is impressive, so that may not mean much.

What a waste. With a bigger boost from his hustler-bandleader dad, who started recording Johnny Jr. at 17 and got Al Kooper to produce the lad's first album, this genius in disguise might have become a very successful studio guitarist. You get to keep meeting the stars, and if you're biz-savvy, ad work eventually provides a reliable income stream. Instead Shug merely created what experts from the High Llamas all the way to Tortoise agree was ""almost like a new style of music that could have developed but never did."" Given his vocal inferiority to AWB, Hall &amp; Oates, and the Brothers Johnson, this presumably refers to the funk-lite fusion experts from the High Llamas all the way to Tortoise have taken it upon themselves to defunkify, with cultural consequences not yet detectable.

I loved the title cut, too--on the radio--but this is not, as I had hoped, the auspicious debut of a new soul talent. Invictus is the Holland-Dozier-Holland label that represents their breakaway (as producers) from Motown, but this album represents no breakthrough.

Gone is the jazz feeling Danny Thompson and Terry Cox can insinuate so cunningly, not to mention the American songs, and I prefer ""In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida"" to the eighteen-minute ""Jack Orion,"" about a noble fiddler betrayed by his serving lad. Don't they realize that every verse of ""Cruel Sister"" used to end ""Fa la la la la la la la la la"" because in the olde days people had nothing else to do at night?

Young Blue Suede's Original Golden Hits is still in catalogue on Sun, and (for completeness freaks) his entire Sun output is available on three Charly imports.

Does he whine them in that weird, self-pitying child-drawl? Sure, he regresses every time out.

Anybody who thinks Jamaican music is all ganja and so-Jah-seh should check out this not-bad collection of soul remakes, produced by Kingston's answer to Herb Alpert, Byron Lee (whose own American LP, Disco Reggae, includes a slinky version of ""Shaving Cream""), and showcasing an accomplished duo of long popularity. Not bad, like I say, but nothing to make you jot down WLIB's Caribbean hours on the door of your refrigerator.

With their damn newsletter at 80,000 and counting, the growth of their economic base is impervious not just to criticism but to any eventuality that doesn't involve the breakdown of the American transportation system. So give 'em 10 years, and don't worry you'll miss something in the meantime. Phish isn't a classic two-guitar jamming band like the Allmans or those guys from Marin. It's a keyb-guitar-bass-drums quartet, its music dominated conceptually by the high-cholesterol chords and florid arpeggios of Page McConnell's piano. Occasionally there's a good song--naif that I am, I like the one called ""Simple."" But they've never put more than a couple on one studio album, and this two-hour live double is where they show off their base-building specialties, e.g. ""a mind-blowing 35-minute version of `Tweezer'""--which is actually only 31, praise God, and guess what else they got wrong?

Pickett's variation on the New Pretentiousness in Black Music is to progress beyond simple horn riffs into the busy little world of producers Brad Shapiro and Dave Crawford. As an idea, it's better than most--Duke Ellington did a lot with something similar--but in practice it's just about unlistenable. The nadir is ""Don't Knock My Love--Pt. 2,"" a fantasia for brass on which Pickett doesn't sing at all. But Wade Marcus's strings can make anything worse, and Pickett sounds as desperate when his interpretations are spiritless as when they're frantic. Best cut: a cover of Free's ""Fire and Water."" Hmm.

Though I wish this rewarded close listening like John Williams, Fripp &amp; Eno, or the Archies, it's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it--tends to add both literary and political resonance. With this band, aural resonance is a given.

Feature: ""The lonely, ever uncool, always corny piano man."" Bio: ""Liam Hayes's new record is not just about pop, it IS pop in the classic (circa 1973) sense of the term."" Wha? Has Chicago moved to another planet? (Again?) Hayes's closest relative by far is Palace Inc. CEO Will Oldham whittling mountain music down to a doleful whisper. If he's anything, and his aesthetic is so attenuated you have to wonder, he's cool, and if his aesthetic is about anything it's about being about. Hayes's snaillike, lachrymose presongs resemble no pop in history, much less 1973. (1973?) And while it's possible to imagine a piano man this anonymously self-absorbed, no cocktail lounge would permit him to sing--unless he owned it, I guess.

The most overrated underrated group in America. All of CSNY's preciosity with none of the inspiration, all of bluegrass's ramifications with none of its roots.

In the great tradition of Uncle Lou, here's a live quickie for you--four songs from the two recent RCA albums, plus a classic or two from each hard-to-find Elektra, plus the collectors' single ""I Got a Right."" You get to hear ""Lust for Life"" without the laff-a-line chorus. ""Funtime"" with anti-Semitic flourishes, and lots of irrelevant bombast and concert-hall echo.

Problem's not Bernard Edwards's textures or Tony Thompson's pulse. It's not the condescending concept that united them with young posers John and Andy Taylor.

Problem's old poser Robert Palmer, whom the Taylors thought a suitable Simon Le Bon substitute. Ask any Duranie: he's got wrinkles, and they're not as cute as Bruce's.

His seventh album (three admittedly reissues) and third live LP of 1970 leans toward uptempo countryish ballads rather than the usual pop-rock eclecticism and proves that he can remember the words without cue cards. I know that's the way it is--but is it the way it has to be?

The Fat Boys have had a reggae hit. So have the Bellamy Brothers. So why not a pop-funk hit for a black Brit liteweight? Catchy on jezebels and dull on world peace, he tries to shore up the formula with subtle touches rather than simple conviction, and back in Kingston, oldtime bizzers from Byron Lee to Edwin Seaga are smiling.

A Salty Dog had Matthew Fisher putting his two pence in, not that I've ever missed an organist before. And on A Salty Dog the Robin Trower blues was country and droll rather than technological and macho. And on A Salty Dog they didn't print the lyrics, which ought to end those silly rumors about Gary Brooker's intellectual attainments.

Because this was unmistakably the P-Furs and unmistakably a stone bore, I figured we must have overrated this band. No one ever accused them of having the funk, after all. Comparison with Talk Talk Talk and even Forever Now soon set me straight, however. Before slipping into chronic depression, Richard Butler intoned amid chaos--the dissonant drones that here parade by in formation detonate all over the earlier records, which makes most of the difference. And although this isn't as lugubrious as you first fear, speed also matters. Usually folks who quit drinking stop sounding sorry for themselves afterwards.

The howls of outrage greeting this album come from smart optimists who just realized they'd been had. In fact it's no more cynical than The Flowers of Romance, and since it does maintain a groove as well as glinting sardonically on occasion, it's also more fun to listen to. But that's not to say it's fun to listen to. Where Second Edition throbs and The Flowers of Romance thuds, this shrieks, with some of history's ugliest and most useless horn parts--including the one that ruins ""This Is Not a Love Song""--leading the way.

Johnny's gotten so tired and cynical he can't cut to anywhere new: no matter how hard he tries (and as a working professional he does try), he's stuck with his own ideas. Stephen Hague is a tabula rasa--when he does the Pet Shop Boys he seems smart, when he does Spigue Spigue Sputnik he seems false, when he does Erasure he seems blank. So when he does PIL he seems blank with a few harsh cross-rhythms. And if you consider it corny of me to pick on Johnny's electrodance record, let me observe that if he'd gone to Iggy Pop or George Clinton things would be just as bad. Maybe worse.

Nobody who didn't want money from him ever said he could rap, but he did have a spirit and a community, both now gone-one because it's harder to stay human on top than to act human getting there, the other because anointing Biggie your coproducer doesn't make him any less gone. Wallowing in otiose thug fantasies and bathetic hater-hating, hiring big names who collect their checks and go, he is indeed hateful if not altogether devoid of musical ideas. And for inducing a cute-sounding little-sounding girl to pronounce the words ""hit-makin', money-havin', motherfuckin' pimp"" he should be taken to family court.

For all his disco suck-ups and rock samples, this Houston rapper has gone nowhere, which I'm afraid reflects inept promotion or raw regional prejudice rather than the political consciousness of the market. His handle I tolerate--up against the but-then-you'll-get-caught glamourizations of an Ice-T, anticrime outside the law has its ethical attractions in a time of unpoliced drug war. But even in rap his contempt for women is something special--whether freak or whore or crackhead, the human detritus he means to blow away is almost always female. And first, if she's lucky, he will test his theories of natural lubrication, summed up in a rhyme whose accidental acuity shouldn't get lost in the cutout bins: ""I got the tool that she needs/To make her insides bleed.""

I guess what's supposed to make the psychedelic revival cool is that it's postpunk; secondhand purism like this suggests that in our negative age it's a positive statement to replicate the wimpy singing, wispy tunes, unsure drumming, repetitive guitar effects, and naive world view of, oh, Kaleidoscope, Morning Glory, Aum.

Sometimes selling out takes courage, and it's heartening in a way that Raitt, who's hardly immune to moldy fig, is willing to adapt her blues-rock to hookarama convention.

Not only that, I'm down with the right schmaltz, like the profoundly shameless ""Skin (Sarabeth),"" in which two cancer kids bald from chemo go to the prom together--a milestone, I'm not being ironic, if you're wincing you're probably a bad person. But that one tells a story, and stories aren't how they roll. Their specialty is advice and reflection hired out to professional homilizers--""My Wish,"" ""Stand,"" ""Bless the Broken Road."" These pep talks are anchored geographically by a track Jay DeMarcus and Gary LeVox, the two big-city cousins from Ohio, hand off to genuine small-town boy Joe Don Rooney, who longs for the good old certainties of a little place called, what a startling coincidence, Mayberry, no R.F.D. required--in a song that doesn't mention television once. As for hooks, well, check the Tom Cochrane cover. Arena rock didn't die, it just moved to Music City. You knew that. But Rascal Flatts knew it first.

FALSE,C+,Peaceful World,The Rascals,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7592,"
I was impressed at first by the effortlessness of Felix Cavaliere's evolution from white punk r&amp;b to white cosmic jazz. Only the Beach Boys have changed so much with so little apparent strain. Yet in the end the jazz musicians he's signed on--Fathead Newman, Joe Farrell, Pepper Adams, Ron Carter--aren't especially well-suited to popularize Coltrane and Pharoah and Sun Ra. And even if Felix were singing enough, he wouldn't be singing very good stuff--composition has never been his strength, and lately he's been thinking about other things.
"
FALSE,C+,Raspberries,The Raspberries,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7594,"
A clever label on the shrink-wrap smells the way people who make stickum labels think raspberries should smell, and the clever music inside sounds the way people who make stickum music think the Raspberries should sound--that is, the way people who go to music school think the Beatles should have sounded, with rough edges elided and lots of Chopinesque white-album flourishes. Worse still, the conservatory-trained goo lovers are apparently the Raspberries themselves. ""Go All the Way"" does so, and better pop-tight than country-tight, but not that much better.
"
FALSE,C+,Long Time Coming,Ready for the World,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8256,"
How long, oh Lord, how long? An official 47:28, which comes (as they say) to 4:45 per cut, almost every one a slow if not sluggish grind. And with ""Mary Goes Round"" insisting that sluts need not apply, 6:29 of ""Love You Down"" is all a good girl needs.
"
FALSE,C+,Mother's Milk,Red Hot Chili Peppers,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5810,"
Punks who loved Hendrix and P-Funk way way back, they're finally cashing in on their good taste, and though unbelievers dis their sincerity, execution's the problem. They didn't have the chops to bring it off then, and by pushing the guitar up front they sound even cruder now. But they're perfectly nice fellas, really--mention ""compassion"" in the very first verse.
"
FALSE,C+,The Ear of the Behearer,Dewey Redman,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15195,"
I tried, as promised, but except for brief snatches, many of which caught me in attitudes passive enough to approach the comatose, this has that fatal new-thing sound: noise aspiring to be music. Don't get me wrong--that may not be what it is. But it is what it sounds like.
"
FALSE,C+,Cookin',Jerry Reed,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11251,"
Since I am no country expert, this umpteenth lp by a Chet Atkins regular took me by surprise merely because I'd never heard of him. Competent-plus in the country rock mold of Carl Perkins/Bob Luman/Charlie Rich. Docked a notch for time: 28.58.
"
FALSE,C+,I Ain't from Chicago,Jimmy Reed,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7619,"
At his best--on Vee-Jay in the '50s--Reed sang with the languid self-assurance of a man who never ran for the bus because he wanted to spend the fare on a glass of wine, and the unindustrious shuffle rhythms of the Vee-Jay band ambled right along behind. Great stuff. Evidence: The Ultimate Jimmy Reed, a new Bluesway collection of his best Vee-Jay performances that sounds crisper than the competitive Buddah pressing of several years ago. This more recent material, however, is busied up with Motown bass lines and soul drumming obviously provided by upstarts who believed they could do better than back this codger. A few cuts avoid the problem, but the material is spotty anyway.
"
FALSE,C+,Metal Machine Music,Lou Reed,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2144,"
Lou's answer to Environments has certainly raised consciousness in both the journalistic and business communities. Though it is a blatant rip-off, it is not--philistine cavils to the contrary--totally unlistenable. But for white noise I'll still take ""Sister Ray.""
"
FALSE,C+,Lou Reed Live: Take No Prisoners,Lou Reed,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7622,"
Partly because your humble servant is attacked by name (along with John Rockwell) on what is essentially a comedy record, a few colleagues have rushed in with Don Rickles analogies, but that's not fair. Lenny Bruce is the obvious influence. Me, I don't play my greatest comedy albums, not even the real Lenny Bruce ones, as much as I do Rock n Roll Animal. I've heard Lou do two very different concerts during his Arista period that I'd love to check out again--Palladium November '76 and Bottom Line May '77. I'm sorry this isn't either. And I thank Lou for pronouncing my name right.
"
FALSE,C+,Martha Reeves,Martha Reeves,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7623,"
This attempted masterpiece doesn't make it because Richard Perry has failed the fundamental test of the interpretive producer--matching performer and material. To an extent, this is Reeves's fault--her gorgeous voice has trouble gripping complicated ideas. But it's also true that the competition for undiscovered song gems has stiffened since the early days of Cocker and Three Dog Night, so that even a prospector as wily as Perry hopes to dig one out of a slag heap like Vini Poncia. The strongest cuts here (""Wild Nights,"" ""Imagination"") have bene recorded definitively elsewhere. Which makes this the modern, big-budget equivalent of a second-rate Motown album.
"
FALSE,C+,Dead Letter Office,R.E.M.,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2919,"
Peter Buck describes these B sides and outtakes as ""a junkshop."" Dumpster would be more like it. You can throw away a Velvets cover or three without anybody getting hurt, but bad Pylon gives unsuspecting young people the wrong idea.
"
FALSE,C+,Lionel Richie,Lionel Richie,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8282,"
At least Jeffrey Osborne wants to sing like Peabo Bryson or somebody; no sooner does Richie split off from his unnecessarily successful funk group than he starts making like Andy Williams. Not that this comes as a surprise to those who know the funk group. But there are better ways to integrate this great nation of ours.
"
FALSE,C+,Sittin' on Top of the World,LeAnn Rimes,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8723,"
Not content to split the difference between Patsy Cline and Debbie Boone, this young teen and her in-it-to-win-it voice turn as grotesque as a mascaraed five-year-old in a beauty pageant. She begins by imagining a guy who ""worships my body."" Her Dad Rimes production and Carole Bayer Warren crossovers reveal Mutt Lange as the easygoing popster he is. She never cracks a smile, rarely revs a tempo. And in the only climax she understands, she colors in the ""Purple Rain"" so dark I'd say its purple was black if that metaphor weren't patently ridiculous.
"
FALSE,C+,Robbie Robertson,Robbie Robertson,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8290,"
Once established as an icon of quality, he always took himself too seriously, and age has neither mellowed him nor wised him up. So now, casting about for a contemporary context, he hooks up with the two most sententious young artists of quality on the charts. Took some guts for such an unrepentant Americana-monger to risk Anglophobe wrath, but unfortunately, the mesh didn't take. Because whatever you think of Peter Gabriel and Bono Vox, you have to admit that unlike the old man they're a) idealistic, b) singers, and c) at no loss for context.
"
FALSE,C+,Pure Smokey,Smokey Robinson,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15196,"
This includes the most audacious and appropriate song Smokey has written in years, ""Virgin Man,"" but otherwise it is better-than-average undistinguished, and like any other mortal he would be well-advised to get it together.
"
FALSE,C+,Flying High Together,Smokey Robinson & the Miracles,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7646,"
A dutiful, pleasant, and very mild close-out--I enjoy ""With Your Love Came,"" for instance, mostly because it starts out like ""Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever."" Easy to imagine better versions of the nice enough Ashford-Simpson and Wonder-Wright songs, and the champ adds only a Johnny Bristol piano riff to hits by up-and-coming falsettos Record, Thompkins, and Jackson.
"
FALSE,C+,The Greatest Hits of Johnny Rodriguez,Johnny Rodriguez,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7653,"
Fourteen big ones from the one-time goatnapper and Chicano Charley Pride, only don't get your hopes up--he doesn't have Charley's big voice (or Freddy's big soul, either). He does sound very country, clear and nasal, but I bet he's more grateful for his good looks and would be happy to turn into the Chicano Engelbert Humperdinck if the Chicano Tom Jones were beyond his means. And doubt that Humperdinck's within his means either.
"
FALSE,C+,Made in the Shade,The Rolling Stones,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7658,"
Six tracks from two of the greatest albums of the decade and four from two of the more dubious ones. Not the four best, either.
"
FALSE,C+,Love You Live,The Rolling Stones,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7660,"
As a Stones loyalist, I am distressed to report that this documents the Stones' suspected deterioration as a live band, a deterioration epitomized by the accelerating affectation of Mick's vocals. Once his slurs teased, made jokes, held out double meanings; now his refusal to pronounce final dentals--the ""good"" and ""should"" of ""Brown Sugar,"" for example--convey bored, arrogant laziness, as if he can't be bothered hoisting his tongue to the roof of his mouth. His ""oo-oo-oo""s and ""awri-i""s are self-parody without humor. This is clearly a professional entertainer doing a job that just doesn't get him off the way it once did, a job that gets harder every time out.
"
FALSE,C+,Sucking in the Seventies,The Rolling Stones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8304,"
C'mon fellas, it's not that bad--you didn't really suck in the '70s. Made a number of, er, classic albums, in fact. Sucking them dry for this hodgepodge is what sucks. As I'm sure you know as your lackeys laugh all the way to your Bahamian tax shelters.
"
FALSE,C+,Undercover,The Rolling Stones,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8306,"
What do people hear in this murky, overblown, incoherent piece of shit? True, they still slip naturally into the kind of vernacular specificity other bands strive for; despite the wind-tunnel mix Keith still sounds like the incorrigible genius-by-accident he is, nothing stops Charlie, and Mick's Texas chainsaw monologue is a scream. Also, two of the songs have political themes, which I guess is supposed to fill me with gratitude. But I'm such a churl I'm only grateful for good songs, and these are as tired and witless and nasty as the rest. Their worst studio album.
"
FALSE,C+,Don't Cry Now,Linda Ronstadt,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7664,"
In which whatever was raunchy and country about her is laundered in David Geffen's homogenizing machine, manned this time by John David Souther, who must have told her that ""Sail Away"" was just another pretty song. You think she's gotten so used to playing the dumb chick that she's turned into one?
"
FALSE,C+,Get Closer,Linda Ronstadt,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12067,"
Could be her, could be us, probably's both, but never has Ronstadt sounded more the art singer than on this painfully precise collection. James Taylor, of all people, saves the Ike &amp; Tina cover, and Rod Taylor, of all people, adds one more great ballad to her canon, but I suggest that she git while the gitting's good.
"
FALSE,C+,The Best of Rose Royce,Rose Royce,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8311,"
If Norman Whitfield had been content to concoct a disco trademark, they could have been greater than, I don't know, the Undisputed Truth. Instead he fed them, you know, ballads, exactly one of which is good enough for, let's say, Jennifer Holliday at the Holiday Inn. Leaving three nice dance grooves and the eternal ""Car Wash.""
"
FALSE,C+,Diana Ross,Diana Ross,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7674,"
The sound of young America grows older, replacing momentum with progress and exuberance with nuanced cool. Producers Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson provide all but one of the songs--they've written a couple of great ones for Marvin &amp; Tammi in the past. Unfortunately, the same couple (of songs) provide two of the three high spots here. And there ain't no high spot high enough. (Catalogue number: S-711.)
"
FALSE,C+,Everything Is Everything,Diana Ross,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7675,"
If I'm not mistaken (and let's face it, that's possible) this is an answer record to Aretha's This Girl's in Love With You. A little heavier on the corporate consultants, granted, but she does cover Aretha's own ""Call Me"" as well as several Beatles numbers and Bacharach-David's Carpenters (instead of Herb Alpert) hit. Blame its inferiority on the inferiority of her corporate consultants--and on her own.
"
FALSE,C+,Baby It's Me,Diana Ross,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7681,"
I've got nothing special against Richard Perry, although he used to find more interesting songs--and songwriters, which since he's now developed his own stable is more relevant. But even when he made interesting records he tended to push the epicenters of eccentric artists toward the middle of the road, and that's not what Diana needs. Her problem isn't her vocal limitations, although she's obviously no Betty Carter, but her blank taste. What if the best of the slick trivia here were combined with, I don't know, a good '30s pop tune done straight, a blues, something obscure by Al Green, something familiar by a non-Motown girl group? Might be worth hearing, and Perry could make it happen. Yeah sure.
"
FALSE,C+,Workin' Overtime,Diana Ross,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8313,"
How 'bout that--""an equity partner"" ""returns to the foundations of kids' street music,"" with well-known former expert Nile Rodgers guiding her every note. Which song means the most to her personally? Is it the well-named ""Workin' Overtime""? The even better-named ""Bottom Line""? Perhaps the revealing ""Going Through the Motions""? The answer is ""Take the Bitter With the Sweet."" Comments Ross: ""Every person and every moment is a combination of bitter and sweet, and that is what makes life so rich and surprising."" Thanks for letting us in on this secret, equity partner.
"
FALSE,C+,Skyscraper,David Lee Roth,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8317,"
In which the Van Halen parody of his debut LP gives way to the Vegas parody yeah-sure of his predebut EP. Instead of speed-metal, speed-Sinatra: while Steve Vai and Brent Tuggle make noises that once employed whole phalanxes of AFM members (brass and strings, respectively), Dave shares with us the wit and weary wisdom gained in his career at stud.
"
FALSE,C+,The Understanding,Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12933,"
Just as jungle tended toward soundtrack music for B thrillers in exotic locales, chill-out tends toward waiting-room music for plastic surgeons who really want you to order that butt implant. Where once these Norwegians were extolled for their subtle melodicism, here their schlock candidly attacks the jugular. If they're Air, Goldie was Tricky.
"
FALSE,C+,Back to the Drawing Board!,The Rubinoos,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7685,"
Live, this is a great '60s cover band--you should see how they choreograph ""Walk Don't Run."" Doing their own lame originals on record, though, they try so hard to sound fresh and appealing you get the feeling they're about to spit up on your shoulder.
"
FALSE,C+,Ask Rufus,Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7691,"
So Chaka's turning into a ""sophisticated song stylist."" Just what we needed. What she needs is sophisticated songs. They never learn.
"
FALSE,C+,Max,The Rumour,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7693,"
Because Graham Parker's songs take so long to kick in, I worried about coming down on his band too soon--until I realized that their songs already had kicked in, without my noticing or caring. The singers don't help the lyrics, the lyrics don't help the singers, and this is depressing.
"
FALSE,C+,Waitin' for the Night,The Runaways,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7697,"
This band surprised me live, nowhere near as willing to pander sexually as its publicity suggests, and Kim Fowley contributes his first decent tune since ""Alley Oop"" to the new album. I guess if somebody has to strike macho guitar poses I'd just as soon it were girls. But Joan Jett's inability to bellow through the wall of noise (she shrieks flatly instead) suggests that there are perhaps more generous musical models, for human beings of all sexes, than Aerosmith.
"
FALSE,C+,The Best of the Runaways,The Runaways,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8327,"
Ignore the sticker--if Kim Fowley had known how to make a Joan Jett album, he would have done the deed in 1976.
"
FALSE,C+,Hermit of Mink Hollow,Todd Rundgren,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3970,"
Only a weight as willfully light as Todd can be trusted to put his smartest song (""Onomatopeia"") on ""the easy side"" and his dumbest (""Bag Lady"") on ""the difficult side.""
"
FALSE,C+,Straight from the Heart,Patrice Rushen,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8328,"
Hard to believe this nouveau ingenue was once a full-time jazz pianist--forgetting ""Forget Me Nots,"" the whole first side could be one dancy vamp, and since in pop you're supposed to write the tunes beforehand you have to wonder how she fared when she had to make them up on the spot. Did a lot of vamping, I suspect. Granted, there's real songcraft on side two, if nouveau ingenues are your idea of real. I prefer side one.
"
FALSE,C+,Eternally Yours,The Saints,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7711,"
""Private Affair"" is the perfect punk-cum-early-Kinks song, ""International Robots"" invents a Jonathan Richman clone, and Chris Bailey should dub in the vocals on Seymour Stein's Wild in the Streets remake. But the lyrics are received protest, the tempos have slackened, and if those horns are somebody's idea of a joke I am not amused. The very idea.
"
FALSE,C+,Sakhile,Sakhile,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8331,"
When a black Johannesburg crossover band split up so they can ""grow musically"" and the bassist and sax player come up with a slack Crusaders homage, I understand--in South Africa that'll pass for progress. Here too, actually. But here I expect people to know better--especially record executives.
"
FALSE,C+,Silana Musango,Samite,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5940,"
It's hard to argue with the life choices of a Ugandan who lost a brother to Idi Amin. But when he opened for the gently ecstatic Samba Mapangala and the eternally vigorous Mahlathini at S.O.B.'s, he was a tragedy of ""world music."" Mapangala and Mahlathini, whose lives haven't been easy either, do what Afropop masters have always done: import American materials for their own uses. Samite is an exporter who treats music like a cash crop, adapting to the master culture rather than from it. On record you don't have to watch his drummer expressing her spirituality, and Bakithi Kumalo can flat-out play bass. But in any context Samite is soft-headed as a matter of principle--and by now, as a marketing strategy too.
"
FALSE,C+,Beer Cans on the Moon,Ed Sanders,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7712,"
Sanders has never been very programmatic, and lyrics like ""Nonviolent Direct Action"" are why. Even the thrusts at Henry Kissinger, Melvin Laird, and Dita Beard are heavy-handed. Believe me, I don't want the best song on the record to be about a robot in love with Dolly Parton. But that's the way it is.
"
FALSE,C+,Abraxas,Santana,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3101,"
On the debut most of the originals were credited to ""Santana Band""; this time individual members claim individual compositions. Can this mean somebody thought about these melodies (and lyrics!) before they sprung from the collective unconscious? In any case, they've improved. And in any case, the best ones are by Peter Green, Gabor Szabo, and Tito Puente, none of whom is known to be a member of the Santana Band.
"
FALSE,C+,Borboletta,Santana,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7718,"
Old Santana fans beware. Ad copy to the contrary, the only Latin roots here flowered in Brazil long 'round '66. Airto Moreira isn't Sergio Mendes, I admit, but Leon Patillo isn't Leon Thomas either.
"
FALSE,C+,Festival,Santana,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7720,"
As a salsa band they're still OK, but a ten-tune format and the sincere desire for AM proselytization don't make them a pop band. (Putting vocals on all the tracks might help.) It makes them a mediocre fusion band. (Is there another kind?)
"
FALSE,C+,Inner Secrets,Santana,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7722,"
It's sad when one of the few megagroups with a groove powerful enough to get it out of any jam resorts to hacks like Lambert and Potter for a hit. I mean, Santana is schlocky anyway. But Santana's own schlock has some dignity.
"
FALSE,C+,Surfing With the Alien,Joe Satriani,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5815,"
The latest guitar god calls up keywords like ""taste"" and ""musicality"" rather than ""flash"" and ""heavy""--not only does he write melodies (and countermelodies), he fuckin edits them. Thus he delivers both the prowess cultists demand and the comfort they secretly crave. That it surprises him to hear the result behind insurance commercials only goes to show how little guitar gods know of the world.
"
FALSE,C+,Your Daily Gift,The Savage Rose,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7727,"
Also known as the Copenhagen Rhythm and Blues Ensemble, this band has a knack for combining funky riffs with persistent melodies (borrowed from where, this ignorant American wonders). But though Annisette's multi-octave Lolita voice is certainly distinctive, I find her about as sexy as Yma Sumac, and as long as she sings Anders Koppel's lyrics she won't be any font of wisdom either. Last straw: a desultory eight-minute instrumental called ""Tapiola.""

Wonder how much Green knows about Immanuel Kant, who rhymes with ""Gaultier pants""--more than you or me, probably, and less than he should before he starts name-dropping. But thereafter he strives to right his arty rep. The ones that begin ""Gonna get that girl,"" ""I wanna get 'em girl,"" and ""Get you girl"" proceed as you'd expect, into a flighty funk of positively offensive banality. I always thought his pretensions were kind of fun myself.

Modes of integrity: Sedaka's Back, compiled from two-plus English albums, sounded organic, while this star-time El Lay session sounds homogenized. Neil's voice has changed--the light girl-groupy moments have turned bitchy and the sentimentality is thick with incipient sobs. Figure best-ofs are his natural element and remember that only if he goes away can he come back again.

FALSE,C+,Smokin' O.P.'s,Bob Seger,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7761,"
Zippy title for an album of seven covers and two originals--O.P.'s is Midwestern butt-bummers' slang for Other People's. But for some reason Seger has cadged songs already covered definitively by such other o.p. as B.B. King, the Isley Brothers, the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones. Both his band and his voice sound a lot more adroit than they did last time he was caught smokin'. But who needs 'em?

Slow songs about sex and medium-rocking songs about sex contend with slow songs about love and medium-rocking songs about love. Title, concept, and follow-up single: slow song about the futility of life. Just in case you think he's ""sold out"" or some such.

I had filed this as unlistenable until the amazing tuneout power of ""Roll Me Away"" piqued me into determining why. The songs aren't half bad--adequate melodically and with moments of good writing. But Seger's romantic individualism is a little simpleminded, more late-outlaw than Bruce, and it's suffocated by overstatement. Almost any country singer could show him how to approach a clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ kinda easy like. In fact, with his connections Seger could probably get lessons from Willie himself. But "

Seger has a brain--you'll learn more about revolutionary youth from ""Leanin on My Dream"" than from John Sinclair, who has a walk-on in ""Highway Child""--but you'd never guess it from his singing. He's one of these heavy guys who equates fake agony with real soul--wrote ""Song for Rufus"" to himself.

This is touted as the current Gamble-Huff sleeper, and no, that has nothing to do with her being married to one of them. It means that not only does it include two good songs, but that they come one after the other at the beginning of a side. Side two, in case you're interested.

Here's something you don't know how much you don't need--Dixie Chicks imitators. I do, because I also played the Lace album. The best-selling Osborn sisters have more jam. But although they swear they ""won't wear stiletto heels"" (unlike all those hussies at the Wal-Mart?), they definitely make nicer to men than Dolly and Loretta if not Tammy and Reba. Nothing in ""Still Holding Out for You,"" cowritten by none other than Richard Marx, suggests that smart sister Kristyn wouldn't dress like a slut to get him back. Somebody send that lovelorn lass a Victoria's Secret catalogue.

Driving through the Bronx on my way from South Carolina to Maine, I heard ""Lonely Android"" on the radio and wondered for a moment if the Ramones were making an art-rock move. This gaffe was probably a symptom of homesickness, but it does indicate that on record, where Annie Golden's Broadway proclivities are invisible, this becomes a vaguely interesting (or at least eccentric) band--Focus gone CBGB without chops, kind of.

The problem with the Japanese is that they don't know the difference between a Ramones song and a Wrigley commercial. But we do, or should, and these are Wrigley commercials, in which three lookee-no-touchee geishas do a good job of half implying that the supercatchy ""Banana Fish"" is a J.D. Salinger reference--in other words, that they condescend to American culture as much as American counterculture condescends to them. Unfortunately, the only thing that might make this ambiguity interesting would be musical dimensions they have no time, use, or aptitude for.

In the great Woodstock tradition, this gift from a flower (or two) to a generation (or two) is also a corporate boondoggle--a classy way for Warner Bros. artist Simon to rerecord, rerelease, and resell the catalogue CBS is sitting on. Paul has forgotten Art enough to relax as a singer, which means that much of the S&amp;G material has improved since 1971.

Given her self-knowledge and her fans' taste (they like her, right?), a compilation isn't going to get her at her best, though this does collect some of her more attractive melodies. Light a fart for the two big Jacob Brackman statements: ""Attitude Dancing,"" which means exactly what it says, and ""Haven't Got Time for the Pain,"" which doesn't, not quite--the most insidious let's-write-God-a-love-song to date.

Carly generally makes marriage seem both more boring and more nasty than I've found it to be, but not on this album, where matrimony is abandoned for more adolescent subjects. Even the two please-don't-cheat-oh-hubby songs--the better (and nastier) of them written by Carly's hubby--can be interpreted by her younger fans as please-don't-cheat-oh-boyfriend. In a way, this is too bad--if Carly were to come up with an interesting song about marriage, someone less conventional musically than Carly &amp; Arif might cover it and give Carola and me something new to sing along to. John and Yoko, where are you now that we need you?

With more effort than hedonism should ever require, I make out three or maybe four full-fledged melodies on this self-important, mysteriously prestigious essay in romantic escape.

If you hold your breath and are very good, maybe ""Kiss Me"" will prove a fluke. Maybe in the end it'll only be the innocent invitation to making out a deserving teen subdemographic craved. But don't tell yourself stories about biz or fundamentalist plots. Christians not proselytizers, they're an indie-rock success story who come by their limpid sound more organically than the Sundays or the Innocence Mission, both of whom they sincerely admire. Leigh Nash's clear little voice, like a young Natalie Merchant without the neurotic undertow? Her own. Matt Slocum's classed-up minor-key arrangements, like an acoustic Radiohead without the existential foofaraw? His own. They hope to create pretty, well-meaning stuff like this in perpetuity, for the sheer joy of it. Which means they could be nauseating urban skeptics for years.

Bio plays up their anti-""formula"" ""bad-itude,"" leaving open the question of whether any of these double-platinum Jerseyoid bar boys has recorded professionally before. Sounds like someone knows the formula: metal guitar plus amped-to-10 frontman times pop structure equals East Coast G N' R. Class animus is their excuse, the 9-to-5 dead end rejected for salvation by sleaze. Female characters include three hookers, a junkie, a classy bitch, a shotgun bride, a cheater who catches the back of her man's hand and the next train to Kalamazoo, and a crybaby craving ""more, more, more.""

From the clarion ""Treat Her Like a Prostitute"" through this bitch and that cocaine dolly and the fake virgin ""with a yay-wide gash"" and the one who meant yes when she said no and ended up marching a tribe of Indians out her cunt, this man hates women. His ballad is keyed around the refrain ""Don't hurt me again"" and is directed at all treacherous females, not just one. His anticrime warning closes with a convincing imitation of how bad you groan the first time you get cornholed.

Out of Squirrel Bait by Hunglikealbini, a Trojan horse. Extolled for their multipartite songforms and, da-da, dynamic shifts from soft to loud, as well as their intimate knowledge of mental illness, these guys look like unassuming alternative types and in real life may be same. Their sad-sack affect fits right in. But musically--structurally, as one might say--they're art-rockers without the courage of their pretensions.

One more complication in the Rod Stewart mystery. With Jeff Beck he parodies himself before he's established a self to parody. With Lou Reizner he establishes himself as a singer-songwriter of uncommon spunk and a vocal interpreter of uncommon individuality. And here he steps into the shoes of a purveyor of Humble Pie to pose as the leader of a mediocre white r&amp;b band. Best cut: Ronnie Lane's ""Stone.""

Makes sense that at this moment in history Al Gore's spiritual megrims seem so much more fascinating than Billy Corgan's-Gore might actually affect our lives.

I enjoyed the directness of this at first--piano improvisations striding over solid multi-percussion, in the spirit of Smith's former leader, Gato Barbieri, without the manic harshness.  Then I begin to hanker for some harshness. It's not just the strings, which are at least as intelligent as, say, Alice Coltrane's, and less ubiquitous. It's also the rhythms themselves, serving a purpose so expanded and cosmic that it's not even spiritual anymore, thus rendering their connection to the body irrelevant.

It makes a certain kind of sense to impose teen-macho aggression on your audience--for better or worse, macho teens are expected to make a thing of their unwonted hostility. These guys impose their post-adolescent sensitivity, thus inspiring the sneaking suspicion that they're less sensitive than they come on--passive-aggressive, the pathology is called, and it begs for a belt in the chops. Only the guitar hook of ""How Soon Is Now,"" stuck on by their meddling U.S. label, spoils the otherwise pristine fecklessness of this prize-winning U.K. LP. Remember what the Residents say: ""Hitler was a vegetarian.""

It would be a pleasure to dismiss Calvin Broadus's evocatively entitled No Limit debut as another piece of lowballing funk off the N.O. Bounce assembly line. But the lead ""Snoop World"" is the kind of track that can make an album, playing a synth-bass hook over a real bass line and under triangles and other high elements that never hint at G-funk keyb tweedle, and over the next few songs, cameos from No Limit's two best rappers, Mystikal and Mia X, clear the way for the unoriginal gangsta bull-roar of Master P and his brothers. But despite considerable input from Mystikal--whose deep-Delta bellow tenses powerfully against Snoop's honey-tongued indifference, adding moral weight to the usual professions of ""ex-drug dealer"" rectitude--the music soon runs down. And though Snoop is surely just a rapper now, he'd no more risk alienating his market than help a Blood's grandma across the street. Da game he's selling is sociopathic violence, and so he commits metaphorical murder, invites thugs to wave their gats in the air, cuts a biyutch improvident enough to suck his dick, and so forth. In short, he proves himself a born liar, showing all the imagination of an ATM in the process. Anyone who counts him a major artist because he can drawl and pronounce consonants at the same time should give equal time to Mariah Carey's high notes and George Winston's magic fingers.

""Do Right Woman"" is redundant, ""The Married Men"" funked up, and Patti Austin's ""In My Life"" just a dull song. ""He's Not Just Another Man"" has always been her problem.

Finally the answer to a question that's plagued me for years. I'd pound my pillow at night, drift into revery at convocations on fun, plumb forget how my dick got into my hand, wondering why, why, why I could never give two shits about Uncle Tupelo. But the answer, my friends, was blowing in . . . no, I mean hopes ""the wind takes your troubles away."" Name's Jay Farrar, never met a detail he couldn't fuzz over with his achy breaky drawl and, er, evocative country-rock--and needn't trouble with the concrete at all now that that smart-ass Jeff Tweedy is Wilco over-and-out. In the unfathomable Tupelo, Tweedy whiled away the hours writing actual songs, leaving Farrar the drudgery of mourning an American past too atmospheric to translate into mere words. As sentimental as Darius Rucker himself, Farrar is only a set of pipes and a big fat heart away from convincing millions of sensitive guys that he evokes for them.

He might have provided real songs after cut one side two, might have helped us believe in his ordinary blokehood by not putting the hotels he's trashed on a poster. Didn't really have to repeat the phrase ""kill my wife"" umpteen times (tell Britt it was only a ""very nasty dream"") or invoke ""Passion"" as universal solvent (like an asshole at a bar where the women are taken). And he didn't have to bury ""Oh God, I Wish I Was Home Tonight"" on an album no one will remember two years after it goes platinum. Vulnerable, waggish, rude, he begs his sweetie to save the best parts on her pornographic postcard for him. ""I haven't a cent,"" he adds, he's calling long distance on somebody else's phone.

But as we all now know, there's a backstory.  Band, check--Miami legends like Little Beaver and Timmy Thomas, with Miami legend Betty Wright calling the shots. But Stone isn't from Florida, she's from England, and the forgettables are covers too--the kind of soul marginalia Brits have been overrating since Doris Troy was on Apple. She's only 16, which explains the failed climax.

Nothing if not modest, less interpreter than pure medium, Strait lives and dies with his material. On this album ""Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her"" passes for a witticism, and while I know it's not saying much to observe that the Western swing ""White Christmas"" on his brand-new Merry Christmas Strait to You cuts anything here, would you believe ""Frosty the Snowman""?

FALSE,C+,Vicious but Fair,Streetwalkers,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7916,"
Artistically, this contingent of veterans is a casualty of punk; the stylized menace of their cultish, calibrated art-rock-cum-heavy-metal has been rendered obsolete by the outgoing explosiveness of the real thing. And although I've always been a nominal fan of Roger Chapman, it does serve him right--that's what you get for perfecting arrested-adolescent fantasies of sin and sexual warfare as your hairline recedes and your pot thickens.

FALSE,C+,Guilty,Barbra Streisand,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8452,"
Produced by Gibb-Galuten-Richardson, and Barbra Goes Disco ain't all. Somewhere in their success-addled minds Barry and Robin saw a chance to return to heartthrob ballads like ""To Love Somebody"" and ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?"" But after years of writing fluff--great fluff, occasionally, but fluff--they can't match that standard. Lucky for them Streisand doesn't oversing every time out, even floats some of the uptempo stuff--music of the spheres if you consider her voice a platonic ideal, polyurethane disco if you don't. But most of the time she oversings. And when she dramatizes a soap like ""Life Story,"" the mismatch is ridiculous.

A friend who loves this record offers the attractive theoretical defense that it unites the two strains of ""new wave"" rock minimalism--neoclassy synthesizer and three-chord barrage. So maybe it will prove popular among theoreticians. For the rest of us, though, there are little problems like lyrics that reduce serious politics to rhetoric, singing that makes rhetoric sound lurid, and the way the manic eccentricity of this duo's live performance turns to silliness on record.

They say this is the rock and roll of the future, which I find a depressing thought even though (or because) the amalgam is a moderately smart one. Straight-ahead art-rock, sort of--Queen without preening. Yes without pianistics and meter shifts. And ""Bloody Well Right"" documents a gift for the killer hook. Now if only ""Bloody Well Right"" weren't an impassioned plea for complacency. Maybe if we close our eyes they'll go away.

I like a hooky album as well as the next fellow, so when I found that this one elicited random grunts of pleasure I looked forward to listening hard. But the lyrics turned out to be glib variations on the usual Star Romances trash, and in the absence of vocal personality (as opposed to accurate singing) and rhythmic thrust (as opposed to a beat) I'll wait until this material is covered by artists of emotional substance--Tavares, say, or the Doobie Brothers.

In which the great pop factory of the '60s flounders around in the superstar '70s, incapable of fabricating hits around the greatest of girl-group trademarks. ""Stoned Love,"" from 1970, is the last undeniable single Berry Gordy's depleted forces can provide their act; by the time Smokey enters the lists in 1972 he's turned into an album artist.

The all-instrumental intro is the P-Funk horns as the Mar-Keys introducing Otis, and since Bootsy claims this light funk as his own concept quote unquote, don't blame George if Otis never shows.

Breasts barely budding beneath her rugby shirt on the back cover of Fool Around, she was a young sweet sixteen, but two years later she's no innocent--black leather jacket half unzipped, gauntleted hands over the face of her younger charge, she's seen one too many photos of Siouxsie Sioux. Only Siouxsie Sioux has a lousy voice--and Siouxsie Sioux knows what to do with it. A longtime pro if the truth be known, Sweet never quite connected as a new-wave ingenue, but there were nice tensions in the gaps. As a new-wave Linda Ronstadt--she covers Graham Parker, she covers Lou Reed, she covers the goddamn Damned--her only interesting song is one she wrote herself: ""Tonight Ricky,"" about how they're finally going all the way. It seems like an old memory.

This laid-back funk has body; it's physically attractive. And it's nice that T can put his own mild voice to his own mild lyrics like any other rock aristocrat. I might even agree that the candor of its complacency (one song puts down streetlights, another celebrates T's in-laws, the Kristoffersons) is refreshing. Actually, though, it pisses me off.

But though a couple of other songs here, notably ""Distant,"" indicate that their pan may flash again, late converts are advised to seek out the single and wish they could buy the disco disc.

If even his admirers acknowledge that his music has lost some of its drive (lost some of its drive?), then even a sworn enemy can admit that he's capable of interesting songs and intricate music. Having squandered most of the songs on his big success, he's concentrating on the intricate music--the lyrics are more onanistic than ever, escapist as a matter of conscious thematic decision. From what? you well may wonder. From success, poor fella. Blues singers lived on the road out of economic necessity, although they often got into it; Taylor is an addict, pure and simple. A born-rich nouveau star who veers between a ""homestead on the farm"" (what does he raise there, hopes?) and the Holiday Inn his mean old existential dilemma compels him to call home deserves the conniving, self-pitying voice that is his curse. Interesting, intricate, unlistenable.

This is no better than Mud Slide Slim (several good songs if you care about James's agonies) or One Man Dog (several interesting experiments if you care about James's ideas), and although it is better than Walking Man, so is The Best of the Cowsills. Basically a solid piece of singer-songwriter product--I might actively enjoy ""Lighthouse"" or ""Angry Blues"" if someone else sang them, and I enjoy ""Gorilla"" and ""Mexico"" now. So why do his devotees regard it as a heartening comeback? Because its desecration of Marvin Gaye has propelled it into the top ten? Or because they never cared about his agonies or ideas either?
"
FALSE,C+,Flag,James Taylor,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7969,"
What's wrong with most of these songs is that Taylor is singing them. He can sing, sure--the ""Day Tripper"" cover and ""Is That the Way You Look"" show off his amused, mildly funky self-involvement at its sharpest and sexiest. But too often the material reveals him at his sharpest and most small-minded; John Lennon might get away with ""I Will Not Lie for You,"" but JT's whine undermines whatever honesty the sentiment may have.

FALSE,C+,Eargasm,Johnnie Taylor,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7973,"
Taylor's commitment to the traditional soul style remains unimpeachable even when he accedes to material as modish as the likable but lightweight ""Disco Lady."" But to call him traditional is not entirely a compliment--he still lacks the kind of aggressive originality that can take a mediocre hook-and-lyric by the ear and drag it out of oblivion. Which is where too much of this album remains.
"
FALSE,C+,Echoes,Livingston Taylor,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7978,"
Vocally, Liv is almost James's twin but not quite--he adds a touch of depth to the lissome drawl and subtracts all wow and flutter. Since what makes James unique is also what makes him repulsive, I find Liv more likable but less interesting--especially given his songwriting, which this best-of, drawn from his three early '70s LPs, makes the best of. I ask you, what good is a funny voice without a sense of humor?

Bram's multitracked, overechoed interpretations of old-wave profundities like ""I'm the one that's leaving"" and new wave bromides like ""all these people suck"" makes him sound like a power pop Crosby, Crosby &amp; Crosby.

Of course Jack Black makes me laugh sometimes. He's got serious comic gifts. But the meanness of his joke band proves how much easier it is to act a role than inhabit a persona. I can imagine him playing a sympathetic character in a movie somebody else scripted. But I can't imagine him writing a song I cared about, even as a laugh, because he treats music the way his songs treat women--as a means to an end. What end, though? Getting laid is a snap, after all. Maybe just believing his life means a damn thing.

This beats Lighthouse (arrghh) and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (urrp), but with their intricate charts and printed music Michael Zager and Aram Schefrin make like they paid their dues in a conservatory.

The function of the catchy nothing-but-love-songs on this skillful but otherwise derivative slice of boogie is to enable Don Barnes to show the would-be hellions in his audience, all of whom have to betray their rowdy principles if they're to keep their jobs and get on with their lives, just exactly how a good old boy acts sincere.

B.J. might be the Johnny Rivers of the Leon Russell generation--he was born in Texas, after all--if only he had better taste. Some pleasant stuff complements the two great ones here--""Rock and Roll Lullaby,"" the hit, and the suppressed Carole King nasty, ""A Fine Way to Go""--but anyone who'd agree to record ""We've Got to Get Our Ship Together"" is in need of some brain-caulking himself.

The nadir of Thomas's art-song mode, which reduces music to a setting for words and voice, both exceedingly eccentric for better and mostly worse, and also--ironically, as they say--encourages the autonomy of musicians who like most musicians are wise to follow orders.

Tired of complaining about the problems of the world (not that anyone else noticed him doing it), Tom Bailey elects to add to them instead, with an English positivity album that's a case study in the limits of catchy--I'd pay money not to hum these tunes.

As a fan of this second banana, I'd hoped he'd earn his title. Unfortunately, no quantity of returned favors from such class pop-funkers as Kashif, Ray Chew, and Nile &amp; Bernard will do the trick for a man who not only doesn't sing as indelibly as pathfinder Luthern Vandross, which is understandable, but doesn't write as indelibly either. Best Chic song: the perky ""Perfect Lover.""

Those who whine that there are no new rock bands are too square to know where to find them--on commercial radio, they're as hot as teenpop right now. But although many of those that surface come complete with a winner like the sad-versed, jaunty-chorused ""Kryptonite,"" a sure shot for the Y2K'd and Confused remake Steve Case's boy will bankroll in 2020, good new rock bands are admittedly hard to come by.

I keep trying to find an analogy for the precious falsettos affected by this baroquely tuneful little band. But except maybe for that prepsychedelic Dreamer Freddie Garrity, none of the obvious influences--early Bee Gees, early Floyd, Strawberry Alarm Clock, Lemon Pipers--is insufferable enough. Really, fellows, the first time around this stuff might (I said might) have been fun. In 1983 it's likely to make a grown man puke.

Working on the humane assumption that all screamo records can't be equally horrible, the reviewerati have singled out this big-ticket effort, produced by Sleater-Kinney-certified Dave Fridmann. Unburdened by theory, however, I find that its distinction boils down to slightly subtler tunecraft and dynamic range. At any volume, Geoff Rickley still sounds like the kind of young man who, when they change his prescription so it doesn't upset his stomach, suddenly becomes more optimistic. This happened, he says, and while it's understandable, it suggests the limits of his political analysis. Romantic, too: Toward the end he's emoting at the top of his lungs about love like a carousel and 50 decaying roses. Takes things hard, does Geoff. That's why he became an artist.

FALSE,C+,Close to the Bone,Tom Tom Club,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8510,"
As a one-off, this band was a delight, with a big push from the riff of the '80s and the help of consistently sly and kooky lyrics. But in rock and roll, delight is a fragile thing, and this codification flirts with the insufferable. The simplistic tunes and sing-song delivery do no service to the coy credos of freedom, equality, and happiness they accompany, and there are times when all this praise of jitney drivers and four-way hips suggests the kind of irresponsible exoticism cynics always suspect when rich white people find the meaning of life in the tropics.

This spinoff seemed like a good idea at the time because a good idea was all it was. As a career alternative that lets them feel useful when David goes off on a tangent, it's product. The Arthur Baker-coproduced late-'88 stuff is arch, subfunctional dance music that transmutes ""Wild Wild West"" into ""Wa Wa Dance"" without the writing credit Sugarhill ceded ""Genius of Love"" way back when. The late-'87 is minimalist Europop, and in that it's not charmless.

Mysticism should keep its own counsel; boast about it, translate your supposed experience of the ineffable into any but the most simpleminded ideology, and ninety-five times out of a hundred you'll sound like a smug asshole. Tosh's ever more preachy vocal stance does nothing for his dopey puns (""shitty"" for ""city,"" far out), his confused political-economic theories, or his equation of hamburgers with heroin. And his musicians sound like the bored pros rockers so often turn into.

I've always found pleasure in Toussaint's hackwork and clucked sympathetically over his ambitious failures, but complaints about Jerry Wexler's conventional soul production here miss the point--it's Toussaint himself who aspires to conventionality. Abandoning the infectious, melody-shy chanting of his best LPs, he now sings with all the passion of James Taylor, which is probably as close to Glen Campbell as he can get. Auditioning for ""Southern Nights II"" there are various mild concoctions--I forget which is which, but the title tune could well be with Barry Manilow at this moment--that are not offset by several mixed successes and one reminder of eccentricities past. ""Optimism Blues"" indeed.

No matter whose top forty Lenny Williams makes, this isn't a soul, funk, or r&amp;b band--the arrangements are simply too complex. It's more a stripped-down (no trombones except for guest shots) big band in the era of Doc Severinsen. Compare to any Basie edition and you will hear written charts that sound spontaneous, not to mention estimable soloists and Basie himself.

Shorn of the voice-overs and bad dialogue designed to make the ""dramatic"" version as explicit as multileveled self-referentiality can be, what I'd dreamed might be his sparest, strongest, sweetest set of songs in years turns out to have needed all the camouflage it could get. It's long been evident that what turned Tornshend on about pop art was the art rather than the pop--he didn't want to drag opera down to rock's level, he wanted to raise rock to opera's. In practice, this means he has a fatal weakness for long synth intros. After the jagged surprises of the lead ""English Boy,"" there are far fewer intelligent moments than a guy this intelligent out to keep in his back pocket. If he's so damn worried about the postinformation age, it's because he's in the information business and is afread of getting left behind. And he damn well should be.

Their knack for songwriting always surprises me, because they deserve worse, and on this album they provide it, drenching their material in the grandiose harmonies and pomprock keyboard textures that thrive in the Midwest, where many poor souls still regard these transparent cynics as avatars of the new wave.

Encouraged by ""a black friend"" (Uncle Remus?) to ""let this r&amp;b music out,"" these soulful California cats did their professional best to simulate a Journey album. Well, all right, not quite--Journey's never sublimated misogyny into a hit single about sex emporiums, nor induced Maurice White to advocate cunt-lapping, nor essayed a Captain Beefheart imitation, nor risked an all-percussion extravaganza ""inspired by Sandy Nelson,"" nor closed off with an ambiguous comment from a black friend that I hope will make Tubes fans wonder who's got the inside track in any racial crossover.

The problem with Tanya's crossover is her functional but rather tiny brain--if only she had some real idea of exactly what she wanted to become, her pipes would put it across. Despite the heavy hoopla, the rock move here comprises three of the '50s classes that have always been her meat, and all that distinguishes this from earlier MCA Tanya is that Jerry Goldstein, her new intellectual adviser, has contributed three unusually bad songs.

Twilley's first two albums were marginally fascinating because of how obsessively he synthesized the Southern and British pop-rock traditions--like a cool Alex Chilton, or (only we didn't know this yet) a Nick Lowe who worked too hard--and because so few bands were bothering with the kind of catchy '60s-AM songs that Twilley turned out by the half dozen. Well, scratch the catchy part--both the Records and the Knack, to stick to the lightweights, have songs on the radio that cut anything on Sincerely, which is a lot catchier than this. And while you're at it, scratch Phil Seymour, Twilley's former rhythm section and harmony group. And add Jimmy Haskell doing Paul Buckmaster imitations. And think dark thoughts about the Raspberries and Eric Carmen.

FALSE,C+,Me Against the World,2Pac,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7,"
Tough-guy sentimentality is an old story in American culture, but self-pity this rank is usually reserved for teen romances and tales of brave avant-gardists callously rejected by the mass media. His I-love-Mom rings true because Mom was no saint, and his respect for old G's seems genuine, probably because they told him how smart he was. But whether the metaphor be dead homies or suicide threat, the subtext of his persecution complex is his self-regard. What's doubly galling is that these are essential hip hop themes--as Ice Cube and B.I.G. have made all too vivid, it is persecution that induces young black men to kill each other and themselves. That such themes should rise to the top of the charts with this witless exponent of famous-for-being-famous is why pop fans decry the mass media.

Americans enticed by talk of ""rock""-dance fusion should bear in mind the cultural deprivation of our siblings across the sea. Befuddled by the useless ""rock""-""pop"" distinction, they believe ""rock"" is something that happened in the '70s. The more inquisitive among them are aware of Pearl Jam and Nirvana, but if they've ever heard of Los Lobos or Husker Du they probably think they're ""pop."" So check out these comparisons from admirers of this inflated trio, spawned by the famously bad new-romantic band Freur and an ""art collective"" others might call an advertising agency: ""pre-stadium Simple Minds,"" ""way beyond the length of a Frank Zappa guitar solo,"" ""J.J. Cale on an ecstasy comedown,"" ""a warm bath."" Plus their proper predecessors Pink Floyd ""with bigger bass sounds and better drum patterns."" Here and there--eight minutes into ""Kiteless,"" for instance--they do work up a dangerously off-kilter groove. But the lyrics of Animals were more than ""insane ramblings"" or ""the colours of cars going past a friend's house."" And Ummagumma had more purity of purpose.

FALSE,C+,Boy,U2,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4059,"
Their youth, their serious air, and their guitar sound are setting a small world on fire, and I fear the worst. No matter where they're starting off--not as big as Zep, maybe, but not exactly on the grunge circuit either--their echoey vocals already teeter on the edge (in-joke) of grandiosity, so how are they going to sound by the time they reach the Garden? What kind of Christian idealists lift their best riff from PIL (or from anywhere at all)? As bubble-headed as the teen-telos lyrics at best. As dumb as Uriah Heep at worst.

Not counting ""Superstar"" and ""Until You Come Back to Me,"" which perish in the tragic flood of feeling that finishes this album off, the only songs here that might conceivably survive without their support system are ""I'll Let You Slide,"" which Luther lets slip, and the one that donates its title to the venture. Nor does Luther augment the support system's golden-voiced rep by sharing ""How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye"" with Dionne Warwick, who cuts him from here to Sunday. In short, he sounds like an ambitious backup singer.

Never let it be said that popular styles don't evolve--in the wake of Kiss and Boston, this is heavy metal that's pure, fast, and clean. No mythopoeia, no bombast, and even the guitar features are defined as just that. So how come formalists don't love the shit out of these guys? Not because they're into dominating women, I'm sure.

Better her closely observed recent songs than a tale of brave Ulysses or a lover with ""hands of raining water"" (wet yes, hot no). But close observation is still Creative Writing, and if Vega eventually graduates to, say, the flat command of Ann Beattie, she'll still be precisely nowhere. Real pop lyrics ignore such strictly literary alternatives altogether.

The reason these Aussies saved neither Capitol Records nor rock and roll isn't this duff follow-up. It's their duff debut. Inferior to not just Nirvana but Oasis, led by a spoiled jerk who can't sing the lyrics he can't write, and of negligible musical interest beyond the stray hook, they demonstrated the biz's conceptual bankruptcy by parlaying a fluke hit into brief next-big-thingdom.

First time out they sounded so original musically that I made it a spiritual exercise to forgive Gordon Gano his bad personality. But everything you might hum along with on the sequel was invented generations ago by better men than he.

Last time he was an urban romantic with a good eye who you would have figured for a Ferlinghetti fan if you'd thought about it. This time he begins to sound like a Ferlinghetti imitator, and while nostalgia for past bohemias sure beats nostalgia for past wars, it's still a drain and a drag. I mean, there might be more coverable songs here if maudlin melodies didn't merge with neon imagery in the spindrift dirge of the honky-tonk nicotine night. Dig?

Stopped playing so fast, hoo boy. And most important, switched vocalists from Nick Cave imitator to Rufus Wainwright imitator. Wainwright makes up better melodies with a dick in his mouth, and not only that, Cave has more literary ability. New York scene or (hint hint) no New York scene, DreamWorks isn't buying.

Well, ""Second Hand Store"" is fairly likable, but keep it to yourself--a follow-up would ruin everything. ""Life's Been Good"" is not only Summer Song '78, it was born to be a novelty one-shot, and that it happens to say more about the tribulations of stardom than all the concept albums ever devised on the subject just goes to show how deeply significant AM radio can be.

I actually found myself paying attention to the dialogue on this soundtrack, a first, though I didn't ask for seconds. It's pretty coherent musically, too.

""Hasbrook Heights"" is no ""Walk On By,"" but it is an ambitious, honest song about the pleasures of the suburbs, where her chosen audience resides. Unfortunately, it's outnumbered by ambitious, dishonest songs directed at the same audience. Whether Hal David takes care of the liberal pieties himself (""Be Aware"") or passes them along from Jacques Brel (""If We Only Have Love"") and Lesley Duncan (""Love Song""), he's selling lies so blatant and boring that even his chosen audience must know it. And while Burt Bacharach's four arrangements (unlike those of Bob James and Don Sebesky, who get three each) are more tart and surprising than ever, too often he underlines ""meaning"" with the little dramatic touches of someone who'd like to get into something classier than the record business, like the Broadway stage.

The only thing he isn't is a compelling artist. He can't sing at all, can't write much, and still pretends the bass solo is a viable musical form. Like fIREHOSE (sic), like his name-dropping solo debut, this ""punk rock opera"" (""I just hate the words 'concept record.' That's fucking tired-ass, where opera's funny"") looks great on paper and hasn't been played for a year by anyone it impressed.

It's to the half-credit of these Bucks County wise guys that the studio amenities of their major-label debut impel them toward fucked-up sounds, which come hard, rather than fucked-up songs, which they write without thinking (and how). But I don't buy the claim that they'll do anything for a laugh. Ever since they went on about pussy for nine minutes (good idea) in a Princey blues-minstrel drawl (bad one), I've assumed they were the kind of rec-room gigglefritzes who enjoy a good nigger joke when they're sure their audience is sophisticated enough to enjoy it.

It should surprise no one who's kept an eye on Weir over the years that he manifests himself here as an El Lay country-rock crooner with studio-duperstar backup. But I bet thousands of Dead heads are lying to themselves about it right now, while at the same time Dead haters equate him with Richie Furay and Michael Murphey. Predictably, Weir is better--funnier, more feeling, harder to predict. But how much better can an E. L. c.-r. c. be?

His two previous albums having slipped precipitously (last one didn't even make top hundred), White here recoups by hiring out the songwriting and acceding to such fads (in a style he damn near created) as the ticking cymbal and the tocking horn chart.

Because he sticks to his roots, White has those who don't trust rock-as-art all hot and bothered. Well, I don't trust rock-as-art myself, but I don't trust these bayou set pieces either. White's tales of spiders, widders, conjure wimmin, and wayward rich girls all sound like I've seen them on television, only there they had endings. Nor do the Otis Redding and Junior Walker covers teach me anything new. The John Lee Hooker is better. As are ""Save Your Sugar for Me,"" about teenage sex, and ""Stockholm Blues,"" about a songwriter from the bayous who goes somewhere in an airplane.

The age of AIDS hasn't left him untouched--he takes his women one at a time and indulges in telephone sex. But usually Junior comes on like such a wild-ass that you can only tell him from the average rapper by his primitive sense of rhythm and his failure to mention the size of his dick. Last album was called Born To Boogie, this one features Gary Rossington in Skynyrd simulations that top Skynyrd's own, and the CMA is so desperate to stay up-to-dately in-the-tradition that it keeps kissing his ass. Not that ""If the South Woulda Won"" can be said to go against the Nashville grain--nobody really wants to go back to slavery, understand, but if that's the price of more hangings and no more foreign cars, we may have to bite the bullet. Anyway, Hank drops in a good word for Martin Luther King on the very next song. How much do these people want?

His first single, ""Shoo Doo Fu Fu Ooh,"" was a young singer's whoop of triumph from the top of the world. It seemed to promise many more. But after three mediocre LPs--the first still the best--I've given up. Williams's subsequent tries at simple, ecstatic black pop have sounded like expert imitations, and most of the time he's just a love man, doing his best to shore up songs that were made to be broken.

Classy arena-rock, that's what, redolent at its best of his fellow studio obsessives in Steely Dan, only never as smart, and at its worst more like REO Speedwagon. His radio-ready arrangements, hired lyrics, and funk borrowings are all hallmarks of the most venal popular music of the age, and that his synthesizer moves were slightly ahead of their time doesn't make them an iota less annoying.

The playing (not much feedback) is better than the vocals is better than the songs, and on the whole it's pretty dumb.

FALSE,C+,Neil Young and the Shocking Pinks/Everybody's Rockin',Neil Young,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2526,"
If Ronnie and Nancy are the only everybodies rockin' by name on the less than rousing title finale, then maybe what Neil means to say is that basic rockabilly isn't worth too much all by its lonesome. I agree, but expect the argument would be more convincing if Neil plus Ben Keith could match Brian Setzer chop for chop. The covers are redundant or worse, as are all but two of the originals. I hope Robert Gordon or somebody rescues ""Kinda Fonda Wanda."" And I hope Neil realizes that for all the horrible truth of ""Payola Blues,"" nobody's three thou's gonna get this on top forty.

FALSE,C+,Landing on Water,Neil Young,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2528,"
Hidden away on this rock bellyflop (which must be scandalizing 'em in Nashville) are hints that he may still be a crazed genius--the hook on the otherwise more-than-predictable ""Drifter,"" the urban neurosis of ""Pressure,"" and especially the broken yet still encouraging ""Hippie Dream."" But from straightforward confessional to brand-new drummer, it's the dullest record he's ever made.

FALSE,C+,Silver and Gold,Neil Young,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2541,"
Previously, Young's bad records have always had the mark of weirdness on them--impossible songs, twisted politics, stupid clothes. These 10 well-culled copyrights, two from the '80s and only four from 2000, are something new and ominous, because they're dull. They smell of equine methane: the old-fart hegemony that fuels alt-country, AC radio, and literary anthologies canonizing Ry Cooder, Ernie K-Doe, and Spooner Oldham. So though Duck Dunn and Jim Keltner get more beats going than Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina ever will, their mild funk is just another species of roots politesse, and Neil's self-indulgently halting vocals open the dismaying possibility that he takes Will Oldham seriously. True love isn't this boring, Young must know that. Hell, the Buffalo Springfield weren't this boring either. But they are now.

FALSE,C+,Elephant Mountain,The Youngbloods,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10870,"
C is for chi-chi. In the manner of tight groups, the Youngbloods stretch thinner all the time. Not only have they lost Jerry Corbitt, but their own expertise has become somehow attenuated. Banana used to be the most tasteful electric pianist in rock. Now he has become so tasteful he can sounds like Roy Kral on a lazy night. This is a bad week for personnel listings--down a notch.

FALSE,C+,Zapp,Zapp,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8675,"
""More Bounce to the Ounce,"" exactly. Like Bootsy's other funk alternative, Roger Troutman is a bit light--even when he grooves rather than croons he bounces rather than whomps. What makes him a smash with the black audience where the Sweat Band is barely a swoosh is his drolly mechanical detachment--especially when he turns on the vocoder, he could be Gary Numan with ants in his pants, or Kraftwerk on the one.

FALSE,C+,Chunga's Revenge,Frank Zappa,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8191,"
Like Bobby Sherman, Zappa is a selfish exploiter of popular taste. That Bobby Sherman wants to make money while Zappa wants to make money and emulate Varese is beside the point--if anything, Zappa's aestheticism intensifies his contempt for rock and its audience. Even Hot Rats, his compositional peak, played as much with the moods and usages of Muzak as with those of rock and roll. This is definitely not his peak. Zappa plays a lot of guitar, just as his admirers always hope he will, but the overall effect is more Martin Denny than Varese. Also featured are a number of ""dirty"" jokes.

FALSE,C+,Roxy and Elsewhere,Frank Zappa/Mothers,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8196,"
You can actually hear Zappa thinking on ""More Trouble Every Day,"" and ""Son of Orange County"" is an uncommonly understated Nixon tribute. The rest is the usual eccentric clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s, replete with meters and voicings and key changes t"
FALSE,C+,One Size Fits All,Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8197,"
Zappa's music has gotten a little slicker rhythmically--which is what happens when you consort with jazz guys--but basically it's unchanged. And his satire has neither improved nor deteriorated--if his contempt would be beneath an overbright high school junior, there's also a brief lieder parody that I'd love to jam onto WQXR. What's changed is the tastes of his erstwhile lionizers--they've gotten bored with his repertoire of stylistic barbarities. Us smart people just got bored faster.

FALSE,C+,Joel Zoss,Joel Zoss,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8201,"
As an unmistakably genuine artist who is unmistakably limited and unmistakably easy to dislike--his manipulative moan reminds Carola that ""there are worse things in men than machismo""--Zoss raises the question of whether nice, bright product isn't sometimes preferable to realized art. Personally, I'll take good Anne Murray any day.

FALSE,C+,Tejas,ZZ Top,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8203,"
Touring the way this band does tears you up by the roots, until the digs at Rolling Stone assume an authenticity lacking in the tales of the Pan-Am Highway. But this is the first trio to hark back to country music as well as blues, and they're brawnier than anything that comes out of Austin. You think Kinky Friedman will cover ""Arrested for Driving While Blind""?
