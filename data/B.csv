With Eurodisco orgymaster Cerrone and Ameridisco worker-bee Sam Dees augmenting Anglodisco scenemaker Richard Burgess in the coproducer's slot, you-know-what revival is obviously on tap. Ah well, it could be lots worse, and it probably will be--I hope not with this artist, a likable fella whose Teddy Pendergrass impression has its social function. Though speaking of soul, I wonder why the only ladyfriend he makes me care about is eight years old tops.

Even on generic rockabilly Gerald Duncan has a way with words, pinning down the thwarted lust that's always added nervous energy to the style. ""Two Girls in Love"" is as fine a lesbians-from-the-outside song as the Amazing Rhythm Aces' ""Emma-Jean,"" and ""Regina"" brings ""Brother Louie"" down home. Duncan comes up with hooks half the time, too. But his singing is so mild and his band so contained that only the most striking material lifts off. Just our luck that in an age of interesting bands with nothing to say an interesting songwriter doesn't put quite enough into the music.

The soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive is no best-of, not with Bon Scott shafted (the tired ""Ride On"") and two of the three new songs instrumentals. Still, one instrumental is showtime, the title tune is really a tune, ""Hell's Bells"" will give Christians fits, and sexual metaphors are kept to a minimum. I wish their only great work of art, the drum-hooked fucksong ""You Shook Me All Night Long,"" wasn't buried on side one the way it's buried in Black in Black. But this is their most presentable collection nevertheless.

This isn't rock and roll, sez here--it's ""sexmusic,"" a/k/a ""antmusic,"" heralding Arapaho (Apache) (Kiowa) (pirate) warrior ideals as a futuristic reaction against Brit-punk nihilism. The scam has whole subcultures working for it in England, but here it's the sex and the music that'll determine whether Adam is David Bowie or Marc Bolan (or Gary Glitter). The sex is your basic line-drawings-of-spike-heels stuff, redolent of Sex, the haberdashery once owned by Adam's ex-manager. The music, needless to say, is rock and roll, a clever pop-punk amalgam boasting two drummers, lots of chanting, and numerous B-movie hooks. Especially given Adam's art-schooled vocals, I find that the hooks grate, but that may just mean that when it comes to futuristic warriors I prefer Sandinistas.

Brutally honest right down to the name, the label promotes South African pop pros Thomas Mkhize and Glynn Storm as ""more structured and somewhat less dense than Adï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"" praising their ""state-of-the-art production values, modern instrumentation, and pronounced rock, jazz, and pop influences."" In short, decorative exoticism, a touch slick, with pleasing Zulu chant melodies and a trap drummer who'd fit in on Carson. I like every one of its six cuts. And love none of them.

I have hated these Beantowners steadfastly through independent singles, a guest shot at Max's, and Live at the Rat. White r&amp;b with poor epiglottal hygiene, who needed it? Yet I've grown fond of this album. What seemed silly if not self-indulgent eccentricity in a failed thirty-five-year-old rock and roller is brave and funny on an honest-to-God major-label elpee. And ""Lookin' Like a Bimbo"" is an anthem for failed thirty-five-year-old rock and rollers.

A heroin album, take it or leave it--""Junkhead"" certainly isn't ""ironic"" and probably isn't ""fictional"" either. Crunch crunch crunch, riff riff riff--way harder, louder, and more metallic than Soundgarden ever will be. But the price of this power is that it's also uglier and stupider--the sound of hopeless craving. Sitting here with my ""books and degrees"" (well, degree), I very much doubt that if I ""opened my mind,"" as resident sickman Layne Staley suggests, I'd be ""doing"" like him (er, the narrator of the song).

Juarez, this sculptor-painter cum singer-songwriter's 1975 debut, was pretentiously half-assed mock mythopoeia; Lubbock (on Everything), his 1979 double, was genuwine laugh-a-minute highbrow-lowbrow. This time Allen's satire is a little thinner, and he undercuts his more sincere songs by playing them for comedy, the only vocal trick he knows. ""Texas Tears,"" ""The Night Cafe,"" and ""Redbird""--plus some funny ones--are recommended to sideman Joe Ely, whose band has always mystified the Panhandle.

Gregg still doesn't know the difference between drawling slowly and singing soulfully, and it isn't tragedy that makes him sound so doleful, it's a limited formal imagination. That said, it must be admitted that he puts a lot into ""These Days"" and ""Midnight Rider,"" and that the reason you can listen to such originals as ""Please Call Home"" and ""Multicolored Lady"" isn't the writing.

Side three is a magnificent testament. It opens with Gregg doing Sonny Boy Williamson justice, wrenches through some of the most formally intense accompaniment Duane ever played, skips into a high-spirited Dickey Betts tune, and provides a coda for a whole sensibility in one two-minute acoustic duet. Side one sandwiches two subordinary Greggeries around an instrumental excursion that sounds like Dickey OD-ing on Live/Dead. And sides two and four comprise thirty-four minutes with an all-too-relaxing theme by Donovan Leitch. I know the pace of living is slow down there, but this verges on the comatose. And all the tape in the world isn't going to bring Duane back.

Showcasing two deserving mbaqanga acts, both fond of squeezeboxes. Good. But as an American who's listened to more mbaqanga than 99 per cent of those who've heard any at all, I shouldn't have to strain to distinguish between the one described as spearheading a ""revitalization of traditional Zulu music"" and the one said to be ""zulu jive's fastest rising group.""

He's smart, he's honest, but what makes him a country comer is the edge on his husky baritone, too indistinct and decorative to be called a vibrato or even a burr. His instinctively sentimental reading of ""Don't Think Twice"" establishes the limits of baritone, smarts, and honesty all at once, and I spent enough time pondering whether this was worth a B plus to conclude that I'd have known in a jiffy if I was as familiar with the Frizzell and Delmore covers as I am with the Dylan.

These three guys are smart enough to know they have a problem--they can't sing. They're also smart enough not to let that stop them. After declining the Most Inappropriate Cowpunk Band Name Lariat Twirl and qualifying for the Eklekticism Rools Speed Trials, they enter the Music Machine Memorial Songwriting Contest and do all right--you'd swear ""Just to Please You"" (or was it ""Never Going to Apologize""?) was the track that caught you humming on Pebbles VI.

Those who believe the serious and the ponderous are linked at the brainstem will welcome Turner's strained metaphors and sour mood. Those who can't stand it when a bright young band heads for the toilet will try to forget the slick tile that was his Last Shadow Puppets thing. Talented lad, Turner.

""Dance in the Smoke"" is to ""Time of the Season"" as ""Time of the Season"" was to ""She's Not There,"" extending ex-Zombie keyboardist-vocalist-composer Rod Argent's pop breathiness another quantum away from cuteness and toward incantation.

It took me a long time to hear that this forthright (not to say stentorian) black Englishwoman was anything more than a postfeminist Odetta, but it's clear in retrospect that Armatrading was reaching for something more colorful and less pompous even on her apparently folky 1973 debut, Whatever's for Us, produced by Eltonian concertmaster Gus Dudgeon. Two years later, on Back to the Night, she had shucked both the portentous prettiness of Dudgeon and the vague portentousness of lyricist Pam Nestor, but only here, with production from Glyn Johns, does she find a context forceful enough to give her own maturing lyrics an edge. Helps that she's more comfortable singing, too.

Some faithful decry the bows to pop fashion from lounge to CHR, others hear her fulfilling her destiny. Haven't her fans learned after all these years that beyond raw tunecraft her music is irrelevant?

Here we come up against the perils of Christianity as a political matrix in black music (and life). I don't doubt the goodness of Arrington's heart any more than I do his Stevie-cum-Bootsy vocal and rhythmic dexterity. But last time he was brimming with charity and full of fun, where now the anxiety that besets anyone who sticks to ""old-fashioned"" values in a time of upheaval erodes his tolerance. So he sounds a little frightened--of gays, of teen violence, of a ""new age"" that won't look like his dreams no matter how many anthems he writes. He misses Martin Luther King a lot. So do we all.

Arrington's bass does pop now, but whether you really get his funk depends on how well you connect with the way he turns the style's loony-toon vocals into pear-shaped tones. Me, I jump only for the synthesized-kalimba hook of ""Young and Ready,"" and he chants that one.

Despite rock instrumentation from Fred Frith, Chris Cutler, and friends and the rousing Who quote that kicks the best original song into high, this music is either consciously antipopular or ""serious"" with pretensions to accessibility. In either case it's Art--political Art, I know. The problem is, I don't get as much out of it as I do out of, say, the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier, or at least Bertolt Brecht and Hans Eisler, whose ""On Suicide"" announces the band's intent. Despite Dagmar's self-indulgent austerity, the stark, atonal music is often compelling, but while the lyrics are never stupid, they do depend on intellectual commonplaces--labyrinth imagery, reference to Greek myth, and other roundabout ways of saying not much. ""In Two Minds,"" about a teenager's schizophrenia, is a commonplace too, but an illuminated one. And the envoi to Piers Plowman is a touch I like.

There's no denying that this concatenation of musical-instrument imitations and collapsing new sound effects generates considerable episodic interest and the occasional groove.

People say they take after the Dolls, but I hear the Boomtown Rats. At its best, their burlesque on a ""teenage jerk off"" (a title) who still gets ""grounded"" (another) is funny and a little nasty. At its worst it's boring and a little too nasty. In between it's got verve and you've heard it before.

They need more to get by, but they can call a filler instrumental ""Bourgiï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"" if they want--they've earned it. The important thing is that after writing for Marvin &amp; Tammi (&amp; Diana) for all those years they've finally figure out how to sound like them. Upwardly mobile.

If I gave points for attitude, I'd up this a notch for fidelity to formula: Nick and Val wrote it, Nick and Val sang it, Nick and Val produced it, and they hope you like it too, Mr. Crossover Gatekeeper. But not even ""Nobody Walks in L.A.,"" which makes good on its title but is too quirky and local for a single, takes it on home.

This band has stopped trying to straddle their original home, West Virginia, and their spiritual one, Berkeley. Now comes the straight country push, and just in case the straight country isn't buying fetching Western swing with a '70s accent, once or twice those fiddles even sound like strings.

Now that its musicianship and production values are established, the album quality of this excellent but marginal band will depend mostly on the song quality.

Produced by the System, a/k/a Mic Murphy and David Frank, they got the juice--all three of these young people possess more mellifluous voices than Murphy, and more singing technique as well.

These fourteen cuts constitute the recorded output of a late-'70s San Fran punk band best remembered for ""We Are the One,"" the finest U.S. indie single of 1977, and a 1979 Steve Jones-produced EP. The notes extol their ""breakthrough--however brief--into a vision of life expressing firsthand passion and revolt,"" but to me Penelope Houston sounds like a valley girl with too much attitude. If her ""We are not Jesus (Christ!)/We are not fascist (pigs!)/We are not capitalist (industrialists!)/We are not communists"" confounded cant on the single, over the long haul her antipolitical railing, lapsed-Catholic obsessions, and assertions of self-sufficiency protest too much.

This cuts Cut the Cake and finds what Soul Searching was looking for, a tribute not to chemistry but to simple addition. Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart are OK vocalists themselves, and King isn't artist enough to turn AWB into a backing band. But ""A Fool for You Anyway"" and ""A Star in the Ghetto"" are King's meat, far superior to whatever ricky-tick originals AWB might have put in their place. And in the absence of ricky-tick, such AWB shtick as ""Keepin' It to Myself"" and Ned Doheny's ""Get It Up for Love"" sound quite rocky-tock.

Remixing the signature cut from their best (first) album and adding three old B sides that beat the filler off its Knopflerized follow-up, this is cultbound nevertheless: too slight and loose for anybody but converts and mamas to love, or buy.

Rakim raps quick and clean and almost quiet about the business at hand, which is moving the crowd.

Though Teddy Riley got the credit, the streetwise sweets of new jack love man Bobby Brown were mostly this producer's doing, and for his star turn he dispenses with the new jack--comes packaged as the title concept, with no prerogatives and not too many fast ones to spoil the fantasy. I mean, after he gets home from work, fantasy enough in the age of structural unemployment, he promises to cook dinner too. This would have serious attractions as a corrective to the sexist fantasies of hip-hop if there was any reason to think neo-B-boys would listen.

I don't think these guys imitate the Beatles just so Paul will give them more hits--they've got hits of their own. But from the guitar parts (play ""Better Days"" right after ""I Feel Fine"") and harmonies (the Paul of ""I've Just Seen a Face"" atop the Paul of ""Long Tall Sally"") to concept and lineup, an imitation is what this is, modernized slightly via some relaxed countrification. They write almost well enough to get away with it, too.

Yet admirers claim it as a masterwork rather than a commercial stopgap. Nonsense. Given the Band's ordinary woodenness in performance, the playing and singing are spirited, and Allen Toussaint's horn arrangements add genuine punch instead of the usual fuss, although they never reshape--as oppose to redecorate--the material. But this is clearly the testament of artists who are looking backwards because the future presents itself as a vacuum--a problem that has afflicted even their best work.

Bandy and Stampley, honchos of the hard-assed nouveau honky-tonk style that is Nashville's answer to Texas outlawism, tend to sound pretty dolorous as solo artists. Bandy is still obsessed with cheating as both doer and done; Stampley's more cheerful, but as an ass man of the sincere-if-bearded school he spends a lot of time singing persuasive ballads. Like most country albums, theirs are spotty; recent song titles include ""To Cheat or Not to Cheat"" and ""I Don't Lie,"" and those are highlights. As a duo, though, they whoop and holler and get hairy, lie to each other's wives and trade wedding rings for outboard motors. The material is still spotty, but since it's always Friday night they can shout right through the spots. All of which goes to show that male bonding is more likely to pick up the tempo than love and marriage.

The second was released in England just before Atom Heart Mother in 1970, which must have made a striking contrast; in the wake of Floyd's triumph with The Dark Side of the Moon the contrast is even sharper. Barrett coughs when he's not wheezing, he can hardly strum his guitar, and his lyrics are off-the-wall in a modest, workaday way. David Gilmour and Roger Waters back him up (good for them), but sloppily (good for them again); there's no hint of their engineering-student expertise. Admittedly, a lot of what results is worthy of the wimp-turned-acid-casualty Barrett is. But a lot of it is funny, charming, catchy--whimsy at its best. I love most of side one, especially ""Terrapin"" and ""Here I Go."" And while my superego insists I grade it a notch lower, I know damn well it gives me more pleasure than The Dark Side of the Moon.

FALSE,B,David Barretto,David Barretto,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11692,"
If you don't believe a Fats Domino medley is likely to go with something called ""Time to Sow the Seed,"" featuring not one but two harps, you're like me, and like me you're wrong. This is schlock with a difference, and the difference is faith. Believe me, Shadow Morton can make a believer out of anybody.
"
FALSE,B,Disconnected,Stiv Bators,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4370,"
The power-pop accoutrements are audible through Greg Shaw's cruddy production. But because it soft-pedals Stiv's unfortunate but well-inhabited persona--even the signature ""Evil Boy"" is kinda winsome--the record lacks tension, not to mention a reason to exist.
"
FALSE,B,Dutch,The BBC,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4372,"
Denizens of the Pennyslvania night, these sauerkraut lovers also love MTV, because in Sauerkrautland MTV is another place to get music--music that offers an excuse to do the Dutch, a dance funkier and funnier than you'd figure.
"
FALSE,B,15 Big Ones,The Beach Boys,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3476,"
This is their best album since Sunflower, which is their best of this decade. Brian is aboard, if not in charge. But Sunflower or Wild Honey it's not. The oldies idea isn't itself the problem. But except for ""Palisades Park"" and ""A Casual Look"" the choices might have been more inspired, and the playful, goofy vocal intensity of the black music covers of their youth is often missing. I can deal with the Maharishi stuff by now--it simply underlines the group's public transformation from super-normals into harmless eccentrics--but never again should they commit an I-love-music song. In the current example, rock evolves from the Gregorian chant, an idea I do not consider a harmless eccentricity.
"
FALSE,B,The Beat,The Beat,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6367,"
In which the Ramones clean up their act and/or the Knack stop smirking. Very nice boys, very intense, twelve songs in half an hour, never stop, drive all over the place, aren't coming home tonight, wanna find a rock and roll girl, don't fit in (but will).
"
FALSE,B,Tales of the New West,The Beat Farmers,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4376,"
Like so many roots bands, they write good songs and cover better ones--even in a nonpurist movement, Velvets-to-Springsteen-to-Spoonful is a broad-minded parlay. And like so many roots bands, their singers aren't sharp enough to bring it together--can't understand the difference between having fun, making fun, and being funny before mixing them up, can't at least be soulful instead of something vaguer, like ""genuine.""
"
FALSE,B,Van Go,The Beat Farmers,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4377,"
Except for the deadpan ""Gun Sale at the Church"" and maybe the Johnny Cash impressions, their country-rock is now proudly generic. In a world of lame concepts this approach is jake with me, and if their sharpest song originated with Neil Young, well, they didn't write the flattest one either.
"
FALSE,B,Sea Change,Beck,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11734,"
How painful the calculation to become sincere, how arduous the labor to find one's ease. Nobody's saying he isn't talented, and there are some fetching tunes here. But when the most impressive thing about slow songpoetry is the string writing, somebody doesn't have his heart in it, and even if it's not his fault 'cause he doesn't have one, his dolor ends up as cold as his funk. For some that's the idea--a little affectlessness helps the prettiness go down. But whatever irony diehards believe, emotion and intelligence aren't mutually exclusive. Any argument to the contrary calls for active resistance.
"
FALSE,B,Flash,Jeff Beck,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8206,"
With his customary focus, loyalty, and consistency of taste, the mercurial guitarist plumbs a ""new"" idea copped from such innovators as Foreigner and Duran Duran--funk-metal fusion. Pitting Rod Stewart (on a convincing if utterly context-free ""People Get Ready"") and Arthur Baker (out to produce Foreigner and Duran Duran and apt to do a damn good job of it) against Wet Willie's vocalist and Cactus's drummer, he nevertheless turns in the best LP of his pathologically spotty career by countenancing Nile Rodgers's production on five tracks. So what do we have here? We have half a good Nile Rodgers album, more or less.
"
FALSE,B,Children of the World,Bee Gees,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6379,"
Their closed-system commitment to a robot aura renders embarrassing questions about whether they mean what they're singing irrelevant, which is good. Too often, though, their pleasure in artifice doesn't wholly irradiate the rather patchy material. Best hook: Blue Weaver's organ part on ""Subway.""
"
FALSE,B,Strong Weakness,The Bellamy Brothers,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8208,"
The problem with the lesser songs of these country slickers isn't that they're too dumb--it's that they're not dumb enough. I love their harmonies, but I prefer to keep their minds at a safe distance.
"
FALSE,B,Back Home,Chuck Berry,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6389,"
Like the reconstructed ""Reelin' and Rockin'"" that opens side two, most of Berry's return to the label of his glory days is tasty, real rockin', and inessential. Also included, however, are two of his greatest songs ever: ""Tulane,"" as canny a take on hippiedom (which Chuck has been struggling to comprehend since he first played the Fillmore) as ""Sweet Little Sixteen"" is on high school, and its sequel, ""Have Mercy Judge,"" the first major blues this supposed bluesman has ever written. History, anyone?
"
FALSE,B,I Am . . . Sasha Fierce,Beyoncï¿,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14342,"
In truth, there are three good songs on this 11-track artifact, and deeply vapid though the split-personality bit is, the trick of dividing the album into two CDs does leave a 17-minute dance disc that can be played without gastric distress by any purchaser who isn't picky about diva gangstaism or videophone porn. But me, I'm a hater, and thus I'm something like outraged, by not just those two pimp-outs but an ""Ave Maria"" lacking even the dumbstruck literalism of Pink's rendition or the grotesque conversion of ""Umbrella"" into ""Halo."" Interpreted autobiographically, this halo seems to adorn Jay-Z, who elsewhere inspires little romantic realism or romantic bliss in his bride. In fact, two of the good songs are rather hard on Jeezy's gender, and mine. When in the third Be claims she's in love with her radio, you can only wonder at her determination to live in the past.
"
FALSE,B,Cosmic Thing,B-52's,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=206,"
AIDS having robbed them of their most essential musician, this is an almost touchingly brave attempt to dance away from the edge of ecocatastrophe. Earthquakes, tidal waves, bushfires, waste dumps, toxic fog, maybe even that Chrysler big as a whale are counterposed to and in theory renewed by positive natural forces--junebugs, spaceships, cosmic vibes, an expanding universe, poor rebellious kids having innocent fun. They're trying to be seriously silly, and they're right to believe serious silliness is a healer. But between Ricky Wilson's guitar and the permanent defeat his loss doesn't merely signify, they can't quite bring it off. It's enough to make a grown man cry.
"
FALSE,B,The Hammer Party,Big Black,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4389,"
One side the 1983 Ruthless EP Lungs, the other the 1984 Ruthless EP Bulldozer, and if you think Steve Albini is less than profound now, here's where you shore up your belief in progress. ""Steelworker"" presages ""Deep Six""'s gothic fantasies about the working class (or is it just guys with muscles?). ""Pigeons"" is a cute bit about an oppressed teenager whose mom makes him kill feathered rodents. Beyond that it's sound and fury.
"
FALSE,B,Lullabies Help the Brain Grow,Big Boys,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4390,"
If this exemplary hardcore unit can't quite break their LP into the general-interest zone, I begin to wonder whether the new punks are ever going to reach anyone with a full head of hair. The Big Boys are far from monolithic, cutting the blur with ballad tempos and funk rhythms and even horns. Randy Turner's mock my-voice-is-changing squeal has an old (white) blues singer's authority. And their unmistakable heart in no way softens the ranting fury that's the signature of the style. But without a guitar ace (Bad Brains) or a songwriter (Descendents) or both (Black Flag), they cross over only at their best--about six cuts out of fourteen here, including the two slowest.
"
FALSE,B,The Crossing,Big Country,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4392,"
With its bagpipe guitars and Celtic blues lines, Stuart Adamson's Skids-U2 hybrid avoids any hint of rock purism. Although ""Chance"" is the only fully realized song here, the rest sound good from a distance. But I wish Adamson didn't sing like Colonel Bryan Bowie and, even worse, write like Bishop Kahlil Masefield. Regaled with martial rhythms, I always feel safer knowing exactly what the war's about.
"
FALSE,B,A Luta Continua,Big Youth,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4396,"
First side's the usual homiletics--broad-minded as ever, musicianly rather than dubwise, and nothing his fans need to know. But on side two he gets mad, savoring the phrase ""shit-eating grin"" on ""K.K.K."" and livelying up the tenacious militance of the title track with Afrobeat horns. This is what college radio ought to be for.
"
FALSE,B,The Mysterious Production of Eggs,Andrew Bird,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13177,"
The main reason this record isn't insufferable is that Bird never preens. He shows off discreetly, underplaying his vocal chops and musical command, even his familiarity with scientific arcana--nay, his intelligence itself, which I bet exceeds that of 95 percent of the netcrits his ninth album has had its way with. But discretion exacts a price in identity, clarity, and meaning. The artist may know what these songs signify beyond cunningly arranged wordplay, but anybody else who does ain't talking. Nor does the artist reveal anything about his inner life, specifically including the delight that normally renders the ludic compelling. Certainly there are moments when the music asserts itself--I recommend the chamber-orchestra intro to ""Fake Palindromes."" But in this prog-rock moment, what half saves Bird's mild, pretty, supersmart album is that it doesn't throw the melody out with the rebop.
"
FALSE,B,Tony Bird of Paradise,Tony Bird,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6400,"
Bird hasn't put his strongest material on this record--his debut has more knockout songs (more losers, too), and I once saw him perform a paranoid tribute to the CIA that I'd love to hear again. But he remains such an odd and abrasive singer that he has a right to go a little commercial, and producer John Lissauer knows how.
"
FALSE,B,Juke Joint Jump,Elvin Bishop,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1146,"
Elvin's solo albums started coming out in 1969, but this is the first one this fan ever wanted to hear twice. Nothing spectacular, that would violate his sense of propriety--just rocking with a steady roll, perfect for admirers of Robert E. Lee if a mite laid-back for Broadway Bob. Nice to hear a National Merit Scholar make good.
"
FALSE,B,Goin' Off,Biz Markie,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4397,"
Except for the timeless ""Pickin' Boogers,"" not one of the class clown's hits has the life of ""This Is Something for the Radio,"" which sounds like it was tossed off late one night on ludes: ""We just talkin' over this beat, I don't know what the hell we're doin' . . ."" If you love ""Vapors"" and all those songs with Biz's name in the title but not the credits, figure I'm nitpicking. If come to think of it you don't, wonder yet again how long a street genre can survive high-intensity commodification.
"
FALSE,B,Jealous Again,Black Flag,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4399,"
Black Flag are committed to rage, not in itself--I don't believe their ""I've got something personal against you"" even though I know it's true--but as a musical principle. Five songs, seven minutes, as arty as no wave, with a comparable relationship to punk precedents, which for L.A. are basic Brit. The sound is extreme and unique, all forced rhythm and guitar blur with no ingratiating distractions--no humor, irony, hooks, or (God knows) melody. Well, maybe irony.
"
FALSE,B,Everything Went Black,Black Flag,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4400,"
Stuck in legal limbo, they resort to historic alternate-take arcana featuring the three screamers who passed through the band before Henry Rollins took possession--except for side four, which is filled with radio ads for Flag gigs. These are still collector-only, I suppose. But as punk-era Firesign Theatre, worth going out and flattering a geek with a skateboard to hear.
"
FALSE,B,City Slicker,J. Blackfoot,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4403,"
""The Way of the City"" and ""Street Child"" and ""Where Is Love"" and the not-quite-dumb-enough ""One of Those Parties"" don't sound like a country boy's response to the city--they sound like an unreconstructed soul journeyman giving weary moderns everywhere cheap sobs and snickers they might pay for. But as an uneven soul album this scores around 50-50. ""The Way of the City"" is on the up side for its Memphis-New Orleans fusion, one of the few marks of musical development. In the old days soul men usually left tunes as lightly ebullient as ""All Because of What You Did to Me"" to the gals, so that's progress. And the title rap actually does sound like a country boy's response to the city. Inspirational Verse: ""Get the sweetnin' out of gingerbread and never break the crust.""

FALSE,B,Maestra Vida: Primera Parte,Rubï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4409,"
Willie Colon's vocalist has created a salsa album so artistically ambitious that it brooks no comparison--a music drama complete with synopsis and recorded dialogue that purports to sum up half a century of NuYorican struggle. As a non-Spanish-speaker with access to a privately provided trot, I'm impressed with his reach, his grasp, and his acting ability, but as a veteran of rock opera I feel constrained to note that these things rarely work as planned even when the audience knows the language. Since I'm no salsa expert, I can only observe that both the studied casualness of the production style--songs over backtalk, impromptu-sounding chorus--and the musical-comedy overture seem more effective dramatically than musically. Still, the context helps makes salsa accessible to the nonexpert. And it's possible Blades isn't just smarter than the Neon Philharmonic--he could be smarter than, gosh, Pete Townshend himself.
"
FALSE,B,Maestra Vida: Segunda Parte,Rubï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4410,"
On a major label, this would have been disc two of a double-LP, relieving us of another overture. But the rock world rarely produces a song as physically beautiful (or solicitously observed) as ""Carmelo, Despuï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"" Too many violins and not enough clave. But his heart and his head are in the right place.
"
FALSE,B,Nothing but the Truth,Rubï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4412,"
Although familiarity has tempered my dismay, my first response to Blades's assault on Anglophonia was embarrassment--just what WEA needed, another Jackson Browne album. Admittedly, it's a pretty good Jackson Browne album, with various class acts (Uncle Lou, Elvis C., Sting, and studio luminaries) pitching in for their (and my) favorite Hispanic liberal. When I suppress my corn immunity I'm moved by the AIDS song, the homeless song, and the barrio song. And except for Sting's contribution, I'm impressed by the rest--literate lyrics about Latin America, feckless idealism, and feckless love are never easy to come by. But that doesn't mean they're easy to bring off, and deprived of Seis del Solar's rolling undercurrents Blades is forced to serve them up straight, a skill he hasn't practiced like he has his English. Not that practice would make perfect--cf. Jackson Browne.
"
FALSE,B,Agua de Luna,Rubï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4411,"
Establishing his progressive credentials and his rock credentials simultaneously, Blades commits two progressive rock errors, relying on synthesizers for texture and literature for aesthetic complexity. It's a measure of his gift and his freedom from pretension that between his supple voice and even suppler groove he induces you to listen to the damn synths--and that the words sound (and translate) like they make sense until you bear down line by line. As I bet Garcia Mï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rquez knows, this kind of compression isn't realistic or mag"
FALSE,B,His California Album,Bobby Bland,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6413,"
With Bland's old label, Duke, which ABC purchased partly to get at his contract, you cut an LP when you score a single. This is a tragically short-sighted way to treat the greatest pure singer in blues, but it does help guarantee that at least one cut will connect instantaneously, like ""That Did It"" on Touch of the Blues or ""Chains of Love"" on Spotlighting the Man. The pop moves here are no more arbitrary than the ones Bland has always gone for. But whether he's sticking to Duke material or inserting a growl into a Barry Goldberg song, he puts his stamp on nothing.
"
FALSE,B,Reflections in Blue,Bobby Bland,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6417,"
Blues is an art of narrow margins, and ABC's production honchos push this too far--their two songs are bores, and every time Michael Omartian touches a keyboard or a chart the record dies a little. Not a lot--I really believe he's doing his best. But though there are good moments on all of the seven remaining tracks, only ""I Intend to Take Your Place""--by Jimmy Lewis, a hidden treasure of contemporary blues and soul songwriting--belongs in Bland's canon.
"
FALSE,B,"Over There: Live at the Venue, London",The Blasters,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4414,"
If you want to give the EP a bad name, stick to bands like Devo and the Chartbusters. These guys are too good for a quickie, but though the songs they choose are classic, they cover them only adequately.
"
FALSE,B,Musique Mecanique,Carla Bley,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=546,"
I'm still attracted to Bley's humor, best displayed here in the title piece, a wry take on the charms and imperfections of the mechanical mode. But this is basically desultory, hinting at the feckless formalism an obsession with textures so often conceals. Beyond the jokes, and the deliberately aborted moments of lyricism, she really doesn't have much to say. Weill sure did. And so did Satie.
"
FALSE,B,Blind Faith,Blind Faith,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10852,"
Perhaps because I expected such miracles from the beginning, I was never turned around by Cream or Traffic, but neither group ever put out a record that didn't contain a track or two that I loved--""I Feel Free"" or ""Paper Sun"" or ""Politician"" or ""Feelin' Alright."" There is nothing here that makes me feel that way: I'm almost sure that when I'm through writing this I'll put the album away and only play it for guests. Unless I want to hear Clapton--he is at his best here because he is kept in check by the excesses of Winwood, who is rapidly turning into the greatest wasted talent in the music. There. I said it and I'm glad.

FALSE,B,The Prophets,Alpha Blondy,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4417,"
Praying that he's Bob Marley, the U.S. major bites. And gets a professional reggae album with the drums too loud, sliding gradually from felt convention to grooveful genericism. Most remarkable thing about it is the dedication, to ""the planet Earth"" and various oddly spelled principals in the battle for Israel.
"
FALSE,B,Tough,Kurtis Blow,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8216,"
The title track breaks out more breaks, ""Baby, You've Got to Go"" makes the most of its bad sexual politics, and the rhythm tributes are rhythmic enough. But even on a five-song mini his speech rhythms wear as thin as his singing, which he still hopes is his future.
"
FALSE,B,America,Kurtis Blow,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4421,"
Blow's pop credibility soared when he finally got one of his precious femme choruses on the radio, ruining the otherwise serviceable ""Basketball"" rap. There's nothing quite so intrusive here, and Blow's singing has come up some--in fact, he's now just what the world needed, another serviceable funk loverboy. Fortunately, he can still talk that talk, and his reunion with Davy DMX makes a lot of noise.
"
FALSE,B,Cross Roads,Sugar Blue,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4423,"
You may remember his harmonica from ""Miss You"" (or if you're lucky Johnny Shines's Too Wet to Plow), but if you figured he could sing at all you didn't guess his voice would be as rich and mellifluous as his harp, more King Pleasure than Little Walter. Nor would you have predicted an existential blues in the style of Mark-Almond.
"
FALSE,B,"No More, No Less",Blue Ash,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6424,"
Magic for new nostalgiacs--the spirit of '66 materializes before your very ears, including ""Any Time at All,"" a good previously unrecorded Dylan song, and an original called ""Smash My Guitar."" Shazam, if that's your idea of a good time.

Leading up to a stirring chorus and going out on a rousing coda (more stirring and rousing on the London import 12-inch, I must report), ""Cath"" is one of those pop strokes that'll show up on anthologies with ""Turning Japanese"" and ""Starry Eyes"" in 2001. Dominic Behan's ""Patriots Game"" shoulda been a Dylan song. ""Everybody's Somebody's Fool"" ain't bad.

There ought to be hundreds of groups like this one--hard, competent, slightly commercial--but there probably aren't more than 20. This is not especially original, but it's good, and I'll bet they're a stone happy gas live.

FALSE,B,Secret Treaties,Blue Oyster Cult,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=357,"
Sometime over the past year, while I wasn't playing their records, I began to wonder whether a cross between the Velvet Underground and Uriah Heep was my idea of a good time. The driving, effortless wit and density of Buck Dharma's guitar flourish in this cold climate, but Eric Bloom couldn't project emotion if they let him, and I'm square enough to find his pseudo-pseudospade cynicism less than funny. Subject of ""Dominance and Submission"": New Year's 1964 in Times Square.

Although Sandy Pearlman used to say the Cult's audience couldn't tolerate any suggestion that the band's laser-and-leathers fooforaw was funny, their parodic side has become progressively more overt. What do today's Cultists think of ""Godzilla"" (""Oh no there goes Tokyo"") or the beerhall intro to ""Golden Age of Leather""? I bet some of 'em like laughing at laser-and-leathers, and good. I also bet some of 'em are so zonked they wouldn't get it if John Belushi emceed, and to, er, hell with them.

FALSE,B,Da-Da,Arthur Blythe,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4426,"
Blythe is a major musician and except for one piece of dinky funk this passes pleasantly enough, but its conceptual confusion epitomizes jazz's commercial impasse. Not only does Blythe play safe every which way, but there's no logic to his successes. You wouldn't figure the synthed-up ballad from Brazilian pop romantic Djavan to generate more atmosphere than the readings from Coltrane and Roland Hanna. Or Kelvyn Bell to provide the album's liveliest moment on the other funk attempt. Or the neat remake of ""Odessa"" to generate respectable heat up against the wild one on 1979's Lenox Avenue Breakdown, back when there was reason to hope Black Arthur would beat this shit.

FALSE,B,Bohannon's Greatest Disco Hits,Hamilton Bohannon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6434,"
I listened a lot to this record on the strength of Vince Aletti's description of Bohannon's ""idiosyncratic style: long (five- to eight-minute), bottom-heavy instrumentals with minimal, chantlike or repetitive vocals framed in a nearly unvarying beat pattern so relentless that it's pushed beyond boredom to fascination. Unlike most successful disco music, Bohannon's has few peaks and almost no breaks. . . . The music's very relentlessness and lack of intensity gives it a strangely dead, `off' quality--just as those outer-space replacements for people in science-fiction movies are always vaguely wrong, emotionless."" I agree, yet somehow I'm not fascinated. On the other hand, I've never thought about it while I was dancing.

FALSE,B,Take the Heat Off Me,Boney M.,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6435,"
As in so much German disco, a nice tart detachment undercuts the lush vacuousness here. It's not just that the rhythms are candidly mechanical; even the stiffness of the string playing sounds calculated, as if produced by some fantastic cuckoo clock. Who else could put ""No Woman, No Cry"" and the Peggy Lee version of ""Fever"" belly-to-belly except some European who thinks that whatever crosses the Atlantic is similarly funky and exotic?
"
FALSE,B,Double Bummer,Bongwater,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4431,"
The whole two-record set teeters on the edge of in-joke, avant-bullshit, and not-for-profit self-indulgence. But where the found tape documentaries w/ neoexpressionist noodling are exactly as interesting as their sources (surreal pre-Watergate Nixon, the standard radio evangelist), Ann Magnuson's rock dreams and Chinese ""Dazed and Confused"" and Monkees cover and straight satirical Tuli Kupferberg chantey have the unjudgmental plasticity of the best camp. Can't quite claim she's worth the price of admission--a talent to watch, say.

Over a year ago these people, who then called themselves Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, released their first album, Gorilla. It was weird and annoying and I sold it. Since then they have put in a guest appearance in Magical Mystery Tour and hit small with the title song of this LP. They are still weird and annoying but I'm beginning to believe--sort of an English equivalent of the Mothers, eccentric rather than freaky, without Zappa's musical ambition or (hence) his pretensions and much superior to the other English-eccentric groups (the Deviants, the Scaffold). Not good rock, God knows. But good something.

FALSE,B,Let's Dance,David Bowie,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=963,"
Anyone who wants Dave's $17 million fling to flop doesn't understand how little good motives have to do with good rock and roll. Rodgers &amp; Bowie are a rich combo in the ways that count as well as the ways that don't, and this stays up throughout, though it's perfunctory professional surface does make one wonder whether Bowie-the-thespian really cares much about pop music these days. ""Modern Love"" is the only interesting new song, the remakes are pleasantly pointless, and rarely has such a lithe rhythm player been harnessed to such a flat groove. Which don't mean the world won't dance to it.

FALSE,B,The Last of the Mohicans,Bow Wow Wow,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4443,"
This Kenny Laguna-produced attempt to convince the record company that Annabella is Joan Jett opens with a cover of the Strangeloves' ""I Want Candy"" that isn't as pointless as one might wish--Annabella being female, the oral metaphors instantly evoke toffee-on-a-stick, and don't think Malc doesn't know it. There's also the nubile ""Louis Quatorze,"" remade in what would be record time for anybody but Malc. And three more sexual fantasies, the most outrageous (and sexiest) of which concerns a consensual gang bang. Unfortunately, Annabella's Debbie Harry impression on that one doesn't convince me she's of age.

FALSE,B,Dimensions,The Box Tops,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10854,"
My weakness for lead singer Alex Chilton is admitted, but this really is the group's best album, a goldmine of ambiguities for nascent producer theorists. I have to grant that Chilton's ""I Shall Be Released"" isn't up to Cocker, Makeba, Simone, or the Band, but that the group should do it at all, as a single, yet . . . Also, dig ""Midnight Angel."" Charged a notch because Bell didn't even bother to list Chilton, much less provide us with the names of the studio musicians who impersonate the group on those sessions.

The lead voice of the band that changed Paul Simon's life isn't a voice, it's a rather thin and monotonous alto saxophone, devoid of vibrato or growl--though if the unidentified player had the personality of, say Oliver Lake, he'd still be overmatched by any of dozens of South African singers you can hear. Ain't all that much going on below, either. Take it one cut at a time.

FALSE,B,Workers Playtime,Billy Bragg,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4452,"
He's got a way with a tune and even some money. So maybe it's time to wonder why he has such big problems. Why are women always rejecting him? And why are the people always rejecting him? Not completely, of course--he's a modest success. But in both arenas he falls far short of his putative expectations, and I smell a reason in the barely concealed sob he can't get rid of. From unjust justice all the way to hopeless love, the catch in the throat is kind of seductive--until it starts to stink. This is the voice of a man who expects defeat--not only does he feel born to lose, but he doesn't have what it takes to throw a good wake. So why should the working class follow him to the crossroads? Why should Mary?

FALSE,B,Electronic Eden,The Brains,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4453,"
Put in enough time with this one and despite its dull initial impact every track will give up a hook--a dull hook, perhaps, but in these brite days there's a kind of satisfaction in that. The problem is that the hooks don't connect to much--when the most memorable lyric on the follow-up is about how that guy has got her hypnotized, you begin to wonder just what money has changed, and how.

FALSE,B,The Ascension,Glenn Branca,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4454,"
Okay, so he makes hot ""experimental"" (""serious"") (""classical"") (""new"") music. What we wanna know is whether it's cool rock and roll (""rock""). Not by me. It's great sonically, with ringing overtones that remind me of a carillon or the Byrds, but the beat's overstated and the sense of structure (i.e. climax) mired in nineteenth-century corn. This can be endearing in Pete Townshend or Bruce Springsteen (maybe even opera), but it sounds weak-minded in an artist of such otherwise austere means.

The idea that Sabina Sciubba is sexy and sophisticated assumes that one finds sophistication sexy. Many do, of course, especially when shows of sensuality sweeten the deal.

Hyped into what may be the least label-profitable quintuple-platinum album of all time, this is the confirmation of everything Garth-haters believe. But for those with the heart for his avid ways, what happens is an old alchemical switch--where before he channeled his drive to succeed into the emotion of the song, transmuting his ambition as he intensified his music, now his loony need to maintain his unreal numbers distorts material that would be better off without him, or at least it. Not counting ""Two Piï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"" (Jimmy Buffett, get outta his way), the songs are exceptional, but hearing past the gulping self-parody of his ""interpretations"" takes so much out of you that it's hard to tell. If that means the perfect divorce song ""She's Gonna Make It"" is lost to history, NOW should lodge a protest--or work out some kind of cross-promotion, I don't know.

Great stuff on the two good sides--tricky horn charts, ""Please, Please, Please"" with a Spanish accent, law-enforcement advice. Then there's the side of ballads w/strings, which might be all right if they were also w/voice, and the side that begins ""I Can't Stand It '76.""

FALSE,B,Hot,James Brown,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6477,"
This record has a bad rep. Most of it was reportedly cut with arranger Dave Matthews by New York studio musicians and then dubbed over by JB, and the title hit didn't do as well among blacks as David Bowie's ""Fame,"" where its guitar lick first went public. But side one really works. If Brown did cop that lick, he certainly had it coming, and except for the sodden ""So Long"" everything else is touched with the extraordinary, from the cracked falsetto that climaxes ""For Sentimental Reasons"" to the stirring male backup on ""Try Me"" to ""The Future Shock of the World,"" a high-echo rhythm track on which JB does nothing but whisper the word ""disco."" Unfortunately, the dance vamp and ballads overdisc are nothing new, though ""Please, Please, Please"" (with more male backup) sounds fine in its umpteenth version.

Fact is, he hasn't known what to do with his reality, originality, genius, and so forth since the mid-'70s, when disco took the bump out of the JB funk that made modern dance music possible. Though after years of floundering he figured out the new groove, Brad Shapiro still had to show him the ins and outs of its glitz; now that young dance musicians have reacted back to JB funk, cramming and twisting its bottom while running poesy across the top, he needs Full Force (who like Shapiro aren't true genre insiders, just pros who can take the genre to the bridge) to hip him to its lore. Raps and hooks are nothing special. But whether it's live or Memorex, the dense hostility of the drum attack is both fresh and in the tradition--his tradition.

The goal of Pete's bold request is of course his bedroom. That's where he keeps his synthesizers, pianos, drums, and tape machines, and what he has in mind for you is some guitar or maybe a little background singing. Who needs discos, except to finance the next one? Fantasy love affair indeed.

In which the spirit and guts of Joy of Cooking, united for maybe the last time (Toni has left to record solo with another label), go to Nashville for some country-fried. Needless to say, they've never enjoyed more professional backing, but especially in Nashville there is a well-known problem with professionals--they never push a song that extra notch. And at least half of these could use the help. Shouldn't be lost: ""Midnight Blues.""

FALSE,B,Jackson Browne,Jackson Browne,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6487,"
Many people I like like Browne. Me, I don't dislike him. The voice is pleasant, present, and unpretentious, and when I listen assiduously I perceive lyrics crafted with as much intelligence and human decency as any reasonable person could expect. Unfortunately, only critical responsibility induces me to listen assiduously. It's not just the blandness of the music, but of the ideas as well, each reinforcing the other. Even the meticulously structured requiem ""Song for Adam"" interests me more for the quality of Browne's concern than for its philosophical conclusions. When Bob Dylan's good, I admire him as much as I do William Carlos Williams. I admire Jackson Browne as much as, oh, John Peale Bishop, whose name hasn't entered my mind since I was an English major.
"
FALSE,B,For Everyman,Jackson Browne,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6488,"
The singer-songwriter folk are lining up behind this one as album of the year, but though I'm intrigued by Janet Maslin's suggestion that Browne fuses New York and California sensibilities, sometimes I'm afraid all she means is that he can read. Even as he lists toward the pretentious and the vague, the reflective evenness of Browne's delivery sets up an expectation of cogency that on this album is satisfied only by such relatively unambitious songs as ""These Days,"" ""Red Neck Friend,"" and the charming ""Ready or Not."" Which save it for me.
"
FALSE,B,The Pretender,Jackson Browne,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6490,"
This is an impressive record, but a lot of the time I hate it; my grade is an average, not a judgment. Clearly Jon Landau has gotten more out of Browne's voice than anyone knew was there, and the production jolts Ol' Brown Eyes out of his languor again and again. But languor is Browne's best mask, and what's underneath isn't always so impressive. The shallowness of his kitschy doomsaying and sentimental sexism is well-known, but I'm disappointed as well in his depth of craft. How can apparently literate people mistake a received metaphor like ""sleep's dark and silent gate"" for interesting poetry or gush over a versifier capable of such rhyming dictionary pairings as ""pretender"" and ""ice cream vendor"" (the colloquial term, JB, is ""ice cream man"")? Similar shortcomings flaw the production itself--the low-register horns on ""Daddy's Tune"" complement its somber undertone perfectly, but when the high blare kicks in at the end the song degenerates into a Honda commercial. Indeed, at times I've wondered whether some of this isn't intended as parody, but a sense of humor has never been one of Browne's virtues.
"
FALSE,B,Lives in the Balance,Jackson Browne,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4471,"
These antiwar songs give him plenty in common with Holly Near--he even puts nueva canciï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n musicians on the title track. While Browne goes in for higher octane folk-rock, I'll pass on the remixes if you don't mind. The difference is that Browne shouldn't be doing this--however goody-goody his fans or political his recent rep, he's a pop star who's stretching his audience and endangering his market share merely by making such a statement in 1986. And he's thought hard getting here--not only does his way with words render these lyrics somewhat deeper than Holly Near's, but his moralistic put-downs have that edge of "

Perverse as it may seem, Buckley's mannered, androgynous moan has real erotic appeal for some, and here it turns a trick. This is rock pornography if anything is, complete with whips, foot fetishes, meat racks, and salacious gasps, and while I wouldn't call the band hard-core, it definitely fills the groove.

FALSE,B,A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean,Jimmy Buffett,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6498,"
My shit detector went crazy the moment I spied the admiring apostrophe by sports novelist Tom McGuane, and indeed, Buffett shares McGuane's sexism (he likes Key West because ""the ladies aren't demanding there""), covert nostalgia, reverse preciousness, and brain-proud know-nothingism. But his good-old-boys songs are classics of sheer hair, making up for the overt ""They Don't Dance Like Carmen No More"" and the know-somethingish ""Death of an Unpopular Poet."" And a vignette called ""Cuban Crime of Passion"" has Dickensian heart.
"
FALSE,B,Havana Daydreamin',Jimmy Buffett,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6501,"
Undeniably, this romantic individualist has staked out his surf; perhaps it is because his utopian sunland is Florida (rooted in the South) rather than California (headed toward the Orient) that his songs are so adult, skeptical, and closely observed. He doesn't sentimentalize in any obvious sense--the outsiders he sings about (including himself) are neither pitiable victims nor heirs of unacknowledged privilege. But when he essays some lyricism (about his grandfather, say, or the ""so feminine"" mandolin) he becomes totally mawkish, revealing a softheadedness that in the best Hemingway tradition he is careful to conceal most of the time. And upon close analysis this softheadedness extends even to his best lyrics--he is so intent on the day-to-day that he never cultivates an overview. Buffett is singing with new lustre, and I can't bring myself to put this down. But I don't expect to be putting it on much either.
"
FALSE,B,Son of a Son of a Sailor,Jimmy Buffett,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6503,"
Buffett is very good at what he does, and it says a lot for his composing that the two changes of pace by Keith Sykes are the least memorable cuts on the album. But Buffett's band can't quite cut the funny, intelligent good-time music that is his forte. Anyone who gets up and boogies to rock and roll as routine as ""Livingston Saturday Night"" has been shaking ass to whatever came off the bandstand since he or she reached drinking age. On record, there happens to be better and more functional music available.
"
FALSE,B,Guilty!,Eric Burdon/Jimmy Witherspoon,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6510,"
Burdon has a clumsy knack for coming out on the other side of a bad idea--after ""Monterey,"" which was just silly, ""Sky Pilot"" seemed transcendently silly. And while his stint with War symptomized his chronic racial confusion, he gets on quite well with Witherspoon--especially considering that 'Spoon is said to represent Kansas City class while Eric supposedly epitomizes Newcastle nowhere. Maybe the truth in both cases is less extreme. Anyway, neither singer comes up with anything definitive here, but both deal soulfully--sometimes almost indistinguishably--with these solid, politically tinged songs, and a sharp young guitarist named John Sterling provides a few highlights.
"
FALSE,B,Proud Mary,Solomon Burke,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10833,"
Solid and soulful as always. Self-produced in Muscle Shoals, it's not quite up to his Atlantic stuff, but close enough. Includes a strong rendition of ""That Lucky Old Sun,"" usually a death-trap (especially for black singers) because it's been done so often. That took balls, so I won't charge him for being slightly under time: 29:25.
"
FALSE,B,Dry and Heavy,Burning Spear,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6515,"
The sweetness of Winston Rodney's vocals here is surprisingly acute--especially on the unselfrighteous nonviolence sermon ""Throw Down Your Arms,"" the generalized love song ""Any River,"" and the title cut, an impressionistically spaced-out reminiscence of his schooldays. But despite the welcome crib sheet I don't find that any of the other tracks holds my attention. That's the way it is with sweetness.
"
FALSE,B,Live,Burning Spear,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=506,"
Top material at Jamaican tempos for a London audience of 2000. But as usual the ceremonial extensions, while appropriate formally, call out for the physical presence of fellow worshippers. And would sound more lifelike in a studio.

Strange to hear it come down to material in a singer so infused with the spirit. But what I remember is what I don't remember--the difference between the first three songs, ""African Teacher"" and ""African Postman,"" and ""Cry Blood Africans,"" except that the last one has crying in it. Maybe it's the well-known positivity problem, because when he's angry he comes across: Columbus was a ""damn blasted liar"" indeed.

FALSE,B,Mistress Music,Burning Spear,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=509,"
This kicks off with one of Spear's strongest and strangest songs--""Tell the Children,"" which rather than inculcating them with doctrine informs them she's their mother but Spear's not their father. What's the mystical symbolism, one wonders. Answer: there is none. With the third song called ""Woman I Love You"" and the fifth all ""Girl I love you,"" I guess this is just music for his mistress--or to be precise, mistresses.

FALSE,B,Hounds of Love,Kate Bush,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4489,"
Just as her music says she hopes everyone does, I respect and like this woman. Though it's tempting to slot her with Laura Nyro, you never get the sense she's a fool--she's more circa-Hejira Joni Mitchell. Her best songs can't match their best, but sonically she's magnificent, out-stripping her art-rock mentors, and it would be churlish to deny her to audiophiles and/or young women seeking independent role models. Nevertheless, to be a Romantic with a capital R in 1986 is to be a Victorian like Tennyson, who provides Bush her epigraph. It is deliberately to cultivate a sensibility whose time you know perfectly well has passed.
"
FALSE,B,The Sensual World,Kate Bush,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4490,"
The longing for contact and obliteration are themes grand enough to support a little grandiosity, and because she's smarter than the average art-rocker, she brings something worth telling to them--even something worth ""expressing."" She knows herself better, too; typical that her roots move is Trio Bulgarka rather than some Afro-source having nothing to do with who she is. Just wish she convinced me the Trio Bulgarka had more to do with who I am. The title song could give Henry James a boner. The one where her beloved turns into Hitler is art-rock.

FALSE,B,Nothing Says I Love You Like I Love You,Jerry Butler,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6520,"
This is indeed the Ice Man's best LP since he last recorded with Gamble-Huff in 1970--seductive, substantial, felt. But only the dance cut, ""Cooling Out,"" with Leon Huff heating up on piano toward the close, is really worth playing for people you don't care about going to bed with.

FALSE,B,Better Days,Paul Butterfield,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6523,"
Butterfield's new band--a Woodstock roots-blues supergroup of honest men singing honest songs--is his clearest concept since 1965. Unfortunately, the music is so relaxed it sounds as if they decided--collectively, of course--that laid back meant lying down.

FALSE,B,Live Pcppep,The Butthole Surfers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3512,"
At first I detected an emotional power signifying something more than an arty posthardcore band whose outrageousness was truly original. But soon I noticed that one of the three new songs--striking statistic in a band whose recorded output comprises two longish EPs--was a noise interlude. So now I'm wondering whether they mightn't be an original posthardcore band whose outrageousness is truly arty, or whose emotional power is truly a fake. Oh well--at least they'll evolve toward big-beat no wave (performance art?) rather than heavy metal.

Subtitle: ""Electronic Fantasies for Patriotic Synthesizer."" Further description by artist: ""This album is a series of aural and spatial fantasies evoking the spirit of American patriotic music."" I quote because I can't think of a way to say it better myself, a symptom of my failure to connect with these great old tunes despite my admiration for both the pride and humor of the concept and the confidence of the execution. The abstractness here may be appropriate--is appropriate--but that doesn't mean it isn't alienating. All lovers of American music should try to hear this record. But not even the ""Internationale,"" which Byrd managed to sneak in somehow, moves me to wave the flag for it.

If their first greatest hits was (in Paul Williams's deathless phrase) ""an essay into rediscovery,"" this one's a product into recouping. Thing is, a good statement could have been constructed. Let Notorious and Sweetheart stand on their own (though one song apiece is acceptable anyway), leave the anachronistic ""He Was a Friend of Mine"" in the dustbin of history, and tell Skip Battin to make his own album. Then pick a few more cuts--""Deportee,"" ""Old Blue,"" ""Child of the Universe""--from Easy Rider and Dr. Byrds. Presto: Roger McGuinn's Greatest Quirks.

Having turned soul artist just as the style was going out of fashion, he's now earned a following in Africa and the Caribbean, and more power to him. As you might have guessed from the title, this isn't up to the standard of Sex and Soul--strings, thinner material. But it's quirky and basic, with witty horn charts and a vocal attack that now seems pleasantly anachronistic. Killer cut: Roy shoots a friend who's in bed with Roy's wife and is inspired to the moral reflection that now he's ""in a whole lot of trouble.""

After years of combatting pretentiousness we discover that unpretentiousness can be just as bad. These murmured blues meditations are so easy on the spirit that even though they have their charms they invite the mistrust of moralizers like myself--there's just too much talent here to justify such slight results. Or maybe there isn't enough talent to justify such minimal effort--only if all the songs were as absolutely beguiling as the side-openers, ""Call Me the Breeze"" and ""Crazy Mama,"" would the lassitude affected by all hands be as comfortable for us as I'm sure it was for them. Push a little, fellas, it'll feel so good.
"
FALSE,B,Really,J.J. Cale,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6533,"
Cale outdoes such self-created white bluesmen as John Hammond by writing songs that are locked up in the conventions of the form, designed solely as carriers of pulse and mood. His slurred, whispering vocals and slurred, stuttering guitar are stylistic constants, and his lyrics aspire to the meaning-free universality of the traditional blues tropes and phrases. Mesmerizing, in its way. But the very best blues simply aren't meaning-free or locked up formally--John Hammond selects his repertoire for variety and interest, as does Lightnin' Hopkins, so why shouldn't Cale? Even if his style were as distinctive and forceful as any of dozens I could name, the fact that he consciously chooses his limits robs them of their natural aura. No surprise that the most gratifying tracks here break the mold with a little mystery--especially ""Playing in the Streets,"" with its infusions from Vassar Clements.

There must be more straightforward ways of imperiling the academy than mock-classical mock-soundtracks. Granted, this sounds jake to me, and my continental friends tell me it's excellent of its sort. But I don't much care for the continent (or the sort)--that's why I had to ask them. Rock and roll: ""The Philosopher,"" for acoustic guitar, brass, woodwinds, and (eventually) violins over strange percussion, and ""Days of Steam,"" which reminds me of the Ernie Kovacs theme.

""Military intelligence isn't what it used to be,"" Cale intones on a title cut replete with slash and yowl. ""So what--human intelligence isn't what it used to be either."" Speak for yourself, John. This material, based in part on Cale's recent inquiries into foreign affairs, is fairly strong in a geocynical way that's a lot newer to rock than it is to human discourse in general. But the live recording, while no doubt economical, gets more flash than slash out of Marc Aaron's guitar and not enough singing out of Cale. And ""Captain Hook,"" the dumbest song on the record, lasts 11:26.

Almost universally dismissed as a lysergic self-indulgence, the departed Spirit's tunefully distorted guitar (and vocal) showcase will grow on you if you give it half a chance--any Joe Walsh fan who lets it get by never really liked the '60s to begin with. For sheer dense weirdness it beats King Fripp, and if I had any passion for such things I'm sure I'd love it. Like most of side one a lot as it is. And where else are you going to find covers of ""Rain,"" ""Mother and Child Reunion,"" and current James Brown on one album?

Funkateers think this is ""new wave"" not just because the title hit sounds like the B-52's but because secret virtuoso Larry Blackmon keeps the groove stripped down and off balance. Unfortunately, the hooks are few, the humor is forced, and the ballads suck. For theoreticians mostly.

Larry Blackmon's a funny drummer, and I wouldn't say albums are something he just gets away with.

Like so many dread heartthrobs, this long-ago Black Uhuru co-founder loves Jah more than Woman, which whatever its limits sure beats hating Woman. In the hallowed reggae tradition, the melodies all seem to have been written by the same gifted five-year-old, who wins gold stars only for ""Music Crave"" and ""Spread Out."" But his way of taking off from a simple refrain gives reggae's religious impulse a musical dimension this unbeliever can feel in his soul, or whatever it is.

These songs are catchy and apt (""Don't want no washed-up dishes soft-soaping me,"" eh?), and unlike his pop mentors in Squeeze (he was on board for East Side Story) and Noise to Go (bandmate Nick Lowe produced and helped compose), Carrack seems to Mean It--he's soulful in the manner of somebody like Allan Clarke (of the Hollies, how could you forget?). In fact, I bet his sincerity is the envy of his compulsively ironic co-workers. Unfortunately, it leaves me wondering whether he's a little simple-minded or a minor con man.

Case's problem is that he's a born actor who won't cop to it. Folkies have always enacted authenticity, and great ones from Dylan to Roches have role-played with a vengeance. But by pretending that his songs are about ""sin and salvation"" rather than the more problematic ""America,"" Case evades challenges to his new homespun persona--supposedly, sin and salvation are everybody's heritage.

This ""rock and roll girl"" is a lot more confident, clever, and animated than such Northern counterparts as Ellen Foley and Ellen Shipley, but she's a fairly one-dimensional conservative compared to Pearl E. Gates or Chrissie Hynde. Not only does she never question what she wants, which I guess is OK, but she still equates rock and roll itself with liberation, which isn't.

She's still too solemn, but at least she's not too tasteful, and how else do you describe a musician who gives the impression of singing solo with her acoustic guitar while deploying five or six musicians a track?

As satisfying as Charles's first c&amp;w records were conceptually and vocally, I was always a little turned off by his countrypolitan taste for strings and choruses, and they're still with us--more muted, but also more prosaically arranged, except on the godawful ""Good Morning Dear."" Still, the first side is pure Charles country--eccentric and sexy, which real country rarely is, and funny as only Charles can be.

Two decades ago, on Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Charles transfigured pop, prefigured soul, and defined modern country &amp; western music. This return to a symbolic Nashville (recorded in his own L.A. studio, natch, though unlike 1970's Love Country Style it leans more heavily on banjo-mandolin-steel than on Sid Feller's strings) celebrates his latest contract with yet another rehash of his jokey, deeply felt shtick. Not that it can't be great shtick. But he's always better off grabbing other people's classics than trying to create new ones from scratch, and I bet he's got publishing on three or four of the songs you never heard of.

Nor am I shocked that they're not as powerful as the Aerosmith of Rocks, Jack Douglas or no Jack Douglas. But given their harmony singing you think they'd try and be more melodic.

FALSE,B,Out West,Clifton Chenier,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6571,"
As the king of the accordion-based Louisiana blues known as zydeco, Chenier is revered among such patrons of the folk as Arhoolie's Chris Strachwitz, who has now recorded six albums with him. This is a good thing, I guess, but Chenier strikes me most of the time as a big frog in a small bayou--in French or English his slurs and impassioned moaning are pretty automatic, and the most distinctive thing about his accordion playing is that he plays accordion. This album adds Bay Area guitarist Elvin Bishop and pianist Steve Miller to Chenier's six-piece lineup, and I welcome the impurities--Miller is nothing special, but Bishop's solos give Chenier room to breathe and something to test his strength against. The only loss is Cleveland Chenier's counterrhythms on rubboard, which sink into the mix, but with Arhoolie that's always a danger anyway.

It's OK that producer-singer-songwriter Eugene Record has written an entire album for the male supplicant he created. But it's not OK that except for the folk-kitsch masterpiece ""Oh Girl"" (a/k/a ""Oh That Harmonica"") not one of these songs is going to get him what he wants--true love, a roll in the hay, a hit single, anything. Nor is it okay that he bids fair to turn into the falsetto Isaac Hayes on ""A Lonely Man"" (a/k/a ""Have You Seen Her Yet"") and ""The Coldest Days of My Life"" (a/k/a ""The Longest Song I've Ever Written"").

They're still a better-than-average harmony group, but their moment is past, and although they continue to handle brisk tempos more deftly than the competition their accommodations to disco are just that--compromises, not expansions. Eugene Record's lyrics offer more than the music, which he often farms out these days: ""A Letter to Myself"" is classic silly self-pity, I leave it to your to imagine how ""Homely Girl"" turns out, and ""That's How Long"" (which Record didn't write) is as graphic a song as has ever made 54 in Billboard.

Right, this bag of wrecked covers and discarded originals is, what's it say here, ""self-indulgent."" If Keith Richards or Rat Scabies were to dare such a thing, I'd throw it in the garbage myself. But that don't take nothing away from ""Baron of Love, Pt. II""--the opening cut, in which composer Ross Johnson raves distractedly about sex and gore. Or the line about nipples in ""Rock Hard."" A very bright music nut who knows from the inside how much craziness goes into the most normal-seeming product (he did front the Box Tops, remember), this long-time advertisement for self-abuse doesn't prove craziness is universal. Just makes you forget that things most certainly wouldn't be more fun if it was.

FALSE,B,Remote Luxury,The Church,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4538,"
I see these Aussies as the wimp Del Fuegos--musically they wind up just where they want and epistemologically they go next to nowhere. All right, so the songs are quite pretty in a modernized early-Faces/late-Zombies kind of way--more consistently so than the '60s competition (which gives them a leg up on the Fuegos, who like the macho boys they are take on the Stones). I even get the point: the sweet, melancholy alienation the band cultivates is an attractive alternative to the crass pragmatism and/or self-righteous nihilism of their contemporaries. But where my own fave formalists the Shoes are honest enough to focus their lyrics on the very limited social milieu essential to the nurture of such alternatives, these guys evade specifics via metaphor and have the presumption to reproduce their hazy poetry on the inner sleeve. Which may help explain why the music sometimes almost drifts away.

Anybody who can't hear this album's pretty textures and expert hooksmanship has problems with his or her central nervous system. I mean, facts are facts.

One great r&amp;b instrumental (""Slunky""), two tracks that deserve classic status (""After Midnight"" and ""Let It Rain""), two that don't (""Bottle of Red Wine"" and ""Blues Power""), and well-played filler. I blame a conceptual error, rather than Clapton's uncertain singing, for the overall thinness. As a sideman, Clapton slipped into producer Delaney Bramlett's downhome bliss as easily as he did into Cream's blues dreamscape, but as a solo artist he can't simulate Delaney's optimism. I mean, a party song called ""Blues Power"" from a man with a hellhound on his trail?

A number of worthwhile oddities on this stopgap pseudo-document: the uptempo, high-echo, Spector-produced single of ""Tell the Truth,"" a studio jam on the same tune, and King Curtis's ""Teasin',"" featuring God on novelty guitar. Also some less worthwhile oddities, a lot of Cream and Delaney &amp; Bonnie, and not enough showpieces from the Yardbirds and Bluesbreakers days (those are on other labels, which means they cost money). Yet it's gone top ten. Must be a lot of collectors out there. Or maybe just people who believe in God.

FALSE,B,The South Coast of Texas,Guy Clark,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4546,"
Clark is hardly the last surviving singer-songwriter, but so much of the competition has gotten into rock auteurism or pop demos that those who miss the old ways pay him more mind than they used to. This is his best since 1975's aptly titled Old No. 1. The ""Rita Ballou"" lets us know he's singing easier, and turns like ""her breath's as sweet as chewing gum"" and ""the road to good intentions/Is paved with the fools that I've been"" remind us of his vernacular knack. But only on ""New Cut Road,"" real bluegrass canonfodder, does the music add meaning as well as tangibility. Which is why the competition is into rock auteurism and pop demos.

Not really live, just cut for subsequent broadcast in the studio with small band rather than countrypolitan arsenal. But that's not really the problem--the problem is what and to a lesser extent when. None of these songs were hits for Patsy even though some of them were released as singles, and though career trajectory is no doubt part of the reason, so is quality of material. And though he was good in 1956, she did get better.

Shit-rock iconographer J.D.

It also surprises me, because I never heard or heard of them at a time when I was clubbing three-four times weekly. They sure deserved some word-of-mouth. On the other hand, they weren't deeply special, not on this evidence. This is why critics get a little jaded.

This one features vocals from Merle Haggard (two songs), Willie Whozit (one song), Jack Greene (who sounds like Waylon Whozit), and a dusky-voiced old favorite of mine, Jeannie Seely (Jack's singing partner and Hank's wife). Clinkerless, but way too heavy on the lighthearted throwaways.

FALSE,B,Stealing Fire,Bruce Cockburn,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4556,"
The songs about life and love fade into the usual high-IQ lyricism, but the ones about politics bite and hold. Not just because they're more violent (guns and copters galore) or virtuous (folk-rock Sandinista!)--because they're more specific. It isn't just ideology that makes ""Who put that bullet hole in Peggy's kitchen wall?"" a better lyric than ""Pay attention to the poet/You need him and you know it."" Me, I pay attention to rocket launchers.

Cockburn's a very smart guy with as tough and articulate a line on imperialism as any white person with a label deal. Few singer-songwriters play meaner guitar, and as befits an anti-imperialist he knows the international sonic palette. Unfortunately, his records never project musical necessity. The melodies and/or lyrics carry the first side anyway, but though I'm sure Cockburn has some idea what the synthesized pans are doing on the cry of politico-romantic angst and the vaguely Andean fretboards on the Wasp dub poem, what the world will hear is the oppressive boom-boom of four-four drums.

After listening to two LPs worth of ""Singles 1970-1987"" three times, I'm convinced the miracle he's waiting for is one that transmutes a single into a hit. I'm waiting for his benefit compilation for the Committee in Solidarity With the People of El Salvador.

Where other singers have soul, Cockburn has dudgeon, fiercer and bitterer with every record. Delivering lines like ""don't breathe when the cars go by"" and ""may their gene pool increase"" as if his life depended on them, which before he's dead it could, he reveals rules about the ineluctable bad faith of the political for the know-nothing shibboleths they are. Too bad he still cultivates his ""personal"" side. I await a best-of filled with protest and nothing but.

No, his voice isn't shot, though it's certainly lost a lot of soft edges and warm crannies--a lot of phlegm. Partial compensation provided by the decline of L.A.: there are more good songs lying around than at any time since Cocker and Three Dog Night invented interpretive rock way back when. And Sly &amp; Robbie's loud, fast Memphis beat is the toughest backup of his life.

Anybody who doubts the artiness of L.A. punk purism should check out the London version--where NME-subscribing suburbanites speed up the Pistols, East End oi boys slow them down (just slightly, to about the tempo of a fast football march). Sure the songs blur too much anyway, especially on side two, but the 'tween-verse rave-ups are rousing throughout, ""I'm Not a Fool"" is worthy of 1977, the line after ""Join the Rejects"" is ""And get yourself killed,"" and the toaster-introed ""Where the Hell Is Babylon?"" (""I wanna go"") is an overdue answer song whatever its racial subtext--my only regret is that they didn't slip a dig at the Dolls into it.

I can forgive August Darnell the filler on side one because he's a gifted disco producer, which means his throwaway jingles and premature remakes and cynical trifles add up to dance music that's more listenable than most. But the failures on side two are as unfocused as anything he's ever committed to vinyl--excepting only ""If I Only Had a Brain,"" an all too apt cover for these would-be bimbos.

Cohen's arrangements are even more detailed and surprising than John Lissauer's, and Jennifer Warnes is the most valuable backup singer since Emmylou Harris. ""The Traitor"" is a minor masterpiece. And in general this record's take on courtly love in the swingers' era packs more ironic intelligence than you would have thought possible. Or necessary, unfortunately. Cohen's gift for elementary hummables seems to deteriorate as his writing evolves from the conversational toward the allegorical. Irony or no irony, ""rages of fragrance"" and ""rags of remorse"" sound suspiciously like bad poetry even when they're sung, and that's not now it's supposed to work.

FALSE,B,Dear Heather,Leonard Cohen,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12572,"
I know it's hard to get a grip on, kids, but people keep getting older. They don't just reach some inconceivable benchmark--50 or, God, 60--and stop, Old in some absolute sense. The bones, the joints, the genitals, the juices, the delivery systems, and eventually the mind continue to break down, at an unpredictable pace in unpredictable ways. Leonard Cohen has had No Voice since he began recording at 33. But he has more No Voice today, at 70, than he did on Ten New Songs, at 67--the tenderness in his husky whisper of 2001, tenderness the way steak is tender, has dried up in his whispered husk of 2004, rendering his traditional dependence on the female backups who love him more grotesque. Nor does noblesse oblige underlie all the adaptations and settings--Lord Byron, Patti Page, a Quebecois folk song, various dead Canadian poets, himself. Rather they reflect the same diminished inspiration that makes you wonder whether his 9/11 song is enigmatic or merely inconclusive. Not only do I like the guy, I'm Old enough to identify with him. But I doubt I'll ever be Old enough to identify with this. On her deathbed, my 96-year-old mother-in-law was still relying on Willie Nelson's Stardust. That's more like it.

Things work out all too predictably for this smart young studio duo. Eclectically danceable and righteously segued though their samples are, they're too bare-bones in themselves to move the crowd--the world beyond the dance floor. When a real vocalist climbs aboard--Lisa Stansfield, Queen Latifah, Junior Reid (though not, righteous eclecticism aside, Mark E. Smith)--everything is swinging. And when the music is all beat and concept, it's all beat and concept--though ""Party and party and party and bullshit"" is certainly in the great tradition of postmod self-criticism.

Conceived as a pop alternative to U2 and Radiohead, however, they're an argument for death metal.

In which Bruce Iglauer shoots for a Grammy by setting up his big man with a big band--Jimmy McGriff, Mel Brown, Uptown Horns, the works. They do work, too. But nobody ever mistook Albert for Jimmy Witherspoon, much less Jimmy Rushing--he doesn't have the kind of built-in bullhorn essential to that big effect. As if NARAS will care.
"
FALSE,B,Showdown!,Albert Collins/Robert Cray/Johnny Copeland,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=46,"
Collins gets top billing not just because he's Alligator's man but because this is his album. He takes a solo on all nine cuts where Cray and Copeland are vouchsafed a total of seven, and shares vocals about equally with his costars, both of whom cut him. Not that they're trying--if they were, this would live up to its title. As it is, whether the problem's will or conception or ability, you'll get more fireworks from Lonnie Mack w/Stevie Ray Vaughan.

FALSE,B,Lost in the Ozone,Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=624,"
Cody takes the country-rock idea that good old boys form a secret counterculture to bleary new heights. Uprooted bozos who handle fast cars and hot music (or vice versa) a lot better than wimmin and booze, they're half at home in every renegade country tradition, rockabilly and Western swing and white boogie-woogie. But not one of the four vocalists achieves the hippie-redneck synthesis--they all sound like they flee to one subculture when they get kicked out of the other. And the only time the songwriting reaches the outer atmosphere is on ""Seeds and Stems (Again),"" as close to pure hippie as they get.
"
FALSE,B,Caught in the Act,Commodores,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6615,"
For four songs--two hits, ""Slippery When Wet"" and ""The Bump,"" surrounded by ""Wide Open,"" which earns its reprise, and an instrumental called ""I'm Ready"" that's good enough for a theme--they make a case for their funk. I already believed, but the argument is a lot of fun. For the rest of the album they make a case for their soul. I'd be more inclined to believe if they hadn't bothered.

FALSE,B,Heroes,Commodores,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4576,"
With Lionel Richie turning his attentions to inspirational numbers varying the theme ""Got to Be Together,"" with ""Jesus"" joining William King's ""Mighty Spirit"" for the finale, this is an improvement. For one thing, most of the brotherhood anthems--which avoid the gender-specific, actually, with lots of ""people,"" ""folks,"" and ""y'all""--have a somewhat more rousing beat than ""Three Times a Lady."" And on the fond ""Old-Fashion Love"" and the cold-hearted ""Sorry to Say,"" the brothers remind Lionel that this is still supposed to be a funk band.
"
FALSE,B,Anthology,Commodores,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4578,"
As this summation makes clear, they never quite connected as a pioneering funk band because their secret weapon was Lionel Richie, who does not number funk among his natural gifts. Beyond him they're a cut above the Johnson Brothers. Richie will be better off without them. And they'll be worse off yet without him.

FALSE,B,Electric Circus,Common,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11775,"
Sometimes brave men march off into the swamp and get seriously lost, so let's hope Captain ?uestlove and his s?uad remembered the DEET. Vocal flow's not the problem, and set to the beat-smart fusion lite of Like Water for Chocolate, the humanity of the well-meaning poetry would probably outweigh all the forced similes and sentimental lapses. Outfitted in this music, however, Common's pretensions stand up and do jumping jacks. There are pleasurable rhythm elements, and under the circumstances, the Stereolab cameo is kind of an up. But those are parts. The whole is keybs like golden nacho goo, guitar sticking out like chips, please-not-more codas, and everywhere the angelic twaddle of singing swingles doo-doo.

FALSE,B,Ry Cooder,Ry Cooder,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3059,"
According to his own complaints, which may well be warranted, the world's favorite studio bottleneck is also the man from whom Mick and Keith stole ""Let It Bleed."" Now if only he could sing as good as Mick and Keith maybe he'd put his own blues synthesis across. As it stands, Cooder's singing and projection are so flat they recall the folkie fantasy in which the real blues comes from toothless old men on porches--songs by Tommy Tucker and Fats Waller and even Randy Newman (who gets a lot more out of his own narrow pipes) sound as humble as those by Sleepy John Estes and Blind Willie Johnson. Cooder has two folkie virtues, though--he remembers the Depression and he finds wonderful songs. Alfred Reed's ""How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times as These"" is proof of both.
"
FALSE,B,Boomer's Story,Ry Cooder,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3060,"
Enslaved by the tradition of the new, I prefer the Cooder who rediscovers material I never dreamed existed to the Cooder who replicates Sleepy John Estes and Skip James. Especially since one of the Estes songs he's found is of even more dubious interest than Estes's singing style, while the James instrumental is a confusingly airy interlude between his two most gratifying discoveries: ""Boomer's Story"" and ""Crow Black Chicken."" Bonus: Cooder's impression of John Fahey playing ""Dark End of the Street.""
"
FALSE,B,Chicken Skin Music,Ry Cooder,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3063,"
The title refers to a Hawaiian expression closely allied to ""goose bumps,"" which has to be the most modest instance of hubris on record--I mean, does Ry really believe this is gonna make my skin prickle? Folk eclecticism is a nouveau-jug commonplace, after all, even if most nouveau jugheads do lack Ry's imagination and musicianship, not to mention the capital to dab color from Honolulu and San Antonio onto the same LP.

FALSE,B,"Live at the Harlem Square Club, 1963",Sam Cooke,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4582,"
Some people think live albums capture the essence of rock and roll; I don't even think live shows do. That may be why this record, which yea verily doth document a little-noted aspect of Cooke's amazing career, leaves me mostly tepid. But I blame it on headlong show-band arrangements so single-minded they soon undermine what conceptual interest inheres in the transformation of this seminal crossover teen dream into fit fare for the over-twenty-ones in a Miami r&amp;b club. I like grit as much as the next postprimitivist, but good grit admits interpretive flair just like any other mode--more than Cooke puts into these hits, originally designed to downplay his gritty side.

FALSE,B,Billion Dollar Babies,Alice Cooper,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6627,"
The title's as perfect as the band's latest symbol--a $, its ""S"" transformed into a two-headed snake. No outrage Alice has concocted equals the frank, sweaty greed of his current success. Oddly, though, this blatant profit mechanism is his most consistent album--even the song about (mercy me) necrophilia is tolerable, just like the song about tooth decay. But without a ""School's Out"" or an ""I'm Eighteen""--neither ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" nor ""Elected"" quite makes the grade--there's nothing to tempt anyone back to the new improved filler.
"
FALSE,B,Make My Home Where I Hang My Hat,Johnny Copeland,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4586,"
At the outset Copeland identifies himself as a ""Natural Born Believer,"" then applies himself to the bluesman's dilemma of making that belief come just as naturally to us. On his debut album, an all-star horn section and a quarter century of pent-up ambition put him over, but here he opts for the homey (and perhaps overfamiliar) spontaneity of his road band and instead gets horns and songs that sound half-dead until he mixes in some covers overdisc.
"
FALSE,B,Spaces,Larry Coryell,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6631,"
This match-up with Coryell's British counterpart John McLaughlin--featuring a milestone rhythm section of Chick Corea, Miroslav Vitous, and Billy Cobham--spends too much time constructing tone poems for Barney Kessell and nowhere near enough playing new rock and roll. I know Coryell has lightning fingers and a brain to match and in an abstract way I admire him for it, but what's made him more than an improvising technician is a concept that includes the loud and the vulgar. Here even the inevitable raveup sounds willfully thin, as if Charlie Parker had given up saxophone for piccolo because he wanted to be respectable.

FALSE,B,Taking Liberties,Elvis Costello,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4588,"
OK, twenty more songs, all B sides etc., how could it hold together, but some sentimental part of me is taken with its reflexive passion and half-finished serendipity--this detritus was the work of a punk fellow-traveler, and he'll be missed. ""Girls Talk"" and ""Stranger in the House"" and ""I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea"" are more indelible than Get Happy!! at its happiest, and let me put in a word for all 1:43 of the previously unreleased ""Hoover Factory,"" a punless piece of melancholy throwaway sarcasm that reminds us that he's in this because he's pissed, not because he's glib.

FALSE,B,Spike,Elvis Costello,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1161,"
Paul Whiteman was a bigger star, and though my jazz friends may cringe, I doubt he was as good. But like Elvis C., he made the mistake of applying his refined taste to what he knew was the music of the future--hiring fine players, commissioning Ellington and Copland, emphasizing the danceability of an orchestra too grand to be called a band, he honored the classics. Who knows which of Costello's virtues will seem equally irrelevant 40 or 10 years hence--his obsessive wit? his precise arrangements? his respect for musical history? Unless I'm mistaken, though, he's doomed to be remembered as fatally self-conscious. And doomed as well never to convert the unconverted again.
"
FALSE,B,Get Happy!,Elvis Costello and the Attractions,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1155,"
This Stax-based twenty-song loss leader establishes not his fecundity but his fallibility--lotsa duds. I count maybe eight originals I'll remember half as well as the Sam &amp; Dave obscurity, and n.b.: the Sam &amp; Dave obscurity was the hit (U.K. hit, of course I mean). His rueful disavowal of ""Knock on Wood"" (in a dud) is no less impressive than his proud claim on ""Time Is Tight"" (in a keeper), and tropes and hooks abound--why deny lines like ""You lack lust you're so lackluster"" or ""I speak double dutch to a real double duchess""? On the other hand, why bother digging them out?
"
FALSE,B,American Fool,John Cougar,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5453,"
The breakthrough fluke of the year has it all over his predecessors in REO Speedwagon--Bob Seger, Cougar's current role model, has been dreaming of riffs with this much melodic crunch ever since Night Moves, and when I don't think about whys and wherefores they satisfy my mainstream cravings. But the guy is a phony on the face of it, and not in a fun way--anybody with the gall to tell teen America that once you pass sixteen ""the thrill of living is gone"" has been slogging toward stardom for so long he never noticed what happened to Shaun Cassidy.
"
FALSE,B,Funk Pump,The Counts,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6639,"
I feared the worst when I realized the lead cut was Carole King's ""Jazzman,"" the worst being that they'd gotten ""better."" More vocals, more horns, more pop moves, and when the female chorus sings ""This ain't a song it's just a magic ride"" you can be sure it ain't a magic ride either. The title cut is built like a fire hydrant, and I enjoy side two until ""Tecalli,"" where their Latin accent gets suave. But jazzmen they're not.
"
FALSE,B,Show Me,The Cover Girls,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4594,"
Set on pulling a marketable girl group out of a Latin hip hop concept, their svengalis channel the mix toward wall-of-sound, fuzzing beats and harmonies with a nostalgic soupcon of Spectorian grandeur. The damage is minor but, for me, decisive--I prefer Exposï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½'s hooks to these (superior) songs, can't get with Angel Sabater even though she makes Lisa Lisa s"
FALSE,B,Animal Notes,Crack the Sky,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6643,"
""We Want Mine,"" a jarring little rocker about Third World deprivation, and ""Animal Skins,"" which quotes George Harrison as it salvages every religious leader who's ever lived, convinced me for a while that the rest of this systematically disjoint music flowed and crackled appropriately. But for the most part the melodies of these art-pop set pieces don't live up to the harmonies; their premeditated shifts recall late Beatles when they work and middle Uriah Heep when they don't. I still prefer songs about Mounties to songs about centaurs. But I also prefer Mountie songs that keep galloping when the lyrical conceit gets boring, which it does.

FALSE,B,Psychedelic Jungle,The Cramps,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4596,"
After setting the mood with two obscure sureshots from the Pebbles anthology (why wasn't ""Green Fuz"" a hit?), En Why's own mock rockabillies come up with an actual novelty album instead of a theoretical one. If only there weren't these jokes about rape, voodoo, and jungle folk (at least they're not called ""bunnies,"" although they do ""hop""), I might still be chuckling.
"
FALSE,B,Who's Been Talkin',The Robert Cray Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4598,"
Hailed by the ever tightening knot of blues loyalists as the next . . . Son Seals?, Cray can recite his catechism without kowtowing to orthodoxy--guitar like Albert Collins only chillier and more staccato, voice like B.B. King only cleaner and, well, thinner. Willie Dixon and Howlin' Wolf songs lead for good reason, but both artist and producers write with uncommon acidity (try ""Nice as a Fool Can Be"" and ""The Score"" respectively) and country-soul cult hero O.V. Wright adds the right kind of historical perspective. A little more vocal muscle and he might compete with . . . Son Seals.

FALSE,B,Crazy Backwards Alphabet,Crazy Backwards Alphabet,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4599,"
Though Beefheart-FFKT drummer John French, Dixie Dregs bassist Andy West, and hockey-mad Swedish avant-rocker Michael Maksymenko get equal billing, this is Henry Kaiser's pickup project--you can tell because he's on every cut. Concept is Beefheart as Dixie Dregs, kind of, with intermittent lyrics, not always in English. You'll go for Maksymenko singing ZZ Top in Russian, and Kaiser-West-Maksymenko rocking Albert Ayler. Both covers, you notice. I never did get Dixie Dregs.
"
FALSE,B,Mardi Gras,Creedence Clearwater Revival,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6649,"
For a while I forgot my John Fogerty fixation and enjoyed side two of this country-rock debut, which is what asking Stu Cook and Doug Clifford to sing and compose transforms the seventh Creedence album into. But facts are facts. Only ""Sweet Hitch-Hiker,"" an original as unambitious as the equally effecting cover of ""Hello Mary Lou,"" could stand on any of Creedence's great albums. ""Lookin' for a Reason"" and ""Someday Never Comes"" may be major songs, but it's hard to tell from the way Fogerty sings them. And only inspired Fogerty vocals might save C&amp;C's competent-plus to competent-minus filler from a lifetime in Lodi.

No devotee of live albums by anybody, much less by guys who come out and recreate their studio renditions of songs and choogles conceived in Lodi, I do hereby certify that this one, said to be a newly discovered 1970 tape, is tighter and more explosive than the flaccid Live in Europe double of their breakup's afterglow. I also acknowledge that after three or four years with bands who want nothing so much as to finance studio renditions of songs and explosions conceived in lower Manhattan, I've learned to enjoy the form. Just make sure you get the studio renditions first.

Work too long toward a future that never arrives and you lose your hold on what comes naturally. Where once he soared, now he drags, and don't blame Don Dixon, whose hitbound modesty and popful soul match Marshall's fine. When your strongest song is about how nobody understands you, you're crying out for a spiritual lift no producer can provide.

FALSE,B,Bad Manors,Crowbar,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6662,"
For classicists, these guys are certainly undiscriminating--they prefer critical exuberance to critical intellect, which may be why some critics go overboard for them. Jimmie Rodgers yodel meets slide-cum-pedal-steel meets pop chorale meets folk segues, and though the originals don't match the oldies, the oldies are ""House of Blue Lights"" and ""Let the Four Winds Blow.""

FALSE,B,The Best of the Crusaders,The Crusaders,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6663,"
""A group for all seasons and all tastes,"" annotator Don Heckman proclaims, and given ""Chain Reaction"" and ""Soul Caravan"" and most of side one--especially the irresistible ""Put It Where You Want It""--I guess that includes me. I resent it, though. Better Wilton Felder honking his horn and Stix Hooper laying into that beat than Tom Scott and friend, but if this is El Lay's idea of the hard stuff may Booker T. preserve us. Their basic project is soulful Muzak, Muzak with charms to soothe the complacent humanist, and there are hundreds of harder hard bop and funkier funk albums. Try Lee Morgan's Cornbread or James Brown's Sex Machine.

FALSE,B,Good Things,Culture,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4612,"
After a 10-year layoff they have a right to simultaneous albums, but not simultaneous genre exercises. The overriding theme befits the layoff--they feel beset by all these kids who have strayed from the right path. ""Cousin Rude Boy"" and ""Youthman Move"" are fearful and imploring, so alienated that they're a tad less ordinary than you'd figure, while the title tune is positively avuncular--in one of the most unmillenarian sentiments ever uttered by a Rasta, it urges youth to enjoy electric lights and fax machines while they're still around. ""Psalm of Bob Marley"" has a great tune.
"
FALSE,B,Kissing to Be Clever,Culture Club,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4613,"
A lot of new English bands I wish were even worse than they are--every time Haircut 100 or Depeche Mode finds a riff or a groove it means they may last longer than the fifteen months allotted by the march of fashion. This new English band I wish were better, because for all their fashionability I think their hearts are in the right place--they look so weird because that's the way they feel. They do come up with catchy tunes, too. But their bland Caribbean rhythms move no muscles, and their confrontations with racial issues are rarely more than a phrase deep.

Since I had even less use for the dismissive because-he-wears-dresses theory than for the ridiculous new-Smokey analysis, I could never figure out this cutie-pie's means of commercial propulsion, but I know why he's having trouble staying up there: because he wears dresses. Given the discernible leftward shift in his soft focus, led by a catchy, censored single, this calls for concerted protest--which might be easier to whip up if the latest album weren't part three of more-of-the-same.
"
FALSE,B,Burton Cummings,Burton Cummings,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6664,"
""Stand Tall"" was a deserving hit that generated a great follow-up: ""I'm Scared,"" the uncommitted prayer for faith of a skeptic who knows the religious tensions of a materialistic epoch firsthand. But when a slickie like Cummings turns rock crooner, credibility is a continuing problem, and while everything else on this honestly crafted solo debut is passable or better, the only other cut I'd call convincing is a big-band mock-up of former small-bandmate Randy Bachman.

FALSE,B,The Head on the Door,The Cure,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4619,"
In the wiggy abstraction of his self-regard, Robert Smith has evolved into a Brit art-pop archetype. Eccentric though his songs are, they offer nothing arresting in the way of imagery (""like a baby screams"" and ""it's so smooth it even feels like skin,"" which latter is admittedly pretty good, are as meaty as it gets), much less character or incident. They're not really observed--it's more like they're experienced at a distance. Yet they're not dreamlike, though while he's at it he does report on his dreams--it's more like he doesn't know the difference between loneliness, solipsism, and satori, with lots of stuff about loved ones (girlfriends, I mean) who one way or another aren't there, or real, or something. His characteristic vocal technique is the unacknowledged sob. Yet his music, which on this album runs from New Order rip and electrodisco pseudo-strings to guitar sounds and many lands, isn't rendered any more normal by its exceedingly skillful deployment. And his originality is winning--he's clearly not just intelligent but hyperaware, at home in his alienation, and hence hero, even sex symbol, to a generation. Or at least its arty, collegiate market share.

FALSE,B,Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me,The Cure,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4620,"
Samey samey samey is the strategy--repeat repeat repeat repeat the same four-bar theme for sixteen, twenty-four, forty-eight, sixty-four bars before Robert Smith starts to whine, wail, warble, work. Because Smith hasn't veered this far pop since he was a boy, most of the themes stick with you, and in a few cases--my pick is ""Just Like Heaven,"" which gets off to a relatively quick start--his romantic vagaries have universal potential. But especially over a double album, the strategy gets pretty tedious unless Smith happens to be whining, wailing, warbling, or working to you.

In which a rangy baritone with a patch over one eye regales thousands of truckers with their own mythology. Sociologists will note that his rebel persona embraces lots of sex and several blues. Skeptical waitresses will guess that his ""Sixty Minute Man"" starts counting at coffee and ends at bye. Skeptical rock and rollers will wonder about his vocal resonance and his sense of rhythm. And Americana fans will dig it.
"
FALSE,B,Second Time Around,Cymande,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6669,"
When you hum this music you hum Steve Scipio's bass lines--not the vocals, and not the guitar parts of Scipio's cocomposer Patrick Patterson. Which says something for the abiding flexibility that always makes it comfortable to listen to. But also helps explain why it's rarely anything more.

FALSE,B,A Decade of Hits,The Charlie Daniels Band,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4625,"
""Uneasy Rider"" is still perfect--a tall tale of a new outlaw, peace-loving but not a damn fool about it, grabbing a redneck by the symbolic short hair. But a year later ""The South's Gonna Do It"" sang the praises of long-haired rednecks, and he never looked back. A safer tall tale, the predictable ""Devil Went Down to Georgia,"" put him back on the singles charts in 1979, and in 1980 the Russkie-baiting ""America"" proved what the self-reliant individualism of ""Long Haired Country Boy"" was good for. Already pushing fifty, he's just a Southerner of a certain generation. Sometimes he's a lot of fun. If he sang as good as Merle Haggard we might even forgive his jingoism.

A stronger album than I'd expect from the Band at this moment in history. Danko's solo debut includes a more sharply conceived city song than Robbie Robertson has ever come up with and a more sharply conceived coffee song than . . . well, the category is admittedly less extensive. Plus the classic ""Small Town Talk,"" one of the decade's great love songs. Plus five of the decade's ordinary ones.

And I thought Bitches Brew was unfocused. Well, it was--and it was also pretty great. This is more unfocused, and not great. Comprising four (apparently unedited) twenty-five-minute swatches entitled ""Wednesday Miles,"" ""Thursday Miles,"" etc., it noodles unforgivably--the electric keyboards of Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett on Wednesday provide one of the most aimless patches. Every side does offer at least one treasures--the cool atmospherics that lead off Wednesday, the hard bop in extremis toward the end of Thursday, the way Miles blows sharply lyrical over Jack DeJohnette's rock march and Airto Moreira's jungle sci-fi for the last few minutes of Friday, all the activity surrounding Steve Grossman's solo on Saturday. Just wish the damn records were banded.

FALSE,B,Tyrone Davis' Greatest Hits,Tyrone Davis,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6685,"
I'd be less inclined to quibble about this sixteen-song selection if the three-plus years it spans were long enough for one small factory to come up with sixteen go-rillas in a medium tempo, which is the only one Davis knows. But though there's classic stuff here, only Davis's gamely anachronistic soul style--blues crooning with touches of grit, like a less sharply defined Bobby Bland or a softer Little Milton--provides interest most of the time. And too often Willie Henderson's horns (not to mention his strings) make you yawn anyway.

On the B, former La Peste vocalist Dayton and aspiring producer Ric Ocasek combine for an OK title tune and a sub-OK instrumental. On the A, they concoct the Cars-sexy ""Skintite"" and the Velvets-catchy ""Stuck on the Same Refrain."" Which I'm stuck on.

Yeah it rocks, but when a pop group leaves it at that they're no better than their latest song, and when their sole remaining songwriter is still dissecting serial monogamy as he says bye to thirty, chances are his latest song doesn't even interest him all that much. With Chris Stamey they really had a sound. And with Chris Butler they really had a groove.

Proving that not all black rock-and-rollers have forgotten Chuck Berry, or maybe that not all black musicians have forgotten rock and roll, young Fats shouts out his claim.

Despite Stiv Bators's mewl, which can get almost as annoying as Geddy Lee's falsetto, this is mostly well-crafted junk, tough and tuneful and in one case--the definitively deafening ""Sonic Reducer""--positively anthemic.

Especially since Eldra, to honor the name his mama gave him, has shown something like genius as both writer and producer, the plethora of outside help is a double down. But though you can be sure this projected crossover is expected to produce a run of peppy crossover singles, starting with El's second straight meaningless movie theme, it has the flow of an album, even the personal stamp.

""Smoke on the Water"" is about a big fire in Montreux, obviously the most exciting thing to happen to these fellows since the London Symphony Orchestra. No jokes about who's getting burned, though--I approve of their speeding, and Ritchie Blackmore has copped some self-discipline as well as a few suspicious-sounding licks from his buddies in London. Personal to Paul Kantner: Check out ""Space Truckin'.""

Cut the shit, keep them away from large auditoria, and what you end up with is surprisingly kick-ass: lifting one or two songs from half a dozen albums that have only pushy organist Jon Lord and dum-dum drummer Ian Paice in common, this rocks. With the predictable exceptions--solo here, bridge there, Lord's conservatory application ""Child in Time"" throughout--it's barely even pretentious. ""Black Night"" and ""Woman From Tokyo"" and of course ""Highway Star"" are as worthy of Nuggets as anything the Stangeloves ever recorded.

FALSE,B,New Beginnings,The Dells,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6693,"
Hard to get too interested in virtuoso harmonies expended on mediocre material, and like most vocal-group LPs, this is slow going at times. But it ends up quite impressive. Instead of resigning themselves to the oldies circuit--four of the five Dells have been together for twenty-five years, so they sure qualify--they've sought out new songs from a variety of sources, including two George Clinton-produced Parliaments classics. Wish they didn't figure it was modern to put only four on a side, though.

FALSE,B,Jackie,Jackie DeShannon,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6700,"
About once a year, Jerry Wexler tries to bring a fundamentally soulful white female pop singer up to the minute. Sometimes it works (Dusty in Memphis, the all-time rock-era torch record), sometimes it doesn't (Cher, Lulu). This one almost works, not because DeShannon is such a terrific singer--although she's a lot more terrific with Wexler and friends pushing her from the bottom--but because for the first time in a while she's written a few terrific songs. Nothing wrong with her up-to-the-minute country-soul covers of Van Morrison, Neil Young, and their lessers, and nothing just right either. When she launches into her own ""Vanilla 'Olay"" or ""Anna Karina,"" though, she sounds like time is on her side.

The title tune is pure dance groove, quite distinctive: I'd compare it to a locomotive, only it's smoother, maybe a diesel. The other good stuff is less distinctive: after the ""you make me wanna moan"" bit I would have sworn my man Al had indulged in a little label-jumping, but the real culprit is probably coproducer W. Mitchell.

You probably wouldn't play this one again except for ""Whatcha Gonna Wear Tomorrow,"" but you do, and it grows on you, and you hum it sometimes, so you play it some more, and then you get tired of it and put it away and don't expect you'll ever play it again.

This singing (and writing) sewer designer scored three anachronistically soulish hits in 1974, then dropped from sight. Here he resurfaces with an anachronistically soulish (and anachronistically disco-ish) ""new version"" of his biggie, ""Be Thankful for What You've Got.""

Filler plus three major songs, each of which gets an explanatory video in concert, which with these art-school ciphers is a comfort. In ""Through Being Cool,"" a sexually and racially integrated platoon of ""young alien types"" do in fact ""eliminate the ninnies and the twits,"" though rather than the bone-crunching tactics the lyric prescribes they utilize a ray gun that reduces two discoids to a Clyfford Still blur, transforms three joggers into old people, and blows two old people away. In ""Love Without Anger"" two humans in chicken suits bill and coo after fighting over pecking order. And in ""Beautiful World"" the mild closing disclaimer ""But not for me"" is amplified by a panoply of newsreel horrors. None of which will satisfy the ninnies and twits who think war toys and visual aids are evil by definition.

Perhaps it will clear something up to specify that this is not a soul record. It is a weird record. Never have soul horns sounded remotely as sour, and Kevin Rowland can't carry a tune to the next note. There are horn interjections that make me laugh out loud at their perfectly timed wrong rightness, and with Kevin Rowland quavering through his deeply felt poesy and everybody else blaring away, I enjoy it in much the same way I enjoy a no-wave band on a good night--DNA, say. But DNA I understand.

Their offensiveness is typified quite nicely by their name and the name of their album--anyone smart enough to fool around with such terminology ought to be decent enough not to. Their excuse is that their galumphing beat, their ripped-off hooks, and their burlesqued melodrama are funnier than ever, and I admit that after dozens of playings I like this almost as much as I did their first. But I liked their first instantly, which is the way dumb jokes should work, and anyway, no one has answered my big question: do they play their own instruments?

J Mascis is a one-trick guitar god whose act gets sloppier and samier as his adolescence becomes more figurative. He does have his own instrumental sound, a roiling whine that's the essence of grunge on pot. Unfortunately, he also has his own vocal sound, ditto. Grunge's pothead contingent will adore him until he succumbs to male-pattern baldness. But someday, archaeologists will wonder just exactly what was the point. I wonder now.

FALSE,B,Dire Straits,Dire Straits,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6719,"
Despite initial misgivings, I've found this thoughtful and sexy. The decisive touch is how Mark Knopfler counterpoints his own vocals on guitar--only a musician with a real structural knack could sound like two people that way. But there's a streak of philistine ideology here that speaks for too many white r&amp;b players these days--most of them can't be bothered articulating it, that's all. In ""In the Gallery,"" an honest sculptor has his bareback rider, coal miner, and skating ballerina rejected by the ""trendy boys,"" ""phonies,"" and ""fakes"" who (literally) conspire together and ""decide who gets the breaks."" Those who find this rather simplistic should now ask themselves whether Knopfler's beloved Sultans of Swing--not to mention Dire Straits--have more in common with that sculptor than he suspects.

FALSE,B,My Feet Can't Fail Me Now,The Dirty Dozen Brass Band,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4669,"
I may never get over early reports describing this New Orleans neotrad octet as ""funky,"" which I took to mean that in addition to integrating Monk and Bird tunes into marching-band polyphony they had a bottom like James Brown or at least the Meters. After one listen, I realized what I already knew--that to get a funk beat out of tuba, bass, drum, and snares isn't difficult, it's impossible. Maybe the big deal is that they're not only fun in a mild, neotrad way, but also what Dr. John used to call ""fonky""--that even though they play jazz, people dance to it. A not inconsiderable conceptual triumph, but those who dance a lot anyway are unlikely to appreciate it. Upped a notch for integrating Monk and Bird tunes into marching-band polyphony.

The cameos--by Dr. John, Dizzy Gillespie, and Branford Marsalis--are the giveaways, because this jaunty concept needs those guys, to sing or solo as the case may be. The headliners are the lounge band of a tourist's dreams, and that's all they are. Why in the world cover Stevie Wonder's message-laden ""Don't Drive Drunk"" as an instrumental (polyphonic, mais oui)? Because it's a deathless piece of music? To prove how up-to-date you are? Or to stump the clientele in a game of name-that-tune?

Clear, tuneful, hard-driving, this is one of those records that jumps you so good you may never think to wonder why they bothered. I did, however--occupational hazard, you know.

With Mike Chapman the hooker, Christina Amphlett enters the race for Miss Bad Girl of 1986 and is fairly depressing for side one. After dumping a bucket of water on her head, she starts to play rough overdisc, but it's too late.

This is the genderfucked Sweet that Mike Chapman should have gotten out of Christina Amphlett last time, before Vic Maile and Girlschool beat them to it, but as with straight Sweet, the tunes pound by a little too evenly to change the world. ""Dirty Love"" will never besmirch CHR, and unless she gets lucky with ""Hey Little Boy,"" a genderfucked cover the world's been waiting for since 1966, it could be three-strikes-she's-out for a dirt-eater who deserves better.

Dixon is the first important blues composer since the classic era who isn't also an important singer. Between songwriting royalties and production income, he doesn't have to perform much--which may be why his records are so undistinguished. It's not that Dixon doesn't have a ""good voice""--is it ever? But he's never developed his expressive potential. The material is classic, and the backing by an anonymous ""hand-picked crew of Chicago blues veterans"" adds personality (is that Otis Spann?), but this document is for collectors only.

For three cuts it doesn't matter that he says nothing fast--not only is the music funky (his favorite word), it's clever, multileveled, gut-wrenching, ear-opening. Add the raucous Michel'le cameo ""Comm. Blues"" and you begin to think he deserves his best-seller, message or no message. And then, zip. Except on the tongue-twisting ""Portrait of a Master Piece,"" the funk straightens out so abruptly you soon wonder what he's got to say. The less the better, as it turns out--guess who's ""Beautiful but Deadly.""

FALSE,B,Malpractice,Dr. Feelgood,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1092,"
As with so much pub-rock, this never quite gets out of the pub. The funk quotient of bands like this one is invaluable, and their U.S. bid does offer several memorable originals (""Another Man"" and ""Don't Let Your Daddy Know"") and worthy remakes (""I Can Tell"" and ""Riot in Cell Block #9""). But then there's all the OK stuff--side two is a B side indeed, if not C plus. And I can't help wondering whether a debut album that sounds like a stylized J. Geils Band doesn't portend death by secondhand mechanization.

Like so many Brits (and Yanks), they think they've got a new wrinkle on ""American rock,"" and with bespectacled Peter Perrett soundalike Paul Smith writing and singing and playing, they manage one: chaotic feedback and organ murk subsumed in the soaring Byrdsy-Velvetsy ebb and flow. But I wouldn't say they ""return it [`American rock'] with a looping back-spin,"" though that's hardly a momentous claim. And so it goes in the realm of better-than-average guitar bands.

""Behind the myth lies the effort of the rhythm [rythm?],"" she muses in re racial relations. But the effort of the rhythm is in the preparation and production, not necessarily the final product.

Though this sums up their brush with greatness, a/k/a Michael McDonald, McDonald has grasped greatness but once: on the eternally recurrent apothegm ""What a Fool Believes,"" here isolated overdisc from such grazes, whisks, and sweeps as ""Here to Love You,"" ""Real Love,"" and ""Minute by Minute."" Vanity, vanity--usefulness rather than greatness is the purview of a record like this, and thus the first volume stands as a more fetching collection of ephemera. Better than Minute by Minute and One Step Closer on the sociological ground that it got more total airplay.

Strong performances and audio.

Not counting the live double (from which this inexplicably includes ""Who Do You Love"") and the two non-Morrison albums (from which this explicably includes nothing) the Doors recorded six LPs.

Conventional exercises on side one: liberal protests (""Wasted Country"") and reflective love songs (""If Only You""). But from the literal title tune to the Beethoven-drenched romantic climax, side two is the yuppie blues, its killer the literal ""No Time,"" about how busy she is. Pet Shop Boys, this is how it sounds with soul.

Sounds like better Motown than recently and greasier Motown than ever, and it figures--this Tempts-styled Detroit quintet, with Ron Banks in the David Ruffin role, play for the Memphis Grease Kings. ""Get Up and Get Down"" and ""Watcha See Is Whatcha Get"" resound with uptempo bottom, and while I find the big dramatic number, ""In the Rain,"" a little too big and too dramatic, I do prefer Don Davis's sound effects to Norman Whitfield's. Better filler than Motown, too--but not that much better.

Dury's idiomatic literacy is a continuing pleasure, but only on ""Quiet"" (to his kids) and maybe ""This Is What We Find"" (comedic-philosophical) is it enough, because the music tries too bleeding hard to be ingratiating. The man is supposed to be too English for us colonials, but I feel a lot more at home with the musichall rock of New Boots and Panties!! than with the fusoid pop internationalism of Chaz Jankel's arrangements here--jazz per Ramsey Lewis, reggae per Byron Lee, disco per Arthur Murray.

Hitch Mick Taylor to a locomotive, make sure the songs are twenty years old, and you could get shit. But you could also get a decent live album if the auteur happened to be interested that night. ""Maggie's Farm"" and ""Tombstone Blues"" are the keepers, ""License to Kill"" and the ludicrous white reggae ""I and I"" are the ringers, and ""Tangled Up in Blue"" gets some new lyrics--or maybe they're really old ones.

Automatic horns and Dylanettes echoing every chorus, covers and collaborations--sounds like something he threw together in a week and away forever. But throwing it away is how he gets that off-the-cuff feel, and side two is great fun. Tough rocker with Tom Petty, lissome popper with Carole Bayer Sager, and with Sam Shepard one of the greatest and most ridiculous of his great ridiculous epics. Doesn't matter who came up with such lines as ""She said even the swap meets around here are getting corrupt"" and ""I didn't know whether to duck or run, so I ran""--they're classic Dylan. And on side one we have automatic horns and Dylanettes echoing every chorus, covers and songs he wrote all by himself.

His seventh studio job of the decade is the third he didn't just churn out and thus the third to get hyped as a turnaround, but really, there is a difference. Daniel Lanois's understated care and easy beat suit his casual ways, and three or four songs might sound like something late at night on the radio, or after the great flood. All are modest and tuneful enough to make you forgive ""Disease of Conceit,"" which is neither. So I forgive him.

The lead signer on one of the best Motown albums in years is a mascara-eyed, effeminate--gay--falsetto named Tony Washington. His devotion to group tradition has inspired Ashford &amp; Simpson to write a more melodic bunch of songs than they've managed for any of their own albums yet.

Joining her playmates' games of can-you-top-this with a ringleader's enthusiasm, she gives full rein to her imagination, such as it is.

These guys certainly boogie more than the bluegrass sellouts who populate the vaguely country-oriented mainstream of contemporary American rock, and they certainly write more memorable songs. But this culminates the reactionary individualism that country-rock has come to epitomize in the counterculture. What's worse, the country orientation bespeaks not roots but a lack of them, so that in the end the product is suave and synthetic--brilliant, but false. And not always all that brilliant, either.

Hum 'em high--ten poptunes from the Four Lads of I'm-okay I'm-okay are probably a must for those who've concluded they're geniuses by listening to the radio. I happen to remember that what makes On the Border a decent album isn't their ""victory song"" (over guess what kind of person) but the songs to, about, and by other men, and that the only other decent cut on last year's breakthrough was the one that told a hard truth about the artists.

Speaking strictly as a nonfan, I'd grant that this is their most substantial if not their most enjoyable LP--they couldn't have written any of the songs on side one, or even the pretentious and condescending ""The Last Resort,"" without caring about their California theme down deep. But though one strength of these lyrics is that they don't exclude the Eagles from purgatory-on-earth, Don Henley is incapable of conveying a mental state as complex as self-criticism--he'll probably sound smug croaking out his famous last words (""Where's the Coke?""). I'd also be curious to know what Mexican-Americans think of the title tune's Spanish accent.

Though they're nowhere near as lame as the artist claims (what do artists know? and why should they tell us about it?), these occasionally surprising studies in neotraditionalist rockabilly do lack that crucial aura of authority--the walking bass sounds more committed than the callow abandon when it should be the other way round. Still, side one won't disillusion, and two strokes shouldn't get lost on the B: the supernal male narcissism of ""My Baby Worships Me,"" and ""Devil's Right Hand,"" a ban-handguns parable you'd swear is as old as the Louvin Brothers.

This time, it isn't only the heavy beat, loud guitars, and wild-ass vocal mannerisms that make it rock--giveaway's the melodrama that rock set pieces substitute for the flat inevitability of the country variety. So my prescription is simple: more Tom T., less Bruce. Meanwhile, just say his vision of history is more convincing than his vision of personal relations. Which these days is another giveaway.

FALSE,B,Exit 0,Steve Earle & the Dukes,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4711,"
Last time you knew he was a rock-and-roller because he was a soulful wiseass, full of piss, vinegar, and super unleaded. This time you know he's a rock-and-roller because he puts his band's name on the slug line. Whether Nashville has a contract out on him or he harbors a secret desire to become a folksinger, his will to boogie gets mired down in the lugubrious fatalism that so often passes for seriousness among self-conscious Americans. Maybe the problem with country boys who are smart enough to write their own lyrics is that they're also smart enough to read their own reviews.

FALSE,B,Gratitude,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6770,"
The three live sides reflect their genuine jazz orientation, flowing along enjoyably and unexcessively and offering more new material than is superstar practice. But orientation ain't chops, and despite my prejudices I'd rather hear Dvorak's New World Symphony than the Whites'. The four songs on the studio side are enjoyable, too--took them a while to figure out their formula, but now they've really got it down. The news that ""the good Lord gonna make a way,"" however, is gonna come as a surprise to Him, Her, or It.

EW&amp;F are the real black MOR, equivalent in their catchy way to the oh-so-expert Carpenters, though of course they're much better because they're black--that is, because the post-Sly and harmony-group usages they've had to master are so rich and resilient. Most of these songs are fun to listen to. But they're still MOR--the only risk they take is running headlong into somebody coming down the middle of the road in the opposite direction. Like the Carpenters.

Like so many leftist ideologues before them, they make promises they can't keep. ""Out on Your Own"" opens side one by calling the Red Wedge's bluff, ""Get Back to Russia"" opens side two with praise of Leningrad in spring, and then it's mostly uniform arena-jangle.

If anything might convince me that the term ""psychedelic revival"" means something it's ""Villiers Terrace,"" a real good terror-of-drugs song.

Like any hardcore band with the money, they include a lyric sheet. Unlike most, they don't need one--their work is admirably recognizable, words and music both. Which doesn't make it admirable. You can be sure these guys don't shoot ""screwdriver boys""--that's Bernie Goetz. And they don't ""beat up gays""--that's their dog. They're not steamed because they're ""feeding legions of wogs""--that's some middle-aged protofascist. They wouldn't rape anybody--that's the ""sick fucker"" who's on the street because ""the courts don't care."" But they do ""want to fuck a girl like you."" Funny fellows.

This Philadelphia group has been ignored just about everywhere but in Rolling Stone, where they were panned stupidly, perhaps out of geographical jealousy. All the players have the kind of blues-soul feeling that makes Nick Gravenites such a Bay Area hero, and in the best ballroom tradition the music occupies that uncharted region triangulated by rock, pop, and jazz--only it's tighter and more melodic than what you hear in the ballrooms.

He digs a thirteen-year-old version of ""Baby Let's Play House"" out of the basement, ignores Guy Mitchell's whistled hook on ""Singing the Blues,"" and acts as if George Jones left something out of ""The Race Is On."" Topper: Lowe-Carter-Edmunds's ""Living Again If It Kills Me,"" which happens to be a slow one.

FALSE,B,Life Love and Living,John Edwards,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6775,"
Soul lives, and so does David Porter--you remember, Isaac Hayes and David Porter, Sam &amp; Dave's producers? Porter's new kid crosses Al Green and Sam Cooke as if honoring a deathbed request by his mama, Porter Inc. provides a very consistent bunch of songs, and Muscle Shoals and Malaco style the music. But only God can make a hit.
"
FALSE,B,Live at Reggae Sunsplash,Eek-a-Mouse/Michigan & Smiley,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4725,"
Michigan &amp; Smiley are the Statler Brothers of toasting, but this 1982 performance is where the mighty Mouse transcended the novelty pigeonhole. His delight in the comic highs and lows of his range and the syllabic adaptability of his tongue and palate are even more vivid live than in the studio, and two of the songs here, including the quietly devastating ""Neutron Bomb,"" aren't on any of his five other U.S.-release albums.
"
FALSE,B,Electro-Shock Blues,The Eels,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3591,"
Mark Everett is a talented 31-year-old who bravely determined to deal with the dying he's seen in song. But that didn't mean he had to make a concept album. Beyond art-rock fashion, which has rendered the static song cycle stupid fresh again, the strategy suits a detachment he'd be drawn to in any era, a detachment that's devoid of charm--which also goes for the concept it hides behind, baggage doubly distracting for consumers without a press kit. I count three excellent songs--a plighted troth, a teen memory, and an unexpected flight in which Everett invites one of his deceased back for a last look. I sincerely hope they're all covered by singers who can show them the love they deserve.
"
FALSE,B,The Embarrassment EP,The Embarrassment,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4734,"
From exotic Wichita, with a gift for hookily hypnotic guitar lines that need a haircut. The big name at ""Celebrity Art Party"" is Art Carney, so they also have a gift for the off-rhyme. The rest is harder to remember.
"
FALSE,B,Flowers,The Emotions,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6788,"
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's girl group--literally. Whether it's Jeanette, Sheila, or Wanda who sounds like Diana Ross at a higher level of consciousness, the effect is exquisite. And their romantic platitudes are no worse than EW&amp;F's universalist ones. Which is pretty bad.
"
FALSE,B,Music for Airports,Brian Eno,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=447,"
Although I'm no frequenter of airports, I've found that these four swatches of modestly ""ambient"" minimalism have real charms as general-purpose calmatives. But I must also report that they've fared unevenly against specific backgrounds: sex (neutral to arid), baseball (pleasant, otiose), dinner at my parents' (conversation piece), abstract writing (useful but less analgesic than Discreet Music or my David Behrman record). Also, I'm still waiting for ""1/1"" to resolve the ""Three Blind Mice"" theme.
"
FALSE,B,Apollo: Atmospherics & Soundtracks,Brian Eno,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=450,"
Designed to help a moonshot documentary ""present a set of moods,"" this is ambient Eno at its most accessible--often very pretty, and not without guitar. Still, I expect mood music to sustain a mood, and while as you might expect none of this is unlistenable, some of it is very nearly inaudible, which can be almost as annoying. Left to itself, ""Drift"" does just that, and ""Stars"" and ""Under Stars"" sound like sleep sequences.
"
FALSE,B,Smash Your Head Against the Wall,John Entwistle,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6790,"
Entwistle is an important source of the fucked-up Calvinism that has always added that peculiar note of constraint to the Who--just remember where Peter Townshend turned when he needed a song about Uncle Ernie. These paeans of resentment and frustration climax thematically in songs called ""Heaven and Hell"" and ""You're Mine"" (starring John as Satan). But the music--not the melodies, the singing and playing--adds some not-so-peculiar constraints of its own.
"
FALSE,B,Whistle Rymes,John Entwistle,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6791,"
Subjects of songs: isolation, cuckold's desertion, cuckold's rancor, cuckold's failed suicide, neurotic passivity, idiot passivity, whoring in bad faith, peeping in good faith, getting played for a fool, and nightmares. Mood of music: tuneful but stolid hard rock. Disposition of career: ""interesting.""
"
FALSE,B,Hot,The Equators,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4737,"
An all-black ska band from Britain--they posed for the cover photo in a greenhouse. Unencumbered by message, concept, or apparent neurosis, the groove has more vim, muscle, get-up-and-go than the 2-Tone competition. Less interest, though. That's the thing about neurosis--it can really be interesting.
"
FALSE,B,Born to Burn,Ethel and the Shameless Hussies,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4743,"
The music is standard-issue neohonkytonk, but at least this red hot mama who smokes in bed writes her own lines. Good for a change and sometimes a hoot, and more progressive than Janie Fricke for damn sure.
"
FALSE,B,2 Places at the Same Time,E.U.,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4744,"
Like disco DJs, go go bands get high on contingency--all the interactive variables that pertain when you try to turn a crowd of dancers into a pulsating mass. So in theory I approve of these live, side-long jams of grooveful quotes and fragments. Except for the ultimately untheoretical fact that once they're recorded, they're not so damn contingent any more.
"
FALSE,B,Sweet Dreams Are Made of This,Eurythmics,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1211,"
In theory, synth duos have always been okey-doke with me, especially when the resulting pop is as starkly hooky as what Dave Stewart comes up with here. And you might say Annie Lennox has a bono vox. But like so many with comparable gifts, both these people are fools, and pretentious fools at that. Remember, folks--when they tell you everybody's out to use or get used, make certain you go along for the ride you paid for.
"
FALSE,B,Touch,Eurythmics,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4745,"
Physical gifts and technical accomplishments tempt a singer to overdramatize--Annie Lennox makes altogether too big a deal of punching the sofa. But even if she isn't, well, ""cooler than ice cream"" (really), I'm glad she's normal enough to want to be. If it's high-grade schlock you seek, this'll do as well as early Quarterflash. And Lennox has better hair.
"
FALSE,B,What's New,Bill Evans with Jeremy Steig,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10858,"
Usually, Evans is the final proof of the triviality of technical accomplishment, but occasionally he gets together with someone who complements him properly. No heavy riffs and not much heavy beat, but nice, especially for all of you who believe you like Jethro Tull.
"
FALSE,B,Long Player,Faces,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6796,"
The difference between these guys and their smaller forebears, the ones who released round-covered albums and sang ""Itchycoo Park"" with whine and phase, isn't just Steve Marriott vs. Rod Stewart. It's 1968 vs. 1971. Marriott was a pop craftsman with the Small Faces; with Humble Pie he's a boogie man. Stewart is a pop craftsman solo; with the Faces he's a boogie man. Boogie's not a bad idea, especially when you play it fast and loose rather than 'eavy like the 'Umbles. But as exciting as it is theoretically--and by comparison with the competition, boogieing and otherwise--it doesn't have much staying power. That's partly because they play it too loose and not quite fast enough. And partly because Stewart reserves his popcraft for solo LPs.
"
FALSE,B,Ooh La La,Faces,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6797,"
They do what they want to do very likably--this is as rowdy and friendly as rock and roll gets. But only on the title song and finale--written by the Rons (Wood and Lane) rather than the Rod--do they slap your back so's you'd still feel it five minutes later.
"
FALSE,B,Totale's Turns,The Fall,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4758,"
""The difference between you and us is that we have brains,"" Mark Smith announces to what the written notes call an ""80% disco weekend mating audience"" at the top of forty-three minutes of rant. The difference I notice is that the band is getting paid, but never mind--I'm so hungry for punk these days that I'm a sucker for the overall sound, maybe even the attitude. Yet though the minutes are divided officially into ten song titles, I confess I have trouble telling one from another except to point out that ""Roche Rumble"" is pretty fierce momentumwise. I also enjoy ""Choc-Stock"" (sounds like ""pop star"") and ""That Man"" (sounds like ""Batman""). And almost any time Smith revs his delivery up toward squeal.
"
FALSE,B,Grotesque (After the Gramme),The Fall,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4759,"
As postpunk splinters into a thousand shafts of shadow, these arty lefties are definitely going for poetry readings with two-chord backing. My favorite is the first punk song ever to mention Herb Alpert, who appears not as a musical icon but as a record executive--at the company that distributed them back when they were trying to sell out.
"
FALSE,B,Slates,The Fall,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4760,"
There's no denying it--taken as a whole, the six songs do exude punk-style intelligence. Titles like ""Middle Mass,"" ""An Older Lover Etc.,"" and ""Prole Art Threat"" don't disappoint--Mark Smith is interested in the kind of stuff you want intelligent-style punks to be interested in, and gives evidence of understanding it, too. But only ""Fit and Working Again,"" marked by an exploding two-note guitar riff, makes itself felt as an individual entity. And in the end it's hard to know exactly what Smith does think about all that stuff he's interested in--except that it's interesting. Inspirational Instruction: ""Don't start improvising, for God's sake.""
"
FALSE,B,"A Part of America Therein, 1981",The Fall,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4761,"
They're as consistent as the Isley Brothers: no notable rise in quality or interest, and also no falloff. This one's a U.S.-recorded live double divided into north and south discs (San Francisco counts as south, they claim). I prefer the north, especially ""The N.W.R.A.""--stands for North (of England?) Will Rise Again--and ""Totally Wired,"" which has the boys singing backup and something that will pass for a hook.
"
FALSE,B,Fearless,The Family,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6802,"
This hooks in on ""Sat'd'y Barfly,"" which sets Roger Chapman to bellowing drunken boasts over dissonant piano chords. The rest is equally abrasive and eccentric, but not always so good-humored, which when it doesn't hook in can be a problem.
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Donna Fargo,Donna Fargo,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6810,"
Despite her fondness for rose gardens, Fargo in her prime was a lot more credible than Lynn Anderson. Her good cheer always carried real conviction, perhaps because she wrote her happiness prescriptions/descriptions herself, although that little growl she learned from Loretta didn't hurt. Only a dour young city man like me (or woman like me wife) would complain about the way hubby and Jesus combine to stop her nagging in ""How Close You Came (to Being Gone)."" But we also note that the happiest girl in the whole USA has a job and lets her husband make the coffee. And that a year later she allows as how she's just not up to cohabiting with Superman.
"
FALSE,B,Faster Pussycat,Faster Pussycat,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4768,"
Supposedly, these glammers are the plastic (isn't that the term?) Aerosmith rip, as opposed to the authentically (right?) nasty boys in Guns N' Roses. They sure do mow down their allotted share of dynamite riffs on side one, though--fit right onto Toys in the Attic. And if side two is pretty generic, it's only a rip, its meaner impulses undercut by Russ Meyer camp.
"
FALSE,B,Crushin',Fat Boys,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4771,"
Rap's longest-running cartoon has all the street credibility of a DONT WALK sign, but that doesn't mean the anticrack and procondom messages won't make an impression with the home viewing audience. Doesn't mean the boys don't crush, either. Once a homemade music starts fulfilling its fantasies in the studio, it can also be manufactured there.
"
FALSE,B,Cooper-S,Feedtime,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4774,"
Most cover albums trip over their own roots--self-conscious simplicity is too neat a trick to bring off a dozen times running. These guys are adepts of self-conscious simplicity, so naturally they have trouble negotiating the radio classics that got them started. I mean, ""Paint It Black"" and ""Street Fighting Man"" have tempo shifts, man.
"
FALSE,B,No One Knows,The Feelies,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4775,"
Adds the slightly arcane Beatles song ""She Said She Said"" to the slightly arcane Neil Young song ""Sedan Delivery"" before it resorts to two Good Earth cuts that seem doubly otiose after Jonathan Demme has proven them capable of an all-cover EP. Or LP.
"
FALSE,B,Shuffering and Shmiling,Fela,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4779,"
Circa 1977, shortly after the Army torched his compound, an incorrigible troublemaker raps about the limits of God, sometimes in outrageous mock Arabic. Only one drawback: label's marketing the 12:21-minute song plus 9:47-minute version as an $8.98-list LP. As a single, this makes my top twenty-five. As an album it's docked two notches for forced format.
"
FALSE,B,Feliz Navidad: Merry Christmas From Freddy Fender,Freddy Fender,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6816,"
A tough ex-con blissfully unembarrassed by sentimentality, and with a terrific sense of rhythm, Freddy could have made a (bilingual!) Christmas album to rank with Phil Spector's. If only Huey Meaux (producer-svengali) hadn't hogged the copyrights, thus keeping Freddy away from ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" (his kind of song!) and--even worse--""Feliz Navidad"" itself. But I kind of love it anyway, and if it doesn't match UA's rereleased 12 Hits of Christmas or Rhythm and Blues Christmas, it beats hell out of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's White (get it?) (do I have to complete this title?)
"
FALSE,B,Let's Stick Together,Bryan Ferry,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=454,"
A lot of people are crazy about this record, but I find its bifurcation alienating. On the one hand, we have the usual unlikely borrowings, the most effective from Wilbert Harrison and the Everlys. And as usual, these are powerful, strange, and interesting--and often quite compelling. On the other hand, we have unlikely remakes of old Roxy Music material, much of it from the group's very first album. Although Ferry proves that he knows more about making records (and music) than he used to, the songs remain powerful, strange, and interesting--but not quite compelling. Add it all together and you get . . . two separate parts.
"
FALSE,B,Curtis,50 Cent,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13758,"
The first giveaway is a lie no less bold-faced with his Connecticut mansion on the trading block: ""I ain't fresh out the hood, I still in the hood."" The second is a truth all too revealing of the lost urgency of his aesthetic motivation: ""I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made."" What the two boil down to is that a parvenu mastering pop music for money has turned into a made man running on vanity. I find that this renders his expert trivialization of murder and such rather less piquant, and I think he does too--that an audacious formal delight has become routine. And though his sex talk retains some charm, Eminem's gross-out cameo casts a pall. Is Slim trying to one-up R. Kelly or just his D12 doxy Bizarre?
"
FALSE,B,Scan,Fine Art,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4786,"
Lead off with a deliberate, hypnotically bass-hooked existentialist ditty called ""You Tell Me"" that's the catchiest piece of white-woman art-funk since ""Too Many Creeps,"" they roll calmly downhill until the anticlimactic ""Scheduled Interruption,"" when they fall off a cliff that students of band names will have anticipated.
"
FALSE,B,If'n,Firehose,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4788,"
They sound more like a regular rock band and also more like the Minutemen, which isn't a contradiction because the Minutemen were evolving into a regular rock band when D. Boon died--one that resembled this fluidly funky outfit a lot more than the weird and wimpy hippies of the debut. This time Ed Crawford provides enough garage hooks to get by, meaning Mike Watt doesn't disappear amid the new guy's mannerisms. I only wish Mike Watt's Central American mention held like his Richard Hell mention and his Michael Stipe tribute.
"
FALSE,B,Armed and Extremely Dangerous,The First Choice,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6821,"
The only musicians not named on the back cover are the three women depicted on the front, the ones with the voices, including a satiny lead (Rochelle Fleming, according to informed sources) who shouldn't do songs about lovable polio victims and suicidal feelings--at least not these songs. I don't expect feminist anthems against the girl-group undertow, and these people have a lot more spunk than the Three Degrees or Love Unlimited. But I do insist on high-quality schlock, and beyond the pleasant-plus hits and a memorable cover of ""Love and Happiness"" this isn't it. I know, the Shirelles and the Chiffons never made great albums either. So buy the singles.
"
FALSE,B,An Evening With Wild Man Fischer,Wild Man Fischer,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10859,"
This record has gotten good reviews everywhere and I just wanted to concur: a fascinating document. But remember--it's a document, not music, recommended only to those with a serious interest in the rock subculture. Great term paper subject. Along the way, Frank Zappa provides two object lessons in the relationship of production to original material.
"
FALSE,B,Truth and Soul,Fishbone,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4793,"
They're better at truth than soul, always a harder sell, and harder to push beyond interesting, too. Taken one at a time, about half these experiments would change any radio station's pace quite satisfactorily. Taken in sequence, they don't follow.
"
FALSE,B,Youthman Penitentiary,Edi Fitzroy,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4794,"
""With the Roots Radics Band,"" announces a subtitle, and that's the usual good sign. ""Featuring his three 1982 top 10 Jamaican hits!"" crows a sticker, and I wish I were sure that the third one (after the title track and ""First Class Citizen,"" which gives itself away with a dub) were ""Dread Locks Party"" and its borrowed sax, not ""African Queen"" and its stolen Sedaka. ""The only new vocal star to emerge this year,"" inform the notes, and I hope 1983's has more than one trick in his or her gullet.
"
FALSE,B,The Soft Bulletin,The Flaming Lips,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3611,"
Tiptoeing along the precipice that divides the charmingly serious from the hopelessly ridiculous, this year's Prestigious Pink Floyd Tribute by a Long-Running Band of Some Repute and Less Distinction enjoys two advantages over OK Computer and Deserter's Songs. Not only does it map out a sonic identity, the chief selling point of all these records, but it's not above pretty. And lead genius Wayne Coyne mixes up the quotidian and the cosmic in the best American psychedelic tradition, with a social dimension more grounded than the usual dystopian mishmash-heroic scientists, gosh. All that granted, however, listeners with no generational stake in how old alt bands impact history are obliged not only to contend with Coyne's wispy voice and chronic confusion, but to stifle their giggles when Steven Drozd bangs his drums all over a song mixing up summer love and mosquito bites. That is, these guys are Not Joking. Ever. Which makes them hopelessly ridiculous.
"
FALSE,B,Teenage Head,Flamin Groovies,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3613,"
Surprisingly bluesy, with a good Robert Johnson cover, a great John Lee Hooker rip, and lots of slide guitar. Plus the title track, an inspired articulation/sendup of ""California born and bred"" youth rebellion. But ""High Flyin Baby,"" ""Evil Hearted Ada,"" and ""Whiskey Woman"" fall into the blues-rock trap--not surprising at all.
"
FALSE,B,Shake Some Action,Flamin Groovies,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3614,"
So authentic that producer Dave Edmunds has reverted to the muddy mix--kinda like the Beatles or the Byrds or the Flamin Groovies. Actually, what it sounds like is mono electrically rechanneled for stereo. The Flamin Groovies were Haight-Ashbury enough to exploit aural distance in the service of a sly, spaced-out obliqueness, but these guys, deprived of singer-composer Roy A. Loney and making their way as an English pop-revival band, get their kicks by playing dumb. This compiles their best recent work and includes some good songs. But only cultists will ever hear them.
"
FALSE,B,Oh!,Flamin' Oh's,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11411,"
This engaging, unpretentious, skillful, and ultimately forgettable collection of pop-tunes is the kind of indie album that makes me hope everybody involved is in it for love. Musically and lyrically, its straightforwardness is charming and tangy--there's none of the calculated swarm that marred so much L.A. pop, and none of the creative strain you can hear in New York bands like the dB's and the Individuals. But by the same token it's hard to tell why these Twin Cities boys care so much about the style, and thus it's unlikely they'll make anybody who isn't within hailing distance care about them. Point of information: a follow-up is imminent.
"
FALSE,B,There's No Face Like Chrome,Flash Cadillac and the Continental Kids,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1260,"
Unlike Sha Na Na, who are forced to rediscover how great oldies are every time they write an original, this isn't strictly a copy band, and on their follow-up album they prove it. Despite their unnecessarily stupid appearance, duh guys do not revert to the '50s solely for hard grit and axle grease, either, focusing instead on the sweet and funny part of pre-Beatles rock and roll. Tunes like ""Dancin' (on a Saturday Night)"" and ""Standin' on the Corner"" are impressive exercises. But only ""First Girl"" has a shot at entering the after-the-manner-of-Leiber-&amp;-Stoller canon, and they didn't write it. Also, Jerry Leiber produced it, which must have helped quite a bit.
"
FALSE,B,Future Games,Fleetwood Mac,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1262,"
These white blues (and hippie rockabilly) veterans shouldn't have to depend on new recruit Bob Welch's deftly metallized r&amp;b extrapolation for rock and roll, but unless you count the studio jam, they do. And if the best song on the album isn't the slowest, that's only because Welch also has mystagogic tendencies. It's the simplest in any case: Christine Perfect's ""Show Me a Smile.""
"
FALSE,B,Penguin,Fleetwood Mac,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6828,"
Those who complain about the remake of ""(I'm a) Road Runner,"" with Mick Fleetwood smashing past the cymbals while Dave Walker shouts, probably think these studio craftspeople were slumming when they jammed with Otis Spann. I love it. I also like all of Christine McVie's husky laments. But could rilly do without Bob Welch's ever-mellower musings.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Fleetwood Mac,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1267,"
To my surprise, I had more fun replaying side two of Mirage, which turns out to have some weird and pleasant shit on it. Reminding me that what distinguished them from your average great pop band was that their hits were improved by their putative filler. So with some obvious--in fact, all too familiar--exceptions, the radio-ready format makes them seem blander than they actually are.
"
FALSE,B,Blast Off!,Fleshtones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4805,"
As a student of history I'm glad these mythic 1978 sessions are finally for sale; as a connoisseur of inspired amateurism I must remind fun-seekers that magic is hard to mass-produce. The cruddy sound doesn't make it any more like being there, and after the wacko ""Soul Struttin'"" and the anthemic ""American Beat"" I start daydreaming about the next garage.
"
FALSE,B,Gone Fishin',Flipper,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1269,"
I must have listened to Generic Flipper fifty times without fully registering the dark and more or less unceasing roil of Ted Falconi's guitar. On this album it was the first thing I noticed. Watch out for bands who get heavily into texture. And stop making jokes.

Chris Hillman rocking through previously unrecorded covers from ""Orange Blossom Special"" to ""Don't Fight It,"" Gram Parsons's original country-soul concept for this band lives again. Unfortunately, it lives best on the previously recorded Parsons originals. And it lived better when he was singing them.
"
FALSE,B,John Fogerty,John Fogerty,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1765,"
The best singing here is at medium tempos--Fogerty sounds distraught for no reason when he rocks out, and the revved-up horns just push him harder. But the best songwriting is on the fast side-openers--""Rockin' All Over the World"" and ""Almost Saturday Night,"" neither of which could be called an illumination. This is what happens when rock devolves from a calling into an idea--you can't even be absolutely certain it's him rather than you, but you know he'll never get away with it twice.
"
FALSE,B,Eye of the Zombie,John Fogerty,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4809,"
With his compact songs and workingman's aura, Fogerty was an outsider in the '60s. In the '80s, with his San Fran contemporaries either cozying up to MTV or peddling nostalgia on the bar circuit, it's clear that he took the visionary fallacies of the time as deeply to heart as Jerry Garcia himself, and good for him. Then as now he had no interest in fashion, which is why his music retains an undeniable modicum of interest. But like they say, the '60s are over.

What jerks melody inflicts on us. With no connection to any human virtue of substance, the catchy tune ushers all manner of unpleasant personality traits into our lives. And if this smart aleck is less dangerous than Fred Durst, he also does less with what he was given. For sure he's less original musically (as opposed to melodically) no matter how many piano lessons he took, banging away like a garage guitarist with the occasional fancy stuff to prove he has a right--God, Joe Jackson was more fun. And although he also throws in the occasional well-turned sentiment to prove he has a right--""Don't Change Your Plans"" and ""Mess"" are recommended to nice guys seeking covers--his basic program remains revenge-of-the-nerd. He al ways knew he was smarter than whoever and ever amen. He always knew there were people who'd admire him just because he was clever. And unfortunately, he was right.

The real ageist scandal of this year's Grammys wasn't Herbie Hancock, who--unlike Natalie Cole and Tony Bennett in the long-lost '90s--won with the most artistically ambitious album nominee. It was this candid attempt to recapitulate Nirvana Mark II's 10-year-old triumph, The Colour and the Shape, a bonus-cutted reissue of which was released just two months before the Foos' ballyhooed reunion with producer Gil Norton, all of which can be read as the defiant professional credo of The Man Who Invented Nickelback. Kurt was a quitter, but Dave Grohl says he'll ""never surrender,"" just like the download-combatting stalwarts who chose him over Daughtry and Bruce Springsteen. Sure, Grohl is hookier than Nickelback, which is saying something. But he's not as hooky as those bonus cuts, which include Prince and Killing Joke songs, or as intense as his 1997 self. And the well-rounded optimist will go along with the hooky up-and-at-'em of ""Cheer Up, Boys"" only till he or she notices the subtitle, which is: ""(Your Make Up Is Running."") Those emo posers, how dare they?

FALSE,B,Love Letters,Force M.D.'s,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4812,"
If only there was a little something to the songwriting, the cute idea of anchoring a falsetto group to a rap rhythm section might have produced more than an exceedingly cute album. Certainly the fivesome sing sweet and rap sharp, and the LeBlanc-Wimbish-McDonald bottom is almost lithe enough for a top, even on the reggae. But not quite.
"
FALSE,B,David Forman,David Forman,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6844,"
Comparisons are odiferous, and this one--David Forman/Randy Newman--is commonplace as well. Sorry. At least I don't mean the words; except for the unconvincing ""Rosalie"" and one or two others, these employ evocative metaphor, in the manner of Jackson Browne, rather than evocative social detail. It's the r&amp;b-based singing and precise, manneristic arrangements, both (unintentionally?) redolent of Newman, that bother me. Even Jackson Browne knows that groupings of associative metaphors hold together best along a groove, and since Forman, unlike Newman, has the pipes to bring off the sweeter soul modulations, you'd figure he'd go that way. Instead, he sets each song--like a jewel, or a loose tooth in a denture. Many-faceted though they may be, these songs are neither gemlike nor biting, and the settings, unlike Newman's, too often sound readymade.
"
FALSE,B,Aretha Live at Fillmore West,Aretha Franklin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6855,"
This record almost gets over on sheer vocal excess. Neither Aretha in Paris nor any of her studio albums has ever caught her in such an explosive mood, and the result is a ""Dr. Feelgood"" that could heal the halt and versions of ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" that sound like Sunday morning. But though the speedy tempos help vitalize those last two songs as well, they do less than nothing for ""Respect"" and ""Don't Play That Song"" and can't save ""Love the One You're With"" or ""Make It With You"" (did she have to do 'em both?). And while in theory nothing could be more exciting than an eight-minute duet with Ray Charles on ""Spirit in the Dark,"" in practice I'd rather hear Ray sing ""The Three Bells"" and Aretha go it alone.
"
FALSE,B,Sparkle,Aretha Franklin,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6860,"
Aretha vamping over competent-plus Curtis Mayfield tracks is sexy at worst, mixing rhythmic and emotional frisson, soul product as it should be, albeit deplorably post-verbal. Good late-night listening, I suppose--but not as good as Spirit in the Dark, or Super Fly.
"
FALSE,B,La Diva,Aretha Franklin,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6863,"
Blame what's wrong with this record on the late trite Van McCoy, one of the most tasteless arrangers ever to produce an LP. What saves it is that McCoy didn't control half of these songs--arrangements by Richard Gibbs and Arthur Jenkins (rhythm only) and Zulema Cusseaux and Skip Scarborough (rhythm plus orchestration) provide frequent relief. Aretha contributes two sisterly originals, which are really fine, and one loverly original, which isn't. Because McCoy keeps intruding she never gets a flow going. But there haven't been this many good cuts on an Aretha album in five years.

I don't trust Franks's sambas to drowse by, but when he mentioned that he heard from his ex on the back of his checks he woke me up long enough to make me believe he had some smarts. Quite a lot of smarts, actually. Then I dozed off again.
"
FALSE,B,Fire and Water,Free,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6867,"
From sodden blooze to steady, unpretentious rock and roll in three progressively simpler--as opposed to easier--albums, climaxing with ""All Right Now,"" a bone-crunching single you can groan along with. Recommended follow-up: a shortened ""Mr. Big."" Predicted follow-up: the already shortened ""Fire and Water.""
"
FALSE,B,Highway,Free,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6868,"
I know you think they're dumb, but they're not, they're just slow, and this intelligent noise proves it. Every instrument in what is basically a trio format must make a solo-quality contribution, yet every one is held in check, by the tempos and the structures in which flash is strictly discouraged. The tension that results is more gripping here than on Fire and Water because vocalist Paul Rodgers and guitarist Paul Kossoff have mastered the reined-in expressiveness that comes naturally to drummer Simon Kirke and (especially) bassist Andy Fraser--last time they showed off, but this time you can hear them trying not to. Equally important, the tracks average 3:48 instead of 5:02. But though there are hints of melodic and verbal facility as well, there aren't enough.
"
FALSE,B,Free at Last,Free,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15523,"

FALSE,B,Stimulus Package,Freeway & Jake One,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14995,"
Known, moderately talented Philadelphia rapper whose gold album failed to make him a star on Roc-a-Fella in the good old early '00s hooks up with quality, deservedly solvent Twin Cities indie-rap label hungry for street cred. The co-billed producer is a Seattleite who works both sides of the cred street, the packaging elaborately impractical--paperboard wallet surrounded by giant Freeway/Jake One Bucks with lyrics etc. on back. And the CD reveals a talent as moderate as ever, still on the lookout for that ""pot of gold."" The standout ""One Foot In"" states the options he sees: ""I got one foot in the game one foot in the gutter/If my music don't bubble I feel sorry for your mother."" The Raekwon-enhanced hookmobile ""One Thing"" reserves special contumely for that lowly creature, the snitch. So I'm asking myself, is this ""reality""? Or is he fronting like so many hip-hop hards before him? Does ""criticizing"" his talent constitute snitching? Should I like him so nobody gets hurt? Poor Freeway. Poor Rhymesayers. Poor everybody.

FALSE,B,Sold American,Kinky Friedman,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6873,"
Too bad Kinky's unique cross between Don Rickles and Woody Guthrie extends to his singing. Doesn't matter on the lip-smackingly tasteless ""Ballad of Charles Whitman"" or the foolproof ""We Reserve the Right to Refuse Service."" But when he gets a leetle serious, as on the title song or the signature ""Ride 'Em Jewboy,"" you wish his voice could convey something of what he means.

Much as I admire Karen Durbin, Chip Stern, Terre Roche, Richard Goldstein, and Ellen Willis, to list only those commentators whose spoken overlays I recognize from personal conversation, I'm just as glad none of them was theorizing in my ear during last year's League of Gentlemen gigs at Irving Plaza, where Fripp's ""dance band"" sounded somewhat less dinky. And that goes double for J.G. Bennett.

FALSE,B,The Fun Boy Three,Fun Boy Three,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4835,"
This spinoff stretches the Specials even thinner--so thin it's like a minimalist statement, as if chants and jingles were the music of the people. And though ""The Lunatics"" is the only track I'm hooked on (I sing it for anyone within earshot and sound like Robert Goulet by comparison), it might be novelty album of the year if all the others achieved the rudimentary, skeptical charm of ""Faith, Hope and Charity"" and ""The Telephone Always Rings.""

FALSE,B,Cosmic Slop,Funkadelic,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1307,"
Thank, well, Whomever, the ""maladroited message of doom"" inside the doublefold comes not from Brother Malachi but from Sir Lleb, and Whomever has rewarded the band with two definitively scary takes on sex and life in the future present--""Cosmic Slop"" and ""No Compute,"" both of which combine humor, pessimism, incantation, and baloney in convincing and unprecedented amalgams. Unfortunately, most of the rest is ""interesting,"" including one profundo Vietnam monologue and many parodies of harmony-group usage.
"
FALSE,B,Fun Around the World,The Furies,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4838,"
Sticking their art-pop in your face, they write cute rock and roll tunes about their band, a famous band, an opera singer, a private museum, ""arts and crafts."" ""There is no difference between art and life,"" they warble; violence and pullution and Russia they know about from the San Fran Chronicle. Their best songs are about a female friendship (they ""talk about art"") and a lousy lover (the opera singer). Their candor is refreshing, their triviality not quite clever enough.
"
FALSE,B,Loose,Nelly Furtado,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13367,"
Although the Toronto hopeful remains an Intriguing Meld who identifies Latina and loves hip-hop, her Timbaland album has the paradoxical effect of bringing out the Canadian in her. Running the show for the attempted sex symbol is an undistinguished singer-songwriter hawking her Intriguing Meld. ""Maneater,"" ""No Hay Igual,"" and the Arab-Indian ""Wait for Me"" might accomplish God's great plan on the dance-floor. But as songs they're not much. Which doesn't stop the artist from pointing out that ""Maneater"" isn't solely about one of those mythical creatures--it ""speaks to the consumerist world we live in."" Oh really?
"
FALSE,B,On Fire,Galaxie 500,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1323,"
Who needs world-beat when indie darlings might as well be singing in Tagalog? I don't mean the words are physically or even semantically incomprehensible, either. Twinkies and decomposing trees and staring at the wall do break through the fog; motivated, I could probably construct a lyric sheet. But just like Lisandro Meza or Chaba Fadela, only not as well, what they produce for the curious outsider is a sound--halting, folk-psychedelic guitar signatures that establish each song's atmosphere. With George Harrison's ""Isn't it a pity"" the measure of their wisdom, verbal motivation isn't on the agenda.
"
FALSE,B,Dee Dee,Dee Dee Sharp Gamble,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4852,"
After ""Breaking and Entering"" and ""Let's Get This Party Started"" get the party started, Dee Dee torches into ""I Love You Anyway,"" written to a disaffected hub by none other than ex-hub Kenny G. This she brings off with such heartbrokenly matter-of-fact determination--all for show, I hope--that I felt ready for a whole side of slow ones. Which unfortunately I got.
"
FALSE,B,Hard,Gang of Four,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1327,"
This record is damn near dead on its feet, but I don't think the missing ingredient is Hugo Burnham's human chops so much as his humane spirit. The sick-soul-of-success lyrics are part of it--even their most received new-left truisms always had a sloganeering hookiness about them. What really makes the difference, though, is the detachment of Jon King's delivery. If I didn't know better, I'd wonder whether now he really wants to turn into Phil Oakey. And actually, I don't know better.
"
FALSE,B,Reflections,Jerry Garcia,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6883,"
Though it's slow going, this is the first sign in years that Jerry and Robert can still write songs. I said songs, Robert, not lyrics. But sometimes, as Allen Toussaint might put it (and Jerry does), I'll take a melody.
"
FALSE,B,Never Can Say Goodbye,Gloria Gaynor,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6891,"
The disco-hit side (three multi-percussed six-minute cuts, two of them Motown remakes) is a solid, danceable B plus. The flip (five shorter songs, the most irritating written by the singer herself) punches in at C or maybe lower. That averages out to B minus or maybe lower. But albums with listenable sides are all too rare these days.
"
FALSE,B,Ladies Invited,The J. Geils Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6896,"
So much better than Bloodshot that for a while I thought it was something special, and in a way it is--an r&amp;b album that includes a song about wind chimes. Would they were all as tuneful. Still, a lot of the ersatz-funk macho has disappeared from the lyrics, Peter Wolf's singing has picked up several layers of sweetness and nuance, and a couple of times they even try a harmony-group move. Inspirational Title: ""The Lady Makes Demands.""
"
FALSE,B,Selling England by the Pound,Genesis,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6904,"
The best rock jolts folk-art virtues--directness, utility, natural audience--into the present with shots of modern technology and modernist dissociation; the typical ""progressive"" project attempts to raise the music to classical grandeur or avant-garde status. Since ""raise"" is usually code for ""delegitimize,"" I'm impressed that on half of this Peter Gabriel makes the idea work: his mock-mythologized gangland epic and menacing ocean pastorale have a complexity of tone that's pretty rare in any kind of art. Even more amazing, given past performances, organist Tony Banks defines music to match, schlocky and graceful and dignified all at once--when he's got it going, which is nowhere near often enough. As for the rest, it sounds as snooty as usual.
"
FALSE,B,Georgia Satellites,Georgia Satellites,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8234,"
If you love ""Keep Your Hands to Yourself"" for its own raunchy self rather than appreciating the alternative it afford to Bon Jovi and Cyndi Lauper, you want this album. Opening the B is a bottleneck rocker that slides as hard as ""Happy,"" and while nothing else matches the inspiration of hit and follow-up, these guys do know how to put out those two-guitar basics. They just don't know why--except to provide an alternative to Bon Jovi and Cyndi Lauper. ""Happy,"" after all, never pretends to be anything more than a change of pace, and because Keith Richards understands its limits, he's lining up a new front man right now.
"
FALSE,B,Son of Obituary,George Gerdes,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6909,"
Gerdes has a weakness for the kind of high extruded wordplay that only the stoned survive, and he uses the word ""existential"" in two different songs. Of course, one time he's jesting, as is his wont; quite frequently these songs fall somewhere between the funny, the acerbic, and the wacked out, which ain't a bad place to be. But too often the joke--like the voice--wears thin.

Others marvel that this transplanted Aussie is white; I marvel that she's female. If she recalls Tina Turner it's Tina Turner in her (often overstated) rock mode, covering Lee Michael's ""Do You Know What I Mean"" and (the real giveaway) Chuck Berry's ""Come On."" And half the time she could almost be Paul Rodgers essaying a comeback. As if Paul Rodgers could make macho sound so human.
"
FALSE,B,Lotti Golden,Lotti Golden,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11710,"
With proper promotion from a big label, this might take off; her previous LP was promoted by Atlantic and went nowhere, but then, it was terrible. This time, Golden's egregious overstatement registers as a strength--her passion, even if affected, is intense enough to embarrass you.
"
FALSE,B,Somebody Else's Troubles,Steve Goodman,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6920,"
He wrote ""City of New Orleans,"" which is not on this album, and songs about car towing and organic food, which are. Also two consecutive songs about racing the sun, which is at least one too many. Tour de force: an a cappella ballad about a Vietnam widow. Arif Mardin found the proper setting for his young man's quaver.
"
FALSE,B,Jessie's Jig & Other Favorites,Steve Goodman,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6921,"
Very likable, bright and open and good humored, but like so many solo performers, folkies especially, he can't fill an album. This isn't a question of venality--Goodman is too honest to stretch himself onto a production schedule. But his talent requires mood changes more conspicuous than so subtle an instrumentalist, or so thin a vocalist, can provide. Remember groups?
"
FALSE,B,Say It in Private,Steve Goodman,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6922,"
If a smart journeyman like Goodman were consistently great, he'd be a genius, not a smart journeyman, and on one side the smart, slick songs attract interest without commanding it. But side two is a tiny folkie tour de force, drily reworking genre expectations so that we mourn Mayor Daley, sort of, bid a jolly farewell to our century, sort of, and know that Goodman's father is dead for real.
"
FALSE,B,Santa Ana Winds,Steve Goodman,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4873,"
Recorded shortly before Goodman died in October, this is a fitting testament to a likable artist who often went soft around the edges. Goodman's intelligence never quelled his appetite for bathos, be it honest (""I Just Keep Falling in Love""), parodic (""Fourteen Days""), or stupid (""The Face on the Cutting Room Floor""). He liked to laugh (""The Big Rock Candy Mountain""), but though he was a clever satirist (""Hot Tub Refugee""), his targets were rarely original (""Telephone Answering Tape""). And oh yeah--he did love music (""You Better Get It While You Can (The Ballad of Carl Martin)""). Since he never made an altogether convincing album, now would be the ideal time for the indie label he founded when the majors said bye to put together a big fat compilation. Wanna help out, Asylum? Buddah? Yeah sure.
"
FALSE,B,Rock Billy Boogie,Robert Gordon,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6925,"
Gordon's nouveau rockabilly has always been a mite slick and a mite fast, and this is his best album because he's no longer hiding it--his blown notes are just blown notes, not stigmata of authenticity. Credit Chris Spedding's unnaturally adaptable guitar, which drives the music more aptly than Link Wray's raw protohippie licks, authentic though they may have been. I mean, half the time Gordon actually sounds as though he belongs there. Blows some notes, though.
"

I've gotten to where I enjoy almost all of this a little, even the original compositions by Wray, who on every evidence except that of his guitar ought to retire to the Fools Hall of Fame. But it's nowhere near as exciting as Gordon's Tuff Darts album would have been; it's nowhere near as exciting as ""Red Hot,"" the only cut that jumps out at you the way this good ole rock 'n' roll is presumably supposed to; and it's nowhere near as exciting as the Gordon-Wray band on a good night, which is really the point. I've run into that confluence of events several times; if you haven't, you won't find this worth your time.

FALSE,B,Disco Nights,GQ,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6926,"
One great original, one good original, and well-chosen covers (from Billy Stewart and A Taste of Honey). Lots of vocal flexibility, sincerity, and spirit. In short, don't just buy the single, remember the name.
"
FALSE,B,Shinin' On,Grand Funk,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6932,"
Now this really is an American band--confident, healthy, schlocky, uncomplicated on the surface and supporting all manner of contradictions underneath. I prefer the title cut, which bursts with a--you should pardon the expression--raw power they've never managed before, to ""The Loco-Motion,"" where Mark sounds shaky. But how many bands get to record a ninth album, much less make it their best?
"
FALSE,B,Terrapin Station,Grateful Dead,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6938,"
Although this may be the Dead's best studio album since American Beauty, it runs a distant second, just nosing out the likes of Wake of the Flood, and will convert no one. In fact, it's a good thing Weir-Barlow's ""Estimated Prophet"" and Lesh-Monk's ""Passenger"" are the band's best originals in years, because Donna Godchaux's singer-songwriting debut is a disgrace; similarly, it takes a terse, jumping arrangement of ""Samson and Delilah"" to cancel out (and then some) a questionable ""Dancing in the Streets."" A confusion of quality also pervades the Garcia-Hunter title suite on side two. It works pretty well musically; for a while, I was ready to turn in the kazoo on ""Alligator"" for Paul Buckmaster. Then I listened to the lyric, a fable so polite it sent me hustling back to the verbal, vocal, and musical crudities of Anthem of the Sun, which ""Terrapin Station"" recalls formally. Amazing how all the hard-won professionalism of a decade disintegrates in the face of the sporadic, irresistible inspiration of their lysergic youth.

FALSE,B,What a Long Strange Trip It's Been: The Best of the Grateful Dead,Grateful Dead,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6939,"
In this uncommonly loving compilation, Dead head Paul Wexler does what he can to eliminate the fecklessly smug and the recklessly experimental. It coheres as well as Dead albums usually do, and offers two nice singles, which is nice. But ""Me and My Uncle,"" which hardly counts, is the only cover, a questionable decision. Plus--here's the real catch--four (out of eight) songs from Workingman's Dead, which coheres a good deal better.

Couldn't figure out why I found myself basically unmoved by this exquisitely sung collection of hymns, four of them familiar to me since my days in the First Presbyterian Church of Flushing. Then I realized that the Memphis groove of Al's first two Myrrh albums had somehow turned into rote tent-gospel timekeeping. Then I read the back of the album and learned that it was cut in Nashville, with all that implies. Which may also be why I know the material from First Pres. Going ""sacred"" on us, Al? Crossing over to the other side?
"
FALSE,B,Trust in God,Al Green,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4896,"
Al shouldn't let his originals out of Sunday school these days, but he's always had a way with the covers. ""Lean on Me"" and the rushed, simplistic ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" are too obvious, but elsewhere he's his usual catholic self (that's a small C, Al--look it up); here he takes over ""No Not One,"" which he found in an old church, and there ""Up the Ladder to the Roof,"" which he found on an old Supremes album. And the uptempo country rollick he makes out of Joe South's ""Don't It Make You Want to Go Home"" is up there with the downcast urban plaint he made out of the Bee Gees' ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.""

Dan Stuart and friends are as hooky as the L.A. trash aesthetic gets, with Chris Cacavas's organ the nugget. But though lots of New York bands ought to wish they'd thought of ""Aspirin"" first, Stuart would be easier to take straight if he didn't favor the B-movie imagery so prevalent in the film capital of the world.

Band's the same, and there's not a whole hell of a lot of distance between Jim Rooney, a marketwise old folk pro, and Tony Brown, a principled neo country pro. Yet Brown's production provides the soupcon of schlock that turns the raucous ""Ford Econoline"" into a landmark of country feminism as well as saving ""Trouble in the Fields,"" about noble victims selling the new John Deere to till their family farm with their own sweat and sinew. Too often, though, she's still a folkie playing just folks.

When the music's density and country-soul accent surround an obscurantist lyric like ""Seven Sleepers' Den"" you'd swear you were listening to the Band. But at times Jeffreys also achieves uncanny resemblances to M. Jagger and B. Dylan, which must be how he got to write ""They Call Me Fortune and Fame."" And he says more with good-time rockers like ""Sister Divine"" and ""Won't Ya Come Back Home"" than with ""Steven Sleepers' Den"" or ""An Imaginary Invalid."" Moliï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"

Unlike the hebephrenic country-rock clowns he superficially resembles--you know, the guys who make you want to run out and buy the complete works of Black Sabbath--Henry is really fun, dedicating one song to a porn-star friend of his and wooing Sweet Sassafrass on Eastern Parkway.

If I were gay, I imagine I'd love th is record, because it would be about me, which would certainly be a relief, but even so I'd complain about the husky forced sensitivity of the folkie voice and the now-and-again sugar of the string arrangements. As things stand I find myself touched by his slight lisp, engaged by his melodies, enlightened by his intelligence, and (sugar will out) moved almost to tears by the title song.

As a Canadian, Burton Cummings is no doubt aiming his ""symbolic"" rage more at the ""American"" than at the ""woman,"" but his choice of ""symbol"" is no less despicable for its putative naivete. I like the riff that goes with it, though, and except for the poetasting ""Talisman"" can find it in me to enjoy every cut on this record. The beat is unyielding as well as wooden, Randy Bachman's square yet jazzy guitar style is one of a kind, and the lyrics usually give up a phrase or two worth humming. AM fans should be proud.

Mix slide guitar with loose talk about sex, death, and, er, Negroes, and pass yourselves off as the Rolling Stones of the nuevo wavo.

That the folkie mind set dwells in the recording studio these days is a truth only new folk-rock songs as original as ""City of New Orleans"" can make me like. Instead, the best new tune here, Arlo's celebration of the Guthries' fiddling tradition, sounds suspiciously like a traditional fiddle tune. And I never had much use for ""Gates of Eden"" in its, er, authentic version.
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Arlo Guthrie,Arlo Guthrie,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=160,"
A best-of with a theme: The Rehabilitation of a Smart-Ass. Side one leads with ""Alice's Restaurant Massacre,"" retrieved from Arlo's otherwise amateurish debut, and then reprises two tuneful if soggy religious numbers. Side two leads with ""Motorcycle (Significance of the Pickle) Song,"" rescued from Arlo's unnecessary live collaboration with Uncle Pete, follows with the hippie-desperado anthem ""Coming Into Los Angeles,"" and then ""progresses"" into the reconciliation and nostalgia of Arlo's mature period. I have nothing against his mature period, but it's represented more cogently and unpredictably on Arlo Guthrie and Amigo. This would be more listenable, albeit less educational, if all the folk-punk stuff were on the same side.
"
FALSE,B,Outlasting the Blues,Arlo Guthrie,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6962,"
These reflections on God, love, and death are substantial and obviously earned, but too often they're just not acute. The problem isn't his religious overview, either--think of T-Bone Burnett. Guthrie simply goes soft aesthetically at crucial moments, and although most of the material is creditable enough, only once--on ""Epilogue,"" Guthrie's ""Under Ben Bulben""--is the enormous emotional potential of the project realized.

FALSE,B,One Kiss Leads to Another,Hackamore Brick,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6963,"
This audition tape by the Venus in Furs Society--a record collectors club whose firsthand contact with ""decadence"" consists of one DMT experience and moderate quantities of oral sex--bears a spooky resemblance to The Velvet Underground (LP number three, the lyrical one). Chick Newman's sour pitch has the deadpan emotional resonance of Lou Reed's, only folkier and more sanguine. The flat, droning beat is pure Maureen Tucker. And the organ solos are obviously an hommage to John Payne of the Serpent Power.

FALSE,B,Tunes From the Well,Bob Hadley,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11324,"
I love John Fahey, but I'm no aficionado of the school of solo guitar he's inspired--attempted visionaries like Robbie Basho and Leo Kottke lack his courage and clarity, while most of the others are just folkies with new chops. Hadley's a folkie, too--his vision is more earthbound than Fahey's. But it does deserve to be called a vision.

FALSE,B,Okie from Muskogee,Merle Haggard and the Strangers,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6964,"
Despite some slack performances, this album--recorded live during Haggard's first appearance in the city he made famous and vice versa, and the only LP to date to include any version of the title song--is a passable sampler. The wild crowd and predictable fooforaw--he gets an official Okie pin and the key to the city--give it documentary value. But The Best of Merle Haggard is a lot more representative of a great iconoclast who's keeping it under wraps these days. Tell us, Merle, just which college dean do you respect?

FALSE,B,It's Not Love (But It's Not Bad),Merle Haggard and the Strangers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6969,"
Merle hasn't played the poor boy in quite some time, but as he's turned into a legend he's all too often turned to gimmicky pseudo-concepts. This mainstream country album--his first since Hag--does more justice to its title than many of his more pretentious efforts. Nothing special, just marriage and its travails, but play it twice and you'll remember most of it.

FALSE,B,If We Make It Through December,Merle Haggard and the Strangers,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6970,"
Last time it was good to hear him go contemporary again. This time one of the two contemporary standouts sounds mysteriously like Bob Wills. The Lefty Frizzell and Floyd Tillman remakes come across fresh and clean. The Ink Spots remake doesn't.

FALSE,B,Eleven Winners,Merle Haggard and the Strangers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6973,"
Continuing Capitol's reclamation/exploitation of his last five or six years with the label, this compiles his best originals from the period. Pretty conventional--when he does try to add a little something (I like the play on ""grind"" in the trucking song), it's rarely quite enough.

FALSE,B,Big City,Merle Haggard,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4911,"
Having charged CBS considerable to slide into that notch on Billy Sherrill's gun, Merle signifies his seriousness by saving the flaky stuff for next year and clearing his throat before he sings. This isn't just for his cult--it's for the whole damn country audience. ""My Favorite Memory"" and ""I Always Get Lucky With You"" are love songs that may cloy eventually but at least stick for now. ""Big City"" and ""Are the Good Times Really Over"" are by the Merle who wrote that song about hippies. And just like on a real Nashville album, you can only tell how much filler there is by listening till you're sick of it.

FALSE,B,Songwriter,Merle Haggard,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4916,"
The best cuts here would make His Best better. But the real reason Haggard has never chalked up the great compilations a great country artist has in him is the reason MCA is perfectly justified in repackaging duff stuff like ""Red Bandana"" and ""From Graceland to the Promised Land."" On the country charts, those were hits--that's the way the country audience can be with great country artists. Best cut: the dangerously self-referential ""Footlights,"" which was never released as a single.

FALSE,B,Loud,Half Japanese,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4920,"
Art moves get a lot more half-assed these days than this musically illiterate atonal jazz-punk. The noise becomes wearing, and (ask DNA) professional recording would do wonders for the textures, but front man Jad Fair is hysterical in more ways than one, and both are appropriate. My favorite moments are his plans to trash his high school, his squalling baby routine, and his mysteriously sexy Doors cover.

FALSE,B,Our Solar System,Half Japanese,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4922,"
This is the band cultists love, give or take a few tokens of encroaching maturity--the tantrums are shorter and more entertaining, the musical forms marginally recognizable. Lots to laugh at, including an instrumental: ""Hall of the Mountain King""/""Louie Louie."" They don't have the chops for ""European Son,"" though.

FALSE,B,Along the Red Ledge,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6979,"
Do these guys still worry about being mistaken for the O'Jays? I suppose you could call them soulful, but in the style of one of those hairdressers (no imputation of sexual preference intended) who doubles as an unlicensed therapist. I admit that cut by cut and counting this is their most impressive album. Hall gets two tart ain't-love-a-bitch songs out of a broken romance that seems to have touched his ""heart,"" while Oates puts his name on homages to Aerosmith and Talking Heads. But it's docked a notch because after all these years I still don't know which one's the blond.

FALSE,B,Big Bam Boom,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4927,"
What makes these guys so depressing is their definitive proof that instinctive musicality insures no other human virtue. Rival popsters, Bruce and Cyndi included, don't do nearly as much for Arthur Baker's hip-hop dub, which in this context is sly and graceful and goofy and catchy and thrilling, and they even have the good taste to like, you know, soul. Yet if in the end you think the music doesn't connect, you get a gold star--the affluent anomie I wish were only a pop-sociology clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ pervades not just the lyrics but the mix itself.

Except for ""Ballad of Forty Dollars,"" a dispassionate account of a day in the life as a gravedigger, and ""Homecoming,"" a melodramatic account of a day in his life as a star, all the zingers here compiled are also available on better albums--albums that don't include songs of inspirational tolerance like ""I Washed My Face in the Morning Dew"" and ""One Hundred Children,"" which Hall executes no more wisely than any other mortal.

Counting Greatest Hits this is the fourth LP from Hall in about a year, and while it's better than the last one the workload still shows. The title isn't quite a misnomer, but he does seem to be cranking out them yarns instead of looking for his own truth within them, and for the second straight album the most impressive cut is a straight love song--""Souvenirs"" on We All Got Together, ""When Nobody Wants Your Body Anymore"" here. How about picking up some new material on a long vacation, T?

FALSE,B,You Can Sing on the Left or Bark on the Right,Dirk Hamilton,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6980,"
This is one of those records that makes me wish I wasn't in the grading business. I really like it a lot, to the point of positively loving one song, ""She Don't Squash Bugs,"" and getting a nice buzz every time I hear the opening lines of cut one. And while good words are the point, the good words are expressly musical; that is, they are designed for Hamilton's plosive drawl, a delivery in the general tradition of Van Morrison. Hamilton's earth mysticism recalls Morrison, too, and unlike Morrison he has a sense of humor. But also unlike Morrison, he has zilch gift for the hook; he's repetitive in the folk rather than the rock manner. So, all you subtlety fans (you know who you are) might take a chance.
"
FALSE,B,Shakin' That Rockabilly Fever,Billy Hancock & the Tennessee Rockets,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4930,"
Don't misunderstand--he wants to shake ""it,"" as it's called, not the fever, and sometimes he actually sounds hot. A Virginia boy whose career began in 1959, the year the singer turned thirteen and the music died, Billy gets off one classic rocker (""Please Don't Touch"") and one inspired medium-fast ballad (""Lonely Blue Boy""), venturing closer to the EP grail than such fellow semiauthentics as Ray Campi and Sleepy LaBeef, not to mention the current crop of hair sculptors. But he does it more with his will than his voice, and even though he comes by his affection for echo and hiccup naturally, they're still mannerisms that can't sound any more spontaneous after twenty-three years of adolescence.
"
FALSE,B,Love Needs,The Harptones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4935,"
With their serious tempos and platonic quest, the Harptones are archetypal doowop purists: even 1953's ""A Sunday Kind of Love,"" an acknowledged classic, failed to crease the national r&amp;b (or pop) charts. On this uncompromising album they almost get away with it because Willie Winfield, now fifty-three and a professional funeral director, retains the virtually characterless sapling tenor of a half-formed youth. Absolutely lovely--too absolute, in fact. Only on Jackson Browne's ""Love Needs a Heart,"" its lyric, melody, and vocal harmonies all touched with an uncharacteristically complex pain, do they achieve the transcendence they long for. Inspirational Verse: ""Take this for what it's worth/I am yours, you are mine.""

FALSE,B,Luxury Liner,Emmylou Harris,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1174,"
Not content with her corner on the wraith-with-a-twang market, some folk's favorite folkie manque has added funk and raunch and echo and overdub to her voice. The result is a record I play some, perhaps out of sheer surprise. Song selection also helps--an unforgettable Townes Van Zandt melody is unearthed, and the two Gram Parsons selections don't automatically shame themselves by recalling the originals.
"
FALSE,B,Wrecking Ball,Emmylou Harris,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1178,"
The reason Harris's instant comeback is an irritation, not a tragedy, is that the inspired collaborator and nonpareil backup singer has no vision of her own for Daniel Lanois to ruin. Her artistic personality has always been coextensive with her miraculously lucid voice, which now that it's fraying with age is ripe for Lanois's one seductive trick: to gauze over every aural detail and call your soft focus soul. I doubt she would have nailed the songs anyway--often she doesn't. But she would have come closer than this.
"
FALSE,B,Anything You Want,Wilbert Harrison,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6989,"
Let's Work Together was an anachronistic, even primitive r&amp;b album based on the fluke hit of the same name, which makes this the follow-up. Side one consists entirely of roll and rock songs you'd swear you've heard before--""Your Three Letters,"" eh, and what's this ""Let's Stick Together,"" and why not bring out ""Kansas City"" again? Very unprepossessing, very charming. In fact, if the second side weren't all standards and uncharming filler--only ""Sentimental Journey"" is even funny--I wouldn't be recommending this to r&amp;b diehards only.

FALSE,B,Rockbird,Debbie Harry,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=990,"
It's her achievement and her curse that just listening to the record you'd think she never went away. Vocal technique and vocal identity are sharper than when she withdrew from the fray five years ago, and the songs are brasher and more insouciant than on The Hunter or KooKoo or Autoamerican. If the sound could be a mite fresher, that's because the world is now overrun with the dance-rock Harry made possible--just as it's overrun with cartoon sexpots carrying tunes, whose collective existence give her a larger identity problem she refuses to confront. But it's also because the late '70s were Harry's heyday. Not too many pop icons get more than one of those.

Hartford's come a long way from ""Gentle on My Mind"" and eccentric bids for stardom. These days he sings mostly about the mighty Mississip (too thick to navigate, too thin to plow) and records eccentric river music for a folk label. He's slightly the better for it, on the whole--but I wouldn't say his living sounds so secure that he should turn down a gig on the Proud Mary. A gig playing, or a gig navigating.

Too bad one of the few disco albums that out-dollar-for-dollars the corresponding disco single is this super-efficient piece of rock funk, but deserving souls who dally with mechanization can't complain when bested by a real machine. Sole monkey wrench: the slow one, ""Time and Space,"" on which Hartman breaks his own rule by trying to write a meaningful lyric and then triples the misdemeanor by running it through his own larynx. Who does he think he is, Robert Plant? Machines can't sing.

FALSE,B,A Whole Nother Thang,Fuzzy Haskins,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1321,"
""Which Way Do I Disco"" and ""Sometimes I Rock and Roll"" set up an antinomy that George Clinton's second-favorite guitarist doesn't do much with. Both would have fit nicely onto Tales of Kidd Funkadelic, too--as would one (though not all three) of the love songs. Half a thang is the way I reckon it--or too many thangs.

""Fourth world music: classical by structure, popular by textural appeal, global-minded,"" explain the notes. The goal is worthy enough, the result basically friendly and weird, just like the year's Eno collaboration. But with Eno ancillary, the textural appeal is artier than necessary, from the muted trumpet stutter of the irritating opening cut to the sequenced fieldtape fragment of the centerpiece to the dust on the needle that conquers all before the finale is finalized.

FALSE,B,Happy Hour,Ted Hawkins,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4942,"
This L.A.-based folk bluesman can bring you up short by latching onto homely details or just telling the embarrassing truth. I'll never forget ""Bad Dog"" (""What's the reason your dog don't bark at that man?"") or ""You Pushed My Head Away"" (""Baby that sucker had to learn too""). But the unaffected can also be naive, and the unsophisticated can also be received. To ignore how often he falls into both traps is to condescend to an artist who deserves our respect.

If the 24-year-old Desser gets to be Lou Barlow when he grows up, which took Barlow years, he'll look back on most of these self-consciously casual vignettes as bores or embarrassments. He's best on young love, nice-guy style, especially when he and his girlfriend stay in bed all day. But the unnatural effort of extragenerational empathy makes him howl in agony. And if he really didn't know that the Susan Smith murders ""were gonna become a huge media thing,"" he hasn't yet learned the first thing about the impossible border between the private and the public.

It figures you'd find the heavy metal down toward the bottom of the barrel--still strong stuff, but except maybe for the ""Highway Chile"" riff and the sheer speed of ""Steppin' Stone,"" nothing springs out.

This one makes you listen--its abrupt shapes and electro/symphonic textures never whisper Eagles remake. So thank cocomposer, multi-instrumentalist, and occasional arranger Danny Kortchmar, whose ""You're Not Drinking Enough"" (Merle Haggard, call your agent) and ""All She Wants to Do Is Dance"" (T-Bone Burnett, ditto) are at once the simplest and most effective songs on the record. Then blame the turgid lengths, tough-guy sensitivity, and ""women are the only works of art"" on the auteur, who still thinks perfect love is when you're crazy and she screams.

FALSE,B,The Henry Cow Legend,Henry Cow,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7005,"
Composed to encourage improvisation, influenced by jazz yet identifying with Europe, and categorizable only as rock (although calling one cut ""Teenbeat"" is stretching things), the music of these Cambridge progressives is more flexible than King Crimson's and more stringently conceived than Soft Machine's. As is usual in this style, not everything works. As is also usual, the guitar (Fred Frith) carries more clout than the saxophone (Geoff Leigh). As is not usual, you can listen to what few lyrics there are without getting sick.
"
FALSE,B,In Praise of Learning,Henry Cow/Slapp Happy,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1521,"
This 1975 U.K. release was Cow's second collaboration with guitarist-composer Peter Blegvad, pianist-composer Anthony Moore, and vocalist Dagmar, and if it's less successful than the earlier Desperate Straights (still an import here), that's not the new guys' fault. Dagmar's abrasively arty, Weill-derived style, as bluesless and European as any ""rock"" singing ever recorded, does manage to find a context for words that seem literary if not pompous in print; in fact, between Dagmar and the Weillish Moore-Blegvad and Tim Hodgkinson music on side one, the lyrics seem almost as astute politically as the title. But except for some atonal Fred Frith piano, the music on side two is dominated by less than winning musique concrete experiments that make such injunctions as ""Arise Work Men and seize/the Future"" seem completely academic.

FALSE,B,Night Food,The Heptones,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7006,"
This reminds me that British skinheads were reggae fans--it shares its sexual brutality and rhythmic monotonousness with the most desperate and overbearing heavy rock. Saved by admirably intense and cogent vocal stylings and (I count) three good songs--not enough to really give such styling someplace to go.

I was about to note bemusedly that Herald's best songs on this album--""Wiggle Worm Wiggle"" and ""I'm Getting Ready to Go""--could have been written fifty years ago. Indeed they could have, because both are old bluegrass tunes. ""Slightly Blind"" and ""With Every Month"" are quite up-to-date. After that, details get hazy.
"
FALSE,B,Hangin' Around the Observatory,John Hiatt,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1776,"
Hiatt is a Midwestern boy who wrings off-center rock and roll out of a voice with lots of range, none of it homey. Reassuring to hear the heartland Americana of the Band actually inspire a heartlander. Reassuring too that one of the resulting songs can be released as a single by Three Dog Night.
"

I admit to a weakness for loony lyrical surrealist protest rockers. And I admit that this one tends to go soft when he tries to go poetic. I even admit that he has a voice many would consider worse than no voice at all (although that's one of the charms of the type). But I insist that anyone who can declaim about killing an ant with his guitar ""underneath romantic Indiana stars"" deserves a shot at leading man status in Fort Wayne.

FALSE,B,Two Bit Monsters,John Hiatt,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1779,"
Stupid that they're comparing this perennial future cult hero to Elvis C.--Hiatt beat Costello to his voice, such as it is, by four years. Still, a lyric like ""Back to the War,"" which sounds bitterly political and was probably inspired by an errant lover or business associate, makes me think twice, as does the impenetrable ""New Numbers."" When Costello is impenetrable, which is usually, he makes it look clever. And when Hiatt is penetrable, which is also usually, his cleverness varies.
"
FALSE,B,Warming Up to the Ice Age,John Hiatt,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1782,"
Commercial failure hasn't touched Hiatt's devotion to craft, but it's been hell on his sense of humor. He still cracks wise while rolling out the hooks, but the sprightly feel of Riding With the King has given way to a soulish hard rock that suggests he's satirizing all these bitter macho men in the first person because satire isn't the main idea.

FALSE,B,Where's the Money?,Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7009,"
If Hicks's acoustic stylings react against the excesses of counterculture futurists, then the key moment on this live album comes when he corrects ""his wife"" with ""I should say old lady"" and no one laughs. Hicks is delicate, tuneful, and droll, with an ear for colloquial history in words and music both, but he's so diffident about focus that his mock nostalgia is too easy to mistake for the right thing.

On Where's the Money? I had to work to figure out why I wasn't responding; on this one I have to think to figure out why I am. Well, dozens of touches--Hicks's musical wit is undiminished, with John Girton's acoustic plectra especially charming. But the words aren't sharp enough to cut the band's chronic cuteness.

Conservative rhythmically and conventional lyrically, this is the reggae equivalent of Otis Clay-style soul, yet it'll come this close to getting you: the style is so modest that the singer has no trouble burnishing up the requisite patina of sweet belief.

In which the concentrated energy of Memphis power pop--the upside-down Beatles VI style pioneered by Alex Chilton's Big Star--defines itself as a regional sound, albeit one that has been confined almost entirely to the studio.

Despite one soupy instrumental, one soupy hit, and one soupy song of putative faith, the general air of unrelieved vapidity here only enhances yet another bright, slick, well-crafted album by our own Five Lads.

I love the Rounders chronicle and the theory of Western civ and the pornographic reminiscence but I wish there were times and credits in the liner notes too because I don't feel like putting a watch on what I estimate as fifty-plus minutes of random canon and also because I wonder whether Steve Weber and maybe Luke Faust and Robin Remailly are putting out and in addition I prefer Dave Van Ronk's ""Random Canyon"" to Peter Stampfel's and would just as soon Peter recut ""Nova"" and ""Synergy"" as well but he probably designed the album to sound like a field recording which I'm sure is just what the Folks-with-a-capital-F at the Rounder collective wanted since this isn't traditional enough for them and maybe it's also too traditional for me but I doubt it.

FALSE,B,Cracked Rear View,Hootie and the Blowfish,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1543,"
Even when they split the difference between jangle and boogie, bands given to blunt popcraft and elementary guitars generally favor singers up toward the whiny end of the dramatic spectrum. So Darius Rucker's gruff grit adds an extra layer of substance to a music already deeply comforting in its formal certainties. As a black man who takes his vocal cues from what Gregg Allman made of blues and soul, not to mention a black man embraced as eagerly as Carl McCall by white people loath to think of themselves as ""prejudiced,"" he's significant, with ""Drowning"" one more hit about racism than Tupac or Dr. Dre has bothered with. But since both patterns can be traced to late minstrelsy--by which I mean not the whiteskin brainwash of perfervid radical rhetoric, merely the twisted roots of American pop--he's hardly unprecedented. And whatever his significance, a cornball is a cornball is a cornball.

You can tell these sardonic folkies have big plans because they've come up with a slogan: ""neoprimitive bug music,"" which definitely beats ""the Ithaca sound."" Overimpressed with Philip Glass, bluegrass, or both, they utilize lots of repetition. Very hypnotic, or strophic, or static. Also kind of tedious, like the grim life-cycle they so often evoke--a little goes a long way, which I guess beats nowhere. Check out the Cramps cover.

Vocally, this group can't match the Emotions, and the music for some of these songs is undistinguished, but I'll take their hit (""Angel in Your Arms,"" not to be confused with ""Undercover Angel"") for its modestly articulate modern moralism, a virtue many of the lyrics here share.

Errol Brown used to pose interesting questions, mostly about race, and though his conclusions were often quizzical or incoherent, they tended to be more provocative (if no more militant) than ""Love Is the Answer One More Time."" There are four good songs here and no utter losers, but one of the good ones is already on 10 Greatest Hits, and only ""Confetti Day,"" another installment in this strange group's family series, is up to the title chartbuster. Maybe that's because the question that really interests Brown these days is how to integrate synthesized percussion into English soul-pop.

FALSE,B,Mystery,Hot Chocolate,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1552,"
Maybe the reason Errol Brown's never broken through Stateside is the inscrutability that's always made him such a provocative pop figure--he gives you nothing to hold on to but the hook. And though his hooks have never been more abundant, I'm beginning to wish I knew why he took so much trouble.

Played this because I liked the band's name, played it some more because I liked the singer, played it a lot more because I'm in the market for bohos to believe in. Meri St. Mary may not be the cross between Lou and Patti her label claims, but she's at least a female Bob Pfeifer, with nice sharp words--""Wild wimmin don't die/They just dye their hair/And get on out of town,"" or ""Doesn't he know that we'd still like him/Even if he was one of the Rolling Stones?""--to go with the nice sharp Lou/Patti arrangements.

Black up the leader's cuspids and change their name to Garageland or London Calling and they could play any tribute bar between Boston and D.C. Only difference is they write their own anthems and don't fake any Cockney--when you start out in German, singing English is tribute enough. And though they won't make you love it, I bet they could make you like it--there's more spirit in their frank, admiring imitation than in the ersatz originality of whichever hybrid is tearing out the alternative playlists this week.

FALSE,B,Ian Hunter,Ian Hunter,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1583,"
""Once Bitten Twice Shy"" and ""I Get So Excited"" are rockers as primo as any but the greatest Mott the Hoople songs, and as a bonus the latter is about something besides rock and roll. Hunter and coproducer Mick Ronson's passion for that subject is justified by the rest of the music, even the poetry-with-rock episode. But Ian should remember that it's a mighty long way down rock and roll, because as your name gets hot your heart gets cold. Then your name gets cold.

FALSE,B,You're Never Alone With a Schizophrenic,Ian Hunter,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1584,"
Six winners out of nine on this mini-comeback, and he doesn't seem to be straining, either. But that's not entirely a blessing--the musical territory is conventionally good-rockin', and only on the gnomic ""Life After Death"" and the second verse of ""When the Morning Comes"" does he reconnoiter lyrically. The titles of the bad songs--""Bastard,"" ""The Outsider,"" and ""Ships"" (in the guess what)--are warning enough.

Us snockgrass fans didn't await this long-awaited album quite long enough--sounds as if Hurley padded over to the studio before he was done with his nap. I know it's always sleepy time up north in Wolfville, and Hurley obviously spent part of his four-year vacation thinking about seven new originals. But except for the . . . climactic ""Open Up (Eternal Lips),"" even the best of them get lost on their way to the outhouse. Inspirational Insert: ""Feel free to tape this album: Blue Navigator is not soley [sic] a commercial venture but is intended for a spiritual life far out traveling the destination of one arrow.""

With heavy help from DJ Afrika Islam, this reformed criminal is the rap equivalent of pimp-turned-paperback-writer Iceberg Slim. Can't know whether his streetwise jabs at Reagan and recidivism will make a permanent impression on his core audience, but his sexploitations and true crime tales are detailed and harrowing enough to convince anybody he was there. Wish I was sure he'll never go back.

Don't stop for ""Don't Stop"" or touch ""The Untouchables,"" but ""Dancing With Myself"" is DOR's theme song, and ""Mony Mony"" works almost as well as it did for his great preceptor Tommy James. Would Billy were as principled, but these are cynical times, and they like Billy just the way he is.

Even in punk's heyday he obviously wanted to be a teen idol, but back then he couldn't very well admit that his hero was Elton John. Yet here he is with Kiss's manager and an album that rocks as hard as the first side of Caribou--for three cuts, including a hit single and ""White Wedding,"" a call to innocence regained as desperate and persuasive as ""Start Me Up."" If he could keep it going I'd be happy to buy my pop from a phony, but neither Burundi beats nor overzealous voice practice do anything but accentuate the jaded professionalism that takes over.

It's a mild up to run into the old hardcore idealism, and somehow no surprise that the singer's brother to the producer, too-idealistic-for-this-world straight-edge avatar Ian MacKaye. The lyrics avoid the excesses of hardcore rant and posthardcore doubt without rejecting the truth of either--or equalling the evolutionary smarts of the guitar. Attack's tough, minimal, fast but no longer speedy. High points are slow side-closers: ""Strain"" with its honest struggle and pain, ""Lucky Thirteen"" with its Flipper refrain.

After laying low for a couple of years, George Clinton enlists a new bunch of unsuspecting young people into P-Funk Mark VIII (Plus or Minus III), so say ho. His mid-'80s electrowhomp is in place, and the catchy lounge-rocker wasn't stolen from the Main Ingredient or somebody. But with ""jack"" the keyword and ""chiropracter"" and ""androgynous"" the polysyllables, he never comes up with the catchphrase that reestablishes his street connection--not even a ""Do fries go with that shake?"" Which may be why the electrowhomp shows its technics.

FALSE,B,Love's So Tough,Iron City Houserockers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7053,"
""Turn It Up"" is one of those self-transcending cliches--a song about rock and roll escape that reveals how the truism became one. Most of the others are honorable cliches--working-class angst played for tragedy rather than irony or analysis in the great tradition of B. Springsteen. Or is it T. Lizzy?
"
FALSE,B,I.O.U.,Gregory Isaacs,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5015,"
Isaacs evolves so slowly that he'll still be catching up with pop history when he's 70, which makes keeping up with him less fun than quality music ought to be. Like Smokey, he's given up on songwriting and production, yet musically he's deeper now than five years ago: when Gussie Clarke tells him to lead with an unskanking soul-ballad groove, he gets into it no questions asked--like he owns it. Politically, however, he's disappeared, and since one of his charms was how naturally he yoked resistance and romance, he falls on just the wrong side of the almost imperceptible margin between the crafty and the generic. Though if Clarke had come up with more sound effects like the warbling electronic cricket hiding in the underbrush of ""Report to Me,"" I'd never think to mention it.
"
FALSE,B,Silvertone,Chris Isaak,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5016,"
Like his East Coast counterpart Marshall Crenshaw, Isaak comes to his sources as a professional musician, not a bohemian dabbler. This is attractive, only his sources aren't as rich as Crenshaw's, and neither is his talent. Reflective modernized rockabilly played for echoing atmosphere.

FALSE,B,Chris Isaak,Chris Isaak,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=595,"
For me, the almost genteel formalism and romanticism of this dreamy foray into rockabilly's dark, hurtful, sensitive side is epitomized by the fiddle-as-violin that adds its sad color deep behind ""Fade Away."" Don't get me wrong, it sounds good. Whole damn thing sounds good. 
"
FALSE,B,Ain't No Backin' Up Now,Isis,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7054,"
On their Shadow Morton-produced debut this brassy ten-woman ensemble sounded like a cross between Vanilla Fudge and the Mount St. Mary's College Lab Band, but here Allen Toussaint's horn arrangements cut a channel for their melodrama. As is usual on Toussaint albums, the side that features his songs is a lot stronger than the side that features the band's. Now if only he could describe lesbian life as knowledgeably as Carol MacDonald in ""Bobbie and Maria"" or Jeanie Fineberger in ""Eat the Root."" But that would be a lot to ask.
"
FALSE,B,Get into Something,The Isley Brothers,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7055,"
Five of the ten tracks on this album were r&amp;b hits, and even ""Girls Will Be Girls,"" a silly song that does not reflect ""Take Inventory""'s astonishing views on the subjection of women, has its pleasures. But none of them went pop--or tore up the r&amp;b charts--because none of them was more than a serviceable rehash. The first side rocks, the second side fluctuates, and let's hope they get into something else soon.
"
FALSE,B,Givin' It Back,The Isley Brothers,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7057,"
An exciting album in theory--cover versions by a genuinely ""progressive"" (at least self-contained) soul act of eight (mostly) excellent (mostly) rock songs. But only ""Spill the Wine"" (previously a progressive r&amp;b hit), ""Love the One You're With"" (previously a progressive rock hit), and ""Ohio"" (no complaints) are exciting in practice. Ernie Isley just can't match Jimi's ""Machine Gun,"" and soul is wasted on ""Fire and Rain"" and ""Lay Lady Lay,"" which are more powerful in their understated originals.
"
FALSE,B,"Brother, Brother, Brother",The Isley Brothers,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7058,"
Although the three Carole King songs seem a little tame after ""Ohio"" and ""Cold Baloney,"" her simple messages fit the Isleys' lyrical-to-smarmy gospel credulousness quite neatly. But it's only on the three Isley originals that top off side one that this album makes itself felt, and interestingly enough none of them could be called ""progressive"": ""Lay Away"" and ""Pop That Thang"" are infectious groove tunes, while ""Work to Do"" is a compelling assertion of male prerogatives whose dire potential was presaged in 1969, when R.B. Greaves found himself forced to swap his wife for his secretary. Love and money, love and money--it's a polarity that tears you apart even more when they give you a (long) shot at both.

"
FALSE,B,The Heat Is On,The Isley Brothers,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3658,"
This is well-nigh flawless Isleys--the rockish electric textures are muted nicely on side two, ""Fight the Power"" does its bit to politicize the radio, and Seals &amp; Crofts won't steal any lyrics. But Ronnie Isley isn't getting any less unctuous--when he tries to talk someone into bed he recalls one of those guys who started wearing love beads to singles bars in 1968 or 1969. Progress requires ambition, but the two aren't identical.
"
FALSE,B,Go For Your Guns,The Isley Brothers,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3659,"
By the time the competent enough first side was over, I felt completely fed up with their mellifluous bullshit, especially since I'd noticed the title ""Voyage to Atlantis"" on side two. But that disaster excepted side two is the most hard-edged they've recorded since moving T-Neck to CBS in 1973. Needless to say, the one about ""Climbin' Up the Ladder"" is even more passionate than the one about ""Livin' the Life."" Nor is it surprising that the title tune has no lyrics at all. There's no riot goin' on.
"
FALSE,B,Showdown,The Isley Brothers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7064,"
Disco has been good for this band musically: the chic guitar-and-chant of the title tune, the slow, sensuous funk of ""Groove With You,"" and the enigmatic air of ""Ain't Givin' Up No Love"" are refreshing variants on their basic moon-and-vroom, and both ""Rockin' the Fire"" and ""Take Me to the Next Phase"" are pure dance-peak ideology. Doesn't do much for their politics, though.

FALSE,B,Rock Me Tonight,Freddie Jackson,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5022,"
To compare the latest platinum love man to Marvin Gaye is to ignore his voice. If Luther Vandross relaxed more and (what may be the same thing) sold himself love man first and singer second, this is how he'd sound. A pure make-out record--mellow groove, mellow sound. Just lie back and enjoy it.
"
FALSE,B,Control,Janet Jackson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5023,"
I scoffed at Janet's claims of autonomy--figured Jam &amp; Lewis wrote her in as collaborator for a price she could afford. But she must have had some input--otherwise what would be not to like? Great beats here, their deepest ever. If her voice ever changes, she may even live up to them--and convince the world she's her own woman. Till then she's just playing, which does have its entertainment value.
"
FALSE,B,Look Sharp!,Joe Jackson,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1734,"
In which an up-and-coming professional entertainer tricks up Britain's latest rock and roll fashion with some fancy chords and gets real intense about the perils of romance. Well, better ""Is She Really Going Out with Him?"" than ""Sunday Papers,"" the social-criticism interlude, which inspires fond memories of ""Pleasant Valley Sunday.""

Put this on the shelf in front of Bowie's Pin Ups, Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll, and Costello's Almost Blue. Granted, Jackson doesn't sing as well as any of them, not to mention Cab Calloway or Louis Jordan, who originated most of the '50s r&amp;b novelties here revived. But he obviously gets a kick out of this stuff, and that counts for something. What counts for much much more is that MCA has slipped three budget Louis Jordan compilations into better record stores.
"
FALSE,B,Beat Crazy,Joe Jackson Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5027,"
Just in case Jackson is about to turn into last year's model for good, I thought I'd mention that I kind of like his poorest-selling album. The melodies escape me as usual, but the beat is getting tougher and more resilient and the lyrics are at their best. Granted, the social comment and romantic reflections still sound smug at times, but anybody who can justify a dedication to Linton Kwesi Johnson (""Battleground"") and say something new about fooling-around-on-the-road (""Biology"") hasn't thrown it in yet.
"
FALSE,B,It Hurts So Good,Millie Jackson,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7080,"
A hint of concept brings the tracks on this album together--on side one she's playing up to her man, while on side two she's playing around--and the production mixes (alternates, really) Holland-Dozier-Holland and Norman Whitfield, with guest Brad Shapiro adding the occasional modernism, all of which makes for instructive contrasts with Jackson's definitely unsubtle attack. But if there isn't a bad track on the record, there isn't a compelling one either, and in pop that's the kiss of obscurity if anything is.
"
FALSE,B,Feelin' Bitchy,Millie Jackson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7084,"
Fuck this ten-pop-tunes shit, Millie says. Almost literally--the FCC will not approve. She's appealing more explicitly to her black audience, too, and has apparently returned to concepts--or rather, messages, two of them. The second side says ""Don't cheat"" and the first side says ""Eat pussy."" The first side is definitely more fun.
"
FALSE,B,For Men Only,Millie Jackson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5035,"
This starts with a bang--Millie's unemployed husband hits her. And for a while she runs with it, giving no quarter to either side in the sexual war. But then the plot blurs over into an ill-conceived affair that only heats up when Millie says no. She's very good at saying no. She's not such a hot ballad singer.
"
FALSE,B,I Had to Say It,Millie Jackson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5036,"
Who better to do a rap parody--a damn funny one first few times through, closes with MJ invited into the KKK. I like the infidelity-on-the-road piece, too, and note that much of side two--""I Ain't No Glory Story,"" the Philip Mitchell duet, ""Ladies First"" (and you'd better last)--tops For Men Only. But either Millie's growing weary of her shtick or we are--she sounds bone tired.
"
FALSE,B,Lookin' Through the Windows,Jackson 5,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7071,"
They're wonders of nature no longer, but they're still a good group, and this snaps back toward the usual marvelous Motown multiplex. Jackson Browne's specifically late-adolescent ""Doctor My Eyes"" brings Michael along too fast, but it sounds good on the radio. And Jermaine (I think) proves equal to Ashford &amp; Simpson's specifically adult ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing."" Recommended ballad: ""If I Could Move a Mountain."" Continuing a great tradition: ""E-Ne-Me-Ne-Mi-Ne-Moe.""
"
FALSE,B,All Mod Cons,The Jam,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3666,"
Far from the posers cynics believe them to be, these guys are almost painfully sincere, and on this album their desire to write commercial songs that say something is palpable and winning. Unfortunately, their success is mixed at best, and the music is so tentative that I was surprised by how hard they made a set of new material rock in concert. But last year's set rocked even harder. And though I can overlook the record's gaffes and forced lines and faint playing in the aftermath of the show, I'm too much of a cynic to believe the glow will last.
"
FALSE,B,The Jam,The Jam,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5056,"
There are two theories about these guys--one that they're getting better, the other that they're getting worse. As you might fear, this interim product (""5 British Hit Singles,"" boasts the sticker, so imagine how excited they are in Britain) proves both--songwriting up, punk excitement gone forever.
"
FALSE,B,The Gift,The Jam,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5057,"
It's easy to understand why this is Britannia's favorite band--their dedication is very winning. Nobody plays ex-punk quasifunk with less ostentation or more skill, and Paul Weller goes Springsteen one better--not only is he working-class, he's young. As usual, his good-heartedness is palpable here. He takes on suburban racism, nine-to-five fatigue, even general strike without talking down or claiming exemption from sin. And if he's written half a dozen good melodies since he stopped settling for Who hand-me-downs, three of them have passed me by.
"
FALSE,B,The Bitterest Pill,The Jam,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5058,"
Fan fodder there, where Paul Weller is a god; cult fodder here, where he's an artist. It made sense for him to revive a Pete Townshend obscurity on his previous EP-in-waiting, and the arty horn and bassline touches on the evergreen ""War"" are not without interest. But only worshippers want his ""Fever."" In fact, agnostics aren't sure about the title tune either.
"
FALSE,B,Stutter,James,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5059,"
These Lancashire lads have staked out their own kitchen garden on guitar-bass-and-drums' densely cultivated common. Folkedelic with hints of postpunk-pop, it's a place pleasant, unkempt, and all their own, but not private enough to suit them--hence their wry, well-meaning, angst-ridden, and ultimately impenetrable lyrics.
"
FALSE,B,Etta James Sings Funk,Etta James,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7091,"
As you can read on the back, funk isn't a style or something like that--it's just, well, Etta. Etta with chorus, Etta with full brass, Etta with strings even. Etta singing a Gershwin song, Etta singing a Bee Gees song, Etta singing three Acuff-Rose songs, Etta singing four Pearl Woods songs. (Pearl Woods?) Highlights: the Acuff-Rose songs.
"
FALSE,B,Etta James,Etta James,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7093,"
Gabriel Mekler (of Steppenwolf, Kozmic Janis, Nolan Porter) introduces Etta to the rock audience with three Randy Newman covers plus, and it almost works. To hear this gospel-trained ex-junkie turn ""God's Song"" into a jubilantly sarcastic antihymn is to know why pious blacks consider blues devil music, and Tracy Nelson fans should hear how low ""Down So Low"" can get. James is full-bodied, bitter, hip without sounding educated about it. But she has trouble finding a female persona for ""Sail Away"" and ""Leave Your Hat On."" And she has trouble making anything at all out of Mekler's own stuff.
"
FALSE,B,Etta Is Betta Than Evvah!,Etta James,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7095,"
What a mess. The side-openers--""Woman (Shake Your Booty)"" (she's dirty and she's proud) and ""Jump Into Love"" (""You gotta wallow in it,"" opines a lowdown male chorus)--promise an album of raunch after all that classy stuff. But except for a literal version of King Floyd's ""Groove Me,"" the only other raunch here is Randy Newman's ""Leave Your Hat On,"" which Mekler originally produced. Makes a lot more sense in this context.
"
FALSE,B,Deep in the Night,Etta James,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7096,"
Most of James's albums suffer from radical unevenness; this one is marred by its consistency. Producer Jerry Wexler's song choices are as tastefully imaginative as his arrangements, but James has never had much midrange, and her versions of (good) material from such luminaries as Kiki Dee, the Eagles, and Alice Cooper are inferior to the originals. She doesn't get much out of ""Piece of My Heart,"" either. That said, I'll admit to enjoying side two--opening with a jaunty ""Lovesick Blues"" and touching base at gospel (Dorothy Love Coates), soul (Allen Toussaint), and r&amp;b (revamping her own ""I'd Rather Go Blind""). But it's still a little boring. Which means it's not the real Etta.

Eight cuts designed for dancing by Ian Dury's departed keyboard genie, with Dury-penned rhymes that beat Lord Upminster's and sweetly anonymous treated vocals by the auteur. If only I was dancing more these days.
"
FALSE,B,Treasure Island,Keith Jarrett,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11685,"
If Jarrett's Solo Concerts are too statusy and static, then this moves with a suspiciously unambitious ease--it's true to all its own assumptions, only it assumes too little. When he is on (e.g., Fort Yawuh) Jarrett can conjure beauty out of chaos and agitation out of peace. All he comes up with here is pleasant little surges of melody.
"
FALSE,B,Death and the Flower,Keith Jarrett,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11519,"
Jarrett has the kind of gift that is labeled genius because it's so hard to put down. But for a genius, he makes an awful lot of music that can best be described as pleasant. Granted that its pleasantness is substantial and sensual and spirited all at once. Granted too that the accomplishment of this album is more reliable than that of his last group effort, Treasure Island. I still expect more from a genius.

FALSE,B,Doing It to Death,The J.B.'s,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7104,"
The consumerist-conservationist in me is appalled by the whole idea of J.B.'s records, which are basically another way for James Brown to spread himself thin. The title riff is the best he's come up with since There It Is--two soundtracks, a compilation, a studio double, and another J.B.'s album ago--and might have been put to better use elsewhere. On the other hand, the whole first side is adequate James Brown--that is, pretty damn good. The second side stretches Brown out on organ, never my favorite vehicle for his talent. Theme song: ""You Can Have Watergate Just Gimme Some Bucks and I'll Be Straight."" Lot of different ways to take that.

A puzzler: I've listened many times and cannot make contact. Every time Grace lilts out ""Up against the wall, motherfuckers"" ( a phrase which has long since lost its currency and dubious usefulness) I want to laugh, and I don't find the instrumental cuts very inspired.

FALSE,B,Early Flight,Jefferson Airplane,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7108,"
Artists are always claiming embarrassment at the unauthorized release of their early work, but this group owns the company, so I guess they know no shame. They ought to--not about these nine cuts, six recorded in 1965-66 and three in 1970, but at how played out the band has become. The two originals with Signe Anderson are early Airplane at their folkie-trippy worst, although ""High Flying Bird"" is fine, but even the six-minute blues jams, one with Jorma and one with Marty, sound more alive than all their space operas. The 1970 single ""Mexico,"" about Nixon's dope crackdown, is their finest recording of the decade. And ""Have You Seen the Saucers,"" the B side, sounds more alive than all their space operas too.

FALSE,B,American Boy and Girl,Garland Jeffreys,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7117,"
Jeffreys has never shown much knack for love songs, and he's not getting any better with melodies either, which means that half of this encouraging comeback gets by on his acumen as a singer and bandleader. But as you might expect from somebody who rhymes ""you know what it's like"" with ""Wilhelm Reich,"" he retains his feeling for cafe society and his sense of the street, which synthesize into his eternal theme of making it. And while you might suspect him of sentimentalizing the street kids on the cover, he doesn't--he just cares about them, that's all.

Jeffreys and his band (four cheers for the Rumour) are on top of this live material.

""People my age, 25 to 40, who grew up as Cold War babies, we don't have anybody writing music for us. There's a lot of formula rock aimed at the 11-year-old market, and there's a lot of MOR for people over 50. But this is an album dealing with us, and our American experience--guilt, pressures, relationships, and the whole Vietnam syndrome."" Imagine--in a world where formula rock, MOR, and most of the in between is guilty of association with Billy's (and my) demographic, he talked that shit. OK, you say, so he's no sociologist, and though sociological aptitude does tend to clarify ""experience,"" I'll let it pass. What shocks me is the realization that this consummate rock professional is working on instinct. The basic belief of Cold War babies is that anything less than everything is a cheat, and their piano man agrees. Sure, ""Allentown"" digs into the rust belt. Right, ""Goodnight Saigon"" ain't Rambo. And in the relationship songs, sexual politics rads like me were fretting about a decade ago come home to haunt guys who thought they were a crock. But always this music feeds off a sense of deprivation that transcends specifics--it's built into the psyche of the singer and his audience. Does it help that the John Lennon impression (signifying seriousness) vies with the Paul McCartney impression (signifying entertainment value)? You bet. But he's no less deluded than his audience.

Maybe his youthful lyricism, meaning his knack for the tearjerker, is abandoning him.

A lot of people consider John a future superstar, and they may be right; I find this overweening (semi-classical ponderousness) and a touch precious (sensitivity on parade). It offers at least one great lyric (about a newborn baby brother), several nice romantic ballads (I don't like its affected offhandedness, but ""Your Song"" is an instant standard), and a surprising complement of memorable tracks. But their general lack of focus, whether due to histrionic overload or sheer verbal laziness, is a persistent turnoff.

Two LPs ago, Bernie Taupin passed on his way from obscure banality to clean, well-lighted banality to write a batch of imaginative lyrics, and set to those lyrics John's music sounded eclectic but not confused. Too often now it seems to chatter on anonymously. The title cut is good, ""Bennie and the Jets"" is great, side four is good-to-great, and a few other songs here would probably benefit from more exclusive company, but this is one more double album that would make a nifty single.

You say you don't care that it's his best album in seven years? I swear, you young people have no respect. This little guy was a giant, helped keep us sane back then, and though it's true he hasn't come up with a ""Honky Cat"" or ""Bennie and the Jets"" (""I Am Your Robot"" might qualify if there were still AM radio), it's gratifying enough that after all these faithful years he's started to get good songs out of Gary Osborne (gunning for a Frank Sinatra cover on ""Blue Eyes"") as well as Bernie Taupin (who really shouldn't ever write about politics).

The bitch is gone, presumably forever. Never an artist you looked to for aesthetic principle, John provided a nice ersatz hard rock before punk and metal split that alternative down the middle. So he sunk to the depths and then resurfaced as an '80s pop singer. No point comparing him to Springsteen or Costello when he's competing with Barry Manilow, to whom he's infinitely preferable, and Billy Joel, who gets the decision on aesthetic principle. His only classic of the period is ""Sad Songs (Say So Much),"" which is much faster than most of these hits. It's not especially sad, either--and ""I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues"" isn't a blues.

Johns is a local hero, a rock and roll crazy who lives for the music and whose undeniable gift doesn't do justice to the magnitude of his devotion. After years of fringe rockabilly in D.C., relocating to Austin has brought out the Doug Sahm in him. On ""guitars, vox organ, lap steel, upright and electric bass, slide, harmonica, and lead vocals,"" he rolls out tune after generically catchy tune in his somewhat raspy drawl. Most of them are about purty girls and hellacious wimmin, but I can't even claim he deserves the latter, because the specifics just aren't there--the words are unfailingly good-humored and never anything more, including funny. My favorite cut is an instrumental named after its entire lyric, ""Hey Whew!,"" but those so enamored of authenticity that they fake it can fool their collector fans by covering ""Life Sentence in Love"" or ""Love Is Murder"" or ""Moonshine Runner"" or ""My Baby, She Left Me.""

Note label, imagine formula. A good one, of course--as the horns ascend over bass and drums you half expect him to break into ""You Ought to Be With Me"" or ""Here I Am."" Unfortunately, the voice is too narrow and nasal to take full advantage of such a smooth approach--good thing he gets gritty now and then. Mistake: Jerry Vale's (and Ray Charles's) ""You Don't Know Me,"" which sounds like something Al thought better of.

One of the artiest cover illustrations ever to come out of Nashville has misled casual observers into the belief that this is a concept album about George and Tammy's marital problems. What it is is a slightly better-than-average George Jones LP marred by a surfeit of conjugal-bliss songs. First by a country mile: ""Billy Ray Wrote a Song,"" about two up-and-coming Nashville professionals, both male.

The vocals aren't as intense here as on Alone Again, so the tomfoolery seems a little forced, though I hope he keeps trying. But as long as he's not buried in strings, soul choruses, and Peter Allen songs, I don't think he can make a bad album. Will somebody tell Billy Sherrill to withdraw that call to Australia?

This not-great George Jones record should reassure anybody who was worried he'd never make another decent one without hitting the bottle again. First side leads off with messages to wives of various periods, second with a Jones-penned chestnut that happens to be the title of his new bio, a great pseudofolksong (or maybe it's real, which is what makes it great), and a very cheerful explanation of why he'll never hit the bottle again. We believe you, George.

FALSE,B,First Time Live,George Jones,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5096,"
If it's amazing that this inexhaustible record machine has never resorted to a live quickie, it's doubly amazing that he's never dared one. Less amazing is the career moment it captures, the period of sobriety that's turned his never-ending stage fright into shtick. ""No Show Jones"" opens the show, naturally, and this being country music it kicks off with his guitarist's Merle Haggard imitation. Elsewhere there's a set-down-a-spell band feature, a get-it-over-with medley, and the usual quota of you-had-to-be-there cornball, which Jones, whose stage fright isn't altogether irrational, delivers pretty clumsily for a thirty-year-man. And on top of it all there's irrefutable proof of how instinctive his tricks and mannerisms are--you've heard these vocal grimaces and bursts of prose poetry before, but never in just these heart-stopping places. Definitive: ""He Stopped Loving Her Today.""

Seeking airplay worthy of Bonnie Raitt if not Linda Ronstadt, Don Dixon slows Jones down a little, to less than no avail--the airplay has failed to materialize (or whatever airplay does), and the tempos reveal the reluctance of perfectly hooky modern songwriters to say something and/or the inability of a perfectly attentive modern interpreter to make you ignore it. I know the world is confusing enough to warrant indirection. But when you're going nowhere, do so either fast or in fine style.

She's got her feet on the ground, with a warm simple song about motherhood and a cracked blues about addiction the signposts, but everywhere there are images of flight--as something heroes do, as something she used to do, as something she still can do in her mind. For anyone who never bought her effusions, the music is an advance--grounded as well, from studio-rock four to white-reggae depth charge to the guitars and synths of that blues. Problem is, it rarely flies--which with her more effusive lyrics leaves her not adrift, just nowhere.

Jordan is a Christian comedian who makes jokes about arcane subjects like tithing. I like him.

They harmonize with uncanny consanguinity. Their six-piece production is neotraditionalist (which in Nashville means liberal, right?), totally violinless (fiddleless, even).

FALSE,B,Scatterlings,Juluka,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5115,"
The musical and political strengths and weaknesses of apartheid-fighters Johnny Clegg and Sipho Mchuna are best understood if you think of them as folkies. Beginning as a biracial guitar-and-voice duo committed to Zulu traditionalism, which many apartheid-fighters consider objectively counterrevolutionary, they've become a rock band out of commercial happenstance. Like most folkies, they're often corny--""Simple things are all we have left to trust"" and so forth. But being a folkie in South Africa takes a lot more guts than it does in liberal societies, and that's audible all over this album--as are the melodic resources of the Zulu tradition, which happen to be vocal rather than percussive.

The Stevie Wonder surrogate that vocalist-songwriter Junior Giscombe and keyboardist-producer Bob Carter have synthesized in their London studio is certainly England's most impressive recent export, but it does lack the effervescence and spacy lyricism of the real thing.

At his best, Kahn writes like the gifted local organizer he still is sometimes; his political commitment is bound up in the incidents that precede issues. But his modest folkie renown seems to have cut him off from his sources in much the way that superstardom starves pop genius at the root. With one exception (El Salvador as seen by a farmboy-turned-soldier), the best songs here are the most personal: two for the new love of his life, one for a gay coworker. The political stuff is often generalized, conceived to serve an idea, and while he gets away with it sometimes (an antiharassment song that kicks off from the turn-of-the-century ""It's the Same the Whole World Over""--smart), he does seem to think that ""It's not how large your share is/But how much you can share"" is an inspirational couplet.

What this accomplished display of pop production values proves is that they're big in France because they speak French. With keyb hooks and basslines mixed way up, most of the tracks jump you like the radio.

As he showed those few who heard the sole U.S. release by his Ivory Coast-based Ambassadeurs (on Rounder in 1984), this albino Mali nobleman is one of Africa's great singers. Like his Senegalese neighbor Youssou N'Dour, he's Francophone with Islamic projection, and like anybody this side of Jackie Wilson he falls short of N'Dour's purity and range. But he's old enough to compensate with experience, by which I mean not savvy but feeling and authority. And now, his ambassadorial ambitions largely thwarted, he's making his world pop move solo, recording in Paris with French musicians black and white. Though there's nothing as awkward as the ""Rubberband Man"" N'Dour committed with similar intentions, the arrangements sacrifice a quantum of groove for dramatic effects that wouldn't sound out of place on an Elton John record, and wouldn't wash there either. The way the choral work calls up the musical interludes of a Hollywood safari movie is one of the record's attractions. Needless to say, an attraction ain't all it is.

Warner Bros. has been betting for years that ""Diggy Liggy Lo"" and ""Louisiana Man"" were the mark of a classic songwriter and borderline insanity the mark of a star. But his two '60s hits proved novelty one-shots (or two-shots) and his manic intensity proved impossible to sell. Here they finally let him do a rocking country album that may or may not appeal to the rocking country market, by which I do not mean the outlaw market--I'm talking about a market too small to make him a star. ""It Takes All Day"" is a minor hit, ""Blow Your Horn"" and ""I'm Not Strong Enough"" deserve to follow, and the filler is inoffensive, proving only (outlaws take note) that those who act macho are more appealing if they also act a little nuts.

There are at least three catchy numbers here--the two lead singles plus the consciously silly ""Say It in a Love Song,"" which had better be--and it's not like she remains calm elsewhere. On the contrary, she goes for melismatic pain whenever she sees an opening. But this is formal ploy merely, a diva-by-default's privilege. Her true self comes out in the half-heartedly relentless ""Wait Til You See My Smile,"" a stab at the chin-up franchise once claimed by a young Mariah Carey, and the first thing newcomers will notice even though it's the last track on the album: an inspirational, evasive ""Empire State of Mind"" sequel that establishes Jay-Z's vocal and spiritual superiority so decisively it's hard to imagine her ever attending a Yankees game again.

Since then he has been transformed by astute management into the major attraction he should have been 10 years ago, and I hope he makes two million, but his music is not improving. There's no reason why someone as sweet-voiced as B.B. shouldn't cut his blues with ballads, but his ballad-singing is just plain schmaltzy--the taste that serves him so exquisitely in blues betrays him when he tries to be tasty. This record is good enough, especially the first side. But Live at the Regal is so much better.

FALSE,B,Indianola Mississippi Seeds,B.B. King,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7176,"
I hate to sound like a fuddy-duddy, but the best moment here is unaccompanied--""Nobody Loves Me but My Mother,"" all 1:26 of it, with King singing and playing piano. B.B. King, that is--most of the piano here is by Carole King, who sounds fine, as do Leon Russell and Paul Harris. Even the strings and horns avoid disaster--B.B. goes pop with real dignity. But he's rarely brilliant, and the only songs on this record with a chance of being in his show a year from now are ""Chains and Things"" and Leon Russell's ""Hummingbird,"" hooked on the deathless line ""She's little and she loves me."" I mean, what good does it do to perform that kind of tripe with dignity?

FALSE,B,B.B. King in London,B.B. King,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7177,"
Overlooking Alexis Korner's acoustic boogie, this encounter with Brit second-liners (famed blues devotee Ringo Starr is the big catch) and L.A. session stars is substantial stuff. ""Caldonia"" and ""Ain't Nobody Home"" are more than that. But rock with a steady roll it doesn't. Maybe Klaus Voorman, listed on bass, knows why.

In which B.B. and the Crusaders cut room for a party between sincere schlock and pseudo purism. The King's voice hasn't regained its edge and his guitar is used mostly to decorate Joe Sample's tunes, but this would rate as a mini-comeback if it included another song as good as ""Never Make a Move Too Soon,"" the only one on the album that Sample didn't help write.

FALSE,B,Carole King: Writer,Carole King,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7187,"
I liked these musicians better when they called themselves the City--seemed to protect them against string arrangements, folkie jazz, and other exurban excrescences. Must admit, though, that the first side is a lot more eloquent, confident, and tuneful than the nice little album the City put out in 1968. Now if only the Drifters cover on the second side had some company--the reason I'm listening, after all, is that she also wrote hits for the Chiffons, the Shirelles, Little Eva, . . .
"
FALSE,B,Fantasy,Carole King,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7190,"
The title means she's decided to step outside herself and write songs about imaginary situations, just like some Brill Building hack. A decision which seems to have brightened her music considerably. As for the situations themselves, well, what hath Walter Lippmann wrought? But the odd thing is that in the context of her junkie and housewife soap operas, her quest for ""Directions"" and ""A Quiet Place to Live"" could almost make you ""Believe in Humanity."" I said almost.

FALSE,B,Starless and Bible Black,King Crimson,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7202,"
This is as close as this chronically interesting group has ever come to a good album, or maybe it's as close as Robert Fripp has ever come to dominating this chronically interesting group. As usual, things improve markedly when nobody's singing. The lyrics are relatively sharp, but there must be better ways of proving you're not a wimp than casting invective at a ""health-food faggot."" Unless you are a wimp, that is.

FALSE,B,Discipline,King Crimson,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5142,"
It's amazing how somebody who gabs as much as Robert Fripp gets fucked up by words. Maybe he's afraid to take on a real singer because he knows singers take over bands. So he hires Adrian Belew, who between his David Byrne impressions and his John Wetton impressions and his man-in-the-studio candid-microphone shtick damn near takes over anyway. Musically, not bad--the Heads meet the League of Gentlemen, although I wish the valiant Bill Bruford knew as much about rhythm as John Chernoff. But throw away that thesaurus.

Lenny Wolf's brainchildren share a selling point with the guys they rip so shamelessly: shamelessness. I'm not curious enough to ascertain which Zep songs provide which hook riffs, but that doesn't mean I can't lay back and enjoy a musical force as musical form--a humongous abstraction perfect for flattening the medulla oblongata.

FALSE,B,King Floyd,King Floyd,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11711,"
This is virtually the only good soul music to come from Atlantic in recent memory, which must mean something, probably not good. A standard solid soul LP, nothing ruinous and a couple of good singles to get off on.
"
FALSE,B,Well Done,King Floyd,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7204,"
Floyd's quiet, chocolatey voice--cf. Lee Dorsey, Aaron Neville--is prized by seekers after the New Orleans dispensation, but he's never grooved me without skipping like a cheap bootleg. So I'm pleased to report that side one of his fourth LP, climaxing with the neglected regional hit ""I Feel Like Dynamite,"" provides songs as winsome as the straight-ahead Caribbeanisms (even some reggae) of the New Orleans r&amp;b behind. Location of studio: Jackson, Mississippi.

FALSE,B,A Shade of Red,Redhead Kingpin and the F.B.I.,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5146,"
Proud Jeffersons fan, casual abortion foe, his stupid fresh showing the occasional expiration date, this Englewood eclectic stores his brains somewhere near his ass, where his beats do his thinking for him--first couple of cuts'll have you bopping so happy all you'll care is that he doesn't stammer or sass your mama. Both were mixed and arranged by Teddy Riley, whose salutary effect on Red's mind-body continuum is evinced by his alternating presence and absence throughout.
"
FALSE,B,Misfits,The Kinks,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7215,"
Ray Davies hasn't put so many hummable melodies in one place since Everybody's in Showbiz (just to make sure, he's put a couple of them both places), and the lyrics evince renewed thought and craft. All of which makes his congenital parochialism and ressentiment seem surprisingly fresh and vivid. Dismaying: ""Black Messiah""--Enoch Powell would be proud.
"
FALSE,B,Dressed to Kill,Kiss,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7216,"
I feel schizy about this record. It rocks with a brutal, uncompromising force that's very impressive--sort of a slicked-down, tightened-up, heavied-out MC5--and the songwriting is much improved from albums one and two. But the lyrics recall the liberal fantasy of rock concert as Nuremberg rally, equating sex with victimization in a display of male supremacism that glints with humor only at its cruelest--song titles like ""Room Service"" and ""Ladies in Waiting."" In this context, the band's refusal to bare the faces that lie beneath the clown makeup becomes ominous, which may be just what they intend, though for the worst of reasons. You know damn well that if they didn't have both eyes on maximum commerciality they'd call themselves Blow Job.

FALSE,B,Neither One of Us,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7221,"
If Knight is the golden mean of female soul, here she could use some burnishing. From the hits through the covers to the fillers she turns in a more than creditable job, but only on a slow version of ""For Once in My Life"" do you feel she couldn't go a little deeper. You'd think she was planning to leave her label.
"
FALSE,B,Imagination,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7222,"
Damn right ""Midnight Train to Georgia"" is a great single, but that's no reason to devote an album to the wit and wisdom of Jim Weatherly. Weatherly's stuff does beat out the two Pips showcases, though--a transparently hokey ""I Can See Clearly Now"" and a song about Granny's window designed to recall the one about Daddy's mouth.
"
FALSE,B,Visions,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5153,"
Accurately acclaimed as her finest work in a decade, this is amazingly uniform for an album featuring eight different bassists and eight different drummers recorded in eight different studios in L.A., Nashville, and Vegas. To an extent that's a tribute to Leon Sylvers's consistent vocal and rhythm arrangements. To an extent it's a tribute to the authority this great pop singer still commands when she's in the mood. And to an extent it's attributable to flat material.

FALSE,B,The Best of Gladys Knight & the Pips: The Columbia Years,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5156,"
Five essentially identical Vegas funk grooves on the A, five essentially anonymous pop-soul ballads on the B. You recall all ten as they come on, two or three as you reread the titles. What does it take to jolt this woman out of her own competence?

FALSE,B,Poor Little Critter on the Road,The Knitters,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3686,"
With Dave Alvin and John Doe getting a chance to pick and Exene getting a chance to sing purty, this ad hoc roots excursion is often tuneful and appealing, sometimes much more. I have my silly faves, but the convincer isn't silly at all--""Cryin' but My Tears Are Far Away,"" in which Doe not only writes and sings (and how) a classic country ballad, but creates a paradigm of urban alienation at the same time. Unfortunately, the bad stuff can be revoltingly cute, beatnik romanticism's softfolkie underbelly, as in the Old MacDonald intro to ""Rock Island Line"" or the speeded-up tag to ""Walkin' Cane,"" which seems designed to convince alienated urbans that you can get rock and roll out of this hick stuff.

FALSE,B,The Knowbody Else,The Knowbody Else,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10863,"
A classic white Southern rock band. Despite the terrible group name and the terrible label name (Stax subsidiary) and the terrible cover art, they really make it. Lead singer James Mangrum is a cross between Dr. John and Captain Beefheart, the arrangements are spare and evocative, the songs simple but never banal. Very nice.
"
FALSE,B,Anikana-o,Kongas,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7236,"
Here we have the best tracks by a 1974 version of the Kongas remixed and lengthened according to current disco usages. As any good Africanist would hope, the music depends more on congas and less on traps--the A side comprises some sixteen minutes of multipercussive dance music that moves steadily after a slow start. The B side is marred by a silly Eurorock voice going on about what ever happened to his world. Africanism, that's what.
"
FALSE,B,Konk Jams,Konk,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5943,"
As a white salsa band they were horn players who'd found their niche in the cosmos. Then they discovered sampling, most impressively on the Earth, Wind &amp; Flames rip ""Acid Jam."" So now they're a white funk band con salsa, and tastier for it, too.

FALSE,B,Everything's Kool and the Gang: Greatest Hits and More,Kool and the Gang,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1950,"
If the glitzy, vaguely hip-hop electro-disco ""club remixes"" of such bare-bones funk milestones as ""Jungle Boogie"" and ""Hollywood Swinging"" are a little disorienting, they're far from sacrilegious. Together with the hits (plus the well-earned ""Rags to Riches,"" companion piece to the well-earned ""Money and Power""), they put this undependable band in its place, a step ahead of the Commodores. Maybe two steps.
"
FALSE,B,Computer World,Kraftwerk,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1964,"
I once convinced myself to enjoy this band--if there had to be synthesizer rock, I thought, better it should be candidly dinky. And this is their funniest to date--every time I hear that machine intone ""I program my home computer/Bring myself into the future,"" I want to make a tape for all those zealots who claim a word processor will change my life. But fun plus dinky doesn't make funky no matter who's dancing to what program. Funk has blood in it.

FALSE,B,An Adjustment to Society,Kraut,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5164,"
New York's most likely hardcore boys keep the hooks coming for a whole side of enlightened rant--not twenty yet and they've figured out that past and future are real categories, always a tough lesson for rock-and-rollers. Overdisc, despite a terrific antiwar closer, they settle for blurred distinctions.
"
FALSE,B,Natural Act,Kris & Rita,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7244,"
Before the days of Oscar nominations and Jackie Wilson atrocities, when these married hippies were striving to gain acceptance as a mainstream country duo, they actually went out of their way to be boring--the material on Full Moon was so damn acceptable you almost didn't notice it was there. So I guess Breakaway was ""transitional,"" because this time the outlaw superstar duo work with much sharper songs, including three from T-Bone Burnett and two (good ones) from Billy Swan. Unfortunately, K&amp;R don't go out of their way to be interesting, and when you're as somnambulant as this pair, sharp songs aren't enough.
"
FALSE,B,Music of Bill Evans,Kronos Quartet,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10312,"
This ain't jazz, it's chamber music, and where the same not-quite-swinging strings worked up an agreeable tension on Monk Suite, here the compositional mesh is too neat--Evans damn near wrote chamber music to begin with. On the cute tunes there's an endearing novelty effect, but all the impressionistic watercolors gain is a gravity of tone that will challenge the assumptions of nobody interested enough to listen.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Fela Ransome-Kuti & the Africa 70,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4781,"
Read the fine print: ""Recorded in Lagos Nigaria [sic] and EMI, London 1971-1973."" In other words, in the early days of Afrobeat, while Fela was (a) in the throes of inspiration or (b) getting his shit together. Or, as you'd figure, some combination. Familiar riffs and beats are already in place on these four-minute songs, and harsh rhetoric, too. At times the singing goes for a feral power abandoned later. But the sonority and build and staying power of great Fela are missing, and missed.
"
FALSE,B,Pressure Cookin',Labelle,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7248,"
This certainly is a drastic improvement, although because Nona Hendryx still has trouble writing discernible melodies it demands more concentration than it's worth. What's changed is the arrangements--the backing musicians, especially keyboard honcho Andre Lewis (although each of the others puts a mark on at least one cut), achieve a jazz r&amp;b that gives the voices (all of them) room to groove. Patti LaBelle pulls out all the stops dynamically, but she also puts them back in--there's drama as well as declamation here--and on ""Hollywood"" and ""Let Me See You in the Light"" Hendryx gives her some lines. The covers don't hurt either--whoever had the idea of segueing from Thunderclap Newman to Gil Scott-Heron did justice to this noble group concept, and Stevie Wonder proved himself a true friend.
"
FALSE,B,Winner in You,Patti LaBelle,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5335,"
No previous crossover diva has purveyed such an out-and-out fabrication. Tina's weathered sexpot, Whitney's soulful yuppie--these are credible plays on credible personas. But though Patti is managed by her longtime husband and advised by her longtime son, she nevertheless keynotes her multiplatinum bid with a tribute to the loneliness of the soulful yuppie, written by yet another successfully married couple but inspired I'm sure by one-cut-stand Michael McDonald (cf. Tina meets Bryan, Aretha meets George, and I bet Whitney trades Jermaine in on Phil Collins or somebody next time). Then again, Patti doesn't start out with such surefire goods--her abrasive nasality has always kept her reputation cult. Which is why it's just as well for Patti that Richard Perry overwhelms the eight other producers: beats and tunes kick in till you could care less what organ she's singing through.

Surprise--the fast ones are fun, the slow ones aren't. Fast ones might be even more fun if this weren't a band that praises Toto (the dog, but I think they're funning) in the same stanza with James Brown. Slow ones might be some fun if the singers had the style (skill's not the problem) to convey why they bother.
"
FALSE,B,Shadowland,K.D. Lang,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1901,"
Whether claiming Nashville for torch song, joining Tracy Chapman's New Dignity movement, or embalming country the way title-tunesmith Chris Isaak embalms rockabilly, Lang resembles Patsy Cline (or whomever) less than the Pet Shop Boys--impossible to suss out her relationship to music she presumably loves.
"
FALSE,B,On the Loose,Denise LaSalle,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10812,"
This leads with the proud, ebullient, raunchy ""A Man Size Job,"" which outromps even ""Run and Tell That"" on her debut, but after that things get quite nondescript--enjoyable except for the silly cover of ""Harper Valley P.T.A.,"" but nothing for Aretha to get nervous about. And Aretha could use a good case of nerves.
"
FALSE,B,Here I Am Again,Denise LaSalle,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10813,"
Not many country albums are crafted so carefully--LaSalle does one a year instead of two or three--but the similarities between Memphis and Nashville are striking here. I prefer her musical formula (despite strings from the accursed David Van De Pitte) to Billy Sherrill's, but she's not singer enough to make much of it. Her songs run the gamut from loss to infidelity to less complex sexual situations while Nashville's run the gamut from loss to infidelity to less complex emotional involvements. So what's the difference? It's that when LaSalle invites her lover to let his ""imagination run wild,"" I believe he might think of something I wouldn't.
"
FALSE,B,Under the Influence,Denise LaSalle,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10814,"
In the wake of two bad tries for the big label, this perpetually promising, perpetually frustrating singer-songwriter rebounds a little, flattering Millie Jackson sincerely every step of the way. The bleh ballad is more than overbalanced by ""Feet Don't Fail Me,"" a sorrowful, tellingly specific cheating song. But the self-production never finds a groove. Recommended to stubborn old souls.
"
FALSE,B,Guaranteed,Denise LaSalle and Satisfaction,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5345,"
Leading off with the irritating ""I'm Tripping on You"" (he's also ""a contact high""), side one is more of the utterly ordinary dance music this self-starting singer and songwriter has been wasting herself on for years. But side two puts three of her sexual autonomy specials around the best hook on the record, which is connected to something called ""E.R.A. (Equal Rights Amendment)."" The subtitle's to let you know she's not singing about earned run averages or the Economic Recovery Administration--she's singing about the Amendment, the piece of paper itself, and she knows it spells more than sexual autonomy. Ideal for dance-party fund-raisers.
"
FALSE,B,Baselines,Bill Laswell,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=307,"
One thing's sure--this is shitty background music. That's intentional, of course, but if Laswell's/Material's avant-fusion experiments are to prove useful to avant-pop listeners, they'd better reward attention more brilliantly than they do. Pulse or no pulse (and it can be either), the usual interesting-to-inventive, and even though I prefer Laswell's urban, conflict-ridden taste in noise to the ecological romanticism of the ethnojazz school, I don't hear the street or the subway (or my stereo) any better than before I put this on.
"
FALSE,B,Peter Laughner,Peter Laughner,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5351,"
These club dubs and worktapes aren't for audiophiles, but should convince mere rock-and-rollers that the Cleveland rock critic, a founding and former member of Pere Ubu before he excessed himself to death in 1977, deserves his musical legend. The songwriting is Dylanesque (""Baudelaire"") or better (""Sylvia Plath""), the early-Dylan impression uncanny (""Rag Mama""). His guitar moves aren't so undeniable--when I'm feeling world-historic they sound prophetic, but soon the mood passes and they revert to the untutored one-offs and amateur sketches they were.
"
FALSE,B,Well Down Blue Highway,The Leaving Trains,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5355,"
Side one does honor to the straight (nonhippie/nonhardcore/nonbiz) bohemianism of X, the Gun Club, and Chris D. Cruder and sloppier than X, as you'd guess if not hope, and a lot less pretentious than the other two, with songs that stay with you long enough to make you ponder Falling James's unhistrionic take on impending doom. That's side one. Side two is neopsychedelic drone.

Originals and influentials they obviously are, but too often individual pieces of their unprecedented music aren't necessary. They didn't have time to get really silly here, so this is unusually consistent, but ""Hots on for Nowhere"" is as close as it comes to a commanding cut, and I prefer ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""Rock and Roll"" and ""Dancing Days."" Nu?

FALSE,B,Women's Love Rights,Laura Lee,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7262,"
The title hit actually mentions ""women's liberators and men sympathizers,"" a black-music first, and unlike ""Respect,"" say, it lays out a critical analysis as well as asserting a prerogative. But the underlying if-you-can't-beat-'em passivity of this analysis comes clear in an amazing eight-minute version of ""Since I Fell for You"" (""You made me leave my happy home"" and so forth) that says a lot more about Lee's real power than ""Wedlock Is a Padlock."" It's also worth noting that many of her most militant songs were written by one William Weatherspoon. How about a chorus of ""You Don't Own Me,"" Ms. Lee?
"
FALSE,B,Live in New York City,John Lennon,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5363,"
Just by putting his all into such unsung great songs as ""Well, Well, Well"" and ""It's So Hard,"" the great singer comes a lot closer to justifying this ad hoc document than Jagger did with Ya-Ya's or Daltrey did with Leeds. The alternate ""Instant Karma"" and ""Cold Turkey"" and ""Mother"" are also welcome. But his accidental romance with Elephant's Memory never did him any good musically. And for all his encouragement Yoko wasn't yet a rock-and-roller, so ""Hound Dog"" remains a concept.

He abjures the slick. He honors the hook. He reckons the wages of imperialism. He spells forebears and forbearance correctly in the same sentence. So of course he's an Indie Hope. But his literate lyrics rarely hang together or hit home, and unless you miss Kevin Rowland more than Eileen ever did, his penchant for signifying commitment by vaulting up the scale is an annoying convention at best, an unlistenable tic at worst--namely, yoked to his limited melodic capacity on ""Dead Voices,"" which has Indie Lifer stamped on its copyright notice.

FALSE,B,Iceberg,Deke Leonard,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7271,"
Released a year ago in England by this once and future Man, Leonard's solo debut is as raw as the folk-rock fairytales of ex-Man Malcolm Morley are tame, which is no doubt why UA put out Help Yourself and not Leonard here. Welsh metal, Dave Edmunds influence, with slide and echo and a nice colloquial terseness applied to such traditional Llanellian themes as agro and looking for a woman--but not quite songful enough, or cool enough, to get the hots for.

FALSE,B,"Live at the International, Las Vegas",Jerry Lee Lewis,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7274,"
Unlike The Greatest Live Show on Earth, a rock and roll set, this concentrates on ""the country and western field of music."" Jerry Lee runs through a few hits, calls upon Linda Gail for a couple of numbers, barely notices Tom T. Hall's ""Ballad of Forty Dollars,"" and climaxes with ""Flip, Flop and Fly,"" originated by Joe Turner in the rhythm and blues field of music. Very fast, very arrogant, and I suppose very dispensable. But Jerry Lee throws Jerry Lee away a lot easier than I do.
"
FALSE,B,"The ""Killer"" Rocks On",Jerry Lee Lewis,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7275,"
Is Jerry Lee essaying a rock and roll revival because the country market is drying up for him or because he's never abandoned his dreams of world conquest? Only on ""Don't Be Cruel"" and ""Chantilly Lace"" does he sound triumphant, so it must be the former, which would be the only reason for him to cut this in Nashville anyway. Consequences of cutting in Nashville include a dippy chorus and the most egocentric version of ""Walk a Mile in My Shoes"" since the world began.

Though like most country best-ofs this isolates some strong songs, it also courts the middle-aged crazy market by picking titles old farts will recognize, like his lame-ass ""Who Will Buy the Wine"" and ""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues."" We don't get his loose-as-a-goose ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie Goodbye."" We also don't get his rockin' ""Rita Mae,"" his rockin' ""Don't Let Go,"" his rockin' ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" and I could go on.

Simon Cowell's British Idol possesses an exceptionally delicate version of the sock-it-to-'em karaoke-champ voice Cowell has made the gold standard of '00s pop. The subtle flutter of her finest melismatics could give an open-minded person goose bumps. Her coarser melismatics, however, are the usual showoff BS and probably also a commercial prerequisite, like not having a harelip. And because she doesn't write, this is karaoke where nobody knows the originals. Of course, when OneRepublic provided your lead single and ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is your literary highlight, it's just as well you don't write. ""Forgive Me"" would be a tolerable follow-up. Somehow I doubt Cowell cares.

FALSE,B,Little Feat,Little Feat,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7284,"
Lots of ""tight"" groups are influenced by the Band these days, but these guys could almost pass for them. The sensibility is freakier (""Strawberry Flats"" is a weary state-of-the-counterculture song, like Mother Earth's ""Then I'll Be Moving On""), and there are shades of the country Stones (""Truck Stop Girl"" is a more empathetic ""Dead Flowers"") as well as a convincing Howlin' Wolf imitation. But the dark instrumental interweave and pained vocals are right off Music From Big Pink. And I've always admired that album from a distance.
"
FALSE,B,Feats Don't Fail Me Now,Little Feat,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2079,"
So immersed are they in boogie tradition that they wrote a bunch of touring songs while breaking up. Good ones, of course, but I expect more of the thinking man's bar band than rock and roll doctors, American cities, and the lure of the road. Extra added distraction: a remake of ""Tripe Face Boogie"" designed for Sam Clayton's pulsating congas and Bill Payne's distended organ.
"
FALSE,B,Time Loves a Hero,Little Feat,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7285,"
Okay, so they're not a rock band or even a boogie band anymore--they're a funk band, praising the gods of rhythm for their black bassist and conga player. But neither Ken Gradney nor Sam Clayton could make the grade in P-Funk or the Crusaders or the Meters, and that's not even mentioning Bill Payne's synthesizers, which recall bad Rufus. And they still go through the motions of writing songs, the wordy kind that get in the way of the beat. In the end, though, that's what saves this--""Old Folks Boogie"" beats anything on the last two albums, ""Time Loves a Hero"" tries, and ""Rocket in My Pocket"" is a Lowell George readymade like you didn't think he had in him anymore.

FALSE,B,Vivid,Living Colour,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5387,"
A few songs--the just-minding-my-own-business-sucker ""Funny Vibe,"" the Mick Jagger production/tribute ""Glamour Boys,"" and ""Middle Man"" if it's as unironic as I hope--are smart enough, butwhile it's momentarily exhilarating to hear this all-black band come power-chording out of the box, after a while the fancy arrangements and strained soul remind me of, I don't know, Megadeth. Like any New Hendrix, Vernon Reid is only as good as his last context, and I'm not positive crossover metal is a good idea even in theory.

FALSE,B,14 Shots to the Dome,L.L. Cool J,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2092,"
Proof we didn't need that his talent is as phat as an elefant's phart and his brain is the size of a pea. Only it isn't his brain--it's his ability to comprehend contradiction. Like Michael Ivey, of all people, he flunked his follow-up because he can't figure out how to put success and rap together. Where Ivey (or the Basehead ""character,"" ha ha) takes his dorky confusion out on women, L.L.'s sexism is love-man suave--his ""It's so relaxin'"" after a piece of pussy gets off in the back of his Jeep is a rare moment of grace. Instead he slings the gangsta metaphors and handgun memories in the vain hope that the guys hanging out by the check-cashing place will think he's hard. But from the look of the crotch he's grabbing in several photos, as of now he just ain't.

FALSE,B,Waves,Charles Lloyd,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11434,"
The usual vaguely cosmic jazz enlivened by some sensual percussion and the best Beach Boys chorale since Sunflower. It's called ""TM,"" and I insist it stands for Terry Morgan because I'm afraid it stands for The Maharishi. Unfortunately, Mike Love reprises with a recitation, completing the eternal circle with a resonant zzzzzzzzzz.

FALSE,B,Does 12,Robert Jr. Lockwood,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7293,"
Lovers of urban blues will cherish this record by Robert Johnson's self-designated heir. It even boasts some adventurously progressive saxophone and twelve-string stylings that do no violence to a notoriously intransigent genre. But Lockwood is an undistinguished vocal interpreter, and only one of his originals--the imperturbable ""Selfish Ways""--is worthy of interpretation itself.

FALSE,B,Is This What You Want?,Jackie Lomax,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10842,"
There's something faintly perfunctory about Lomax's intensity, a common failing of British shouters, but this album has some good songs and superb production by George Harrison, plus Richard Starkey on drums.

FALSE,B,Lone Justice,Lone Justice,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5391,"
Although Maria McKee sure does have a big voice for such a young thing, sometimes I get the feeling she's playing grown-up with it--""After the Flood,"" about staying put on the family farm come hell or high water, doesn't exactly reflect the personal experience of someone who met her guitarist in a parking lot in the San Fernando Valley. Not that I doubt her passionate sincerity. Just that I find it generates more credibility when she worries about her man working late or warns him not to insult her in front of her friends.

FALSE,B,10/5/1960,The Long Ryders,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5392,"
What Jason and the Scorchers are to punk these guys are to new wave, with a soul Gram Parsons fans will recognize. But though Sid Griffin has assimilated the right songwriting skills, there's something tentative if not theoretical about the way he puts them to use--like he feels a little unworthy. Which means he probably is a little unworthy.

Divested not only of fifth columnist Arto Lindsay but of all the guitar's vulgar ""rock""-tinged associations, the Lizards get beau ideal Teo Macero to produce a studio album in live drag. They sound like an arty jazz combo who've landed a month at a pretentious cocktail lounge in Minneapolis, or Brussels. Sometimes they gear their originals to what they deem the declasse ambience of the place, other times they say fuck it and lay down the simplified Cecil Taylor dearest to their hearts. They're better when they lower themselves. And they don't make it past Saturday night.

FALSE,B,Extended Niceties,Love of Life Orchestra,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5780,"
Concertmeister Peter Gordon doesn't deploy Arto Lindsay's untuned guitar as wickedly as lizard-leader John Lurie does, but how can you not love the way he punctuates and punctures the girlies crooning ""Don't, don't please don't leave me"" to close things off? It's enough to make you believe Gordon's otherwise unsung rock parody is funny.

FALSE,B,Lyle Lovett and His Large Band,Lyle Lovett,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2184,"
After kicking off with a sharp r&amp;b instrumental, the lapsed grad student dispenses with pretension and boils country down to the basics. Singing: well-schooled. Songcraft: canny, humorous. Concept: women, you can't live with 'em and you can't live without 'em--and it's their fault. Lest anyone mistake his intentions, he also covers ""Stand by Your Man."" Very humorous.

FALSE,B,No-Man's Land,Lene Lovich,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5783,"
Lovich hasn't so much gone Anglodisco as vice versa: she was swooping through postpunk well before the coming of the synthesizers, and she's no less goofy today. Nevertheless, she does sound less goofy, because she's surrounded by swoopers. Which doesn't make her secret privatism any easier to get to.

FALSE,B,I Wanna Be Free,Loretta Lynn,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7303,"
Like any country workhorse, Lynn customarily pads her three or four albums a year with the popular songs of the day. Here the unadorned sexuality of ""Help Me Make It Through the Night"" and the white gospel roots of ""Put Your Hand in the Hand"" prove that for a great natural singer remakes needn't be a waste. But then there's ""Rose Garden."" And ""Me and Bobby McGee.""

FALSE,B,When the Tingle Becomes a Chill,Loretta Lynn,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7306,"
Lola Jean Dillon's title hit is the best song about frigidity, as we once called it, since the Velvet Underground's ""Here She Comes Now,"" and gets Lynn's most listenable side in years off with a bang. Too bad ""Daydreams About Night Things,"" the best song about having the hots for your spouse since ""Behind Closed Doors,"" wasn't chosen to soften the impact of ""You Love You"" and ""All I Want From You (Is Away)""--""Leaning on Your Love,"" which got the nod instead, belongs on side two, which you needn't bother with, since nobody else did.

FALSE,B,Skynyrd's First and . . . Last,Lynyrd Skynyrd,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7311,"
I'm glad to own this album, cut at Muscle Shoals in the pre-MCA days and overdubbed for possible release before the plane crash ended their career. I'm impressed by both the packaging (forty-four photos, many terrific) and John Swenson's notes (extensive, acute), and I like the music fine. But I don't think this is where I'll go to hear Skynyrd. Even if I wanted to disregard the two song-poems by long-departed drummer-vocalist Ricky Medlocke and the less than essential alternate version of ""Things Goin' On,"" I expect more from Skynyrd than good white funk and second-rate message songs. And ""Was I Right or Wrong"" ain't it.

FALSE,B,On Fyre,The Lyres,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3698,"
Just like their fellow neotraditionalists in rockabilly and r&amp;b, these pillars of garage principle set themselves the nearly impossible task of substituting magic for the real thing every track out. As the best of such bands so often do, they get off on a rousing start, in this case by marshalling their two best originals, which they keep going with the help of a couple of covers through all of side one. On side two they slow down a little, and not only isn't the result magical, it's barely rhythmic.

This isn't ""fusion jazz""--it's both more and less, which with ""fusion jazz"" are both good things. In the tradition of Rogers Nelson Dance Music Inc., it not only digs into rhythms jazzbos would dub mechanical, it also makes up new ones--while permitting the drums what sound like snatches of improvisation. Augmented by snatches of eavesdropped dialogue and one faked orgasm, the rhythms impose an ironic distance designed to discourage us from taking the assorted mood-to-avant clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"
FALSE,B,Like a Virgin,Madonna,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2202,"
If a woman wants to sell herself as a sex fantasy I'll take a free ride--as long as the fantasy of it remains out front, so I don't start confusing image with everyday life. But already she's so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical (just like Bowie, right?), she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy.
"
FALSE,B,True Blue,Madonna,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2203,"
Critics flock to her uneven product the way liberal arts magnas flock to investment banking--so desperate are they to connect to a zeitgeist that has nothing to do with them that they decide a little glamour and the right numbers add up to meaningful work, or at least ""fun."" I'm not saying her flair is pleasureless--the generosity she demands in the inexhaustible ""Open Your Heart"" is a two-way street and then some. But she doesn't speak for the ordinary teenaged stiff any more than Reagan speaks for union members (that's called ""selling to,"" folks). And while the antiabortion content of ""Papa Don't Preach"" isn't unequivocal, and wouldn't make the song bad by definition if it were, the ambiguity is a cop-out rather than an open door (or heart), which is bad. In a time of collective self-deception, we don't need another snow job.

FALSE,B,The Real Thing,Taj Mahal,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7317,"
Taj's second straight two-album set is a live one, featuring sidemen from John Simon and John Hall to Kwasi DziDournu, four count-'em four tubas, and ten count-'em ten titles. Lots of fun, but as you might expect, things get very loose, especially when the tubists lay their burdens down.

FALSE,B,Recycling the Blues and Other Related Stuff,Taj Mahal,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7320,"
Heard in the wake of one of Taj's magic shows, the live side seemed an amusing simulation, but no more--the call-and-response goes on too long at 3:40. This might also be said of the 8:40 Spanish guitar (banjo?) solo on side two. The record earns its title, though--the Smithsonian ought to hire this man. Latest instrument: the Pointer Sisters.
"
FALSE,B,Music fuh Ya (Musica para Tu),Taj Mahal,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7323,"
This time the Caribbeanization adds steel drums and a pervasive calypso beat to the country-blues vocal phrasing and jazz-voiced horns, and finally an appropriate smoothness is achieved. The songs aren't much, but ""Sailin' Into Walker's Cay"" cancels out his bass player's tedious ""Curry,"" and if you have to listen easy you might as well relax with this.

FALSE,B,In a Different Climate,Mallard,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2230,"
In case you ever wonder what happened to Captain Beefheart's Magic Band, a few of them joined up here, playing an electric music that recalls country blues (not to mention the Captain himself) in both the guttural density of its sound and the downhome surrealism of its lyrics. Hard to tell it's them only because Beefheart, that lovable eccentric, retains legal rights to their lovable stage names, thus compelling musicians he once induced to remain anonymous to revert to their unknown monikers.

FALSE,B,Prince of Rai,Cheb Mami,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5404,"
'Tis said this tux-clad pretender has a sweeter voice than the goat-king Khaled, but is a green olive sweeter than a lamb chop? He's just higher, more adenoidal, more adolescent. Recorded recently enough to get the groove-bending bass and violin right, this is less monotonous than the competition. Standout cut features a synthesizer echoing the melody line in tribute to ""the style `L'Oranais,' a form that predates `Rai.'"" Nothing like a touch of tradition to add pop novelty to the world-beat norm.

FALSE,B,Be Good to Yourself at Least Once a Day,Man,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7334,"
Authenticated by one Jones (guitarist Micky) and one Williams (drummer Terry), this collective hails from Wales, where human life as we know it began eons ago. No great songs or great solos among these four tracks, but plenty of audible camaraderie--sounds like a cross between the Grateful Dead and the Quicksilver Messenger Service of eons ago, albeit steadier than either, which is too bad in the former case and a good thing in the latter. Upped a notch for historicity.
"
FALSE,B,Coming Out,The Manhattan Transfer,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7343,"
As the memory of the way they demean their material onstage fades, I find I can admire and even enjoy their second album. The scatter-shot eclecticism of the first LP has been aimed--especially on side one, which I much prefer--at the kind of novelty tunes, rock and non-rock, that everyone who listened to pre-Beatles radio loved. The anonymity of the oldies Tim Hauser here unearths--it took me weeks to remember that Roy Hamilton (he of ""Unchained Melody"") came back with ""Don't Let Go,"" I still can't place ""Zindy Lou,"" and even the Motown remake is from Kim Weston--makes a case for the theory that pop music is a delightful but essentially inexpressive industrial product. But the newer songs, several of which are inexpressive only in spite of themselves, destroy the illusion.

FALSE,B,Lady T,Teena Marie,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5407,"
This young white hope isn't breaking ""r&amp;b"" because she sounds so ""black""--she's not a whole heck of a lot funkier than the Doobie Brothers. She's breaking r&amp;b because that's what Motown knows how to do. The hit, ""Behind the Groove,"" is funky enough (the Doobies would give up golf for it), but then again, the more typical ""You're All the Boogie I Need"" is boogie enough. On the fast ones she sounds like Suzi Quatro blessed with a boyfriend smart enough to take it slow. On the slow ones she sounds dumb.
"
FALSE,B,Starchild,Teena Marie,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5410,"
Ballads aren't Teena's problem--self-expression is. Marvin and Aretha are so abundantly endowed they can afford to meander occasionally, but neither would dare stretch ""Out on a Limb"" to 6:38. Better Teena should make like Maya Angelou and design her slow ones for the page. On the other hand, Teena's fast ones need no apology, which she may finally have learned doesn't mean they need no hooks. And when she's riding a hit she can take Marvin and Aretha to the bank.
"
FALSE,B,Survival,Bob Marley & the Wailers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=391,"
It's great in theory that Marley is once again singing about oppression rather than escape, but in practice the album's most powerful political statement is the diagram of the slave ship on the cover and inner sleeve. There's a world of difference between songs of experience like ""No Woman, No Cry"" and songs of generalization like ""So Much Trouble."" And it's a difference that Marley and his musicians are too damn sophisticated to make the most of.
"
FALSE,B,Awake,Julian Marley,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15127,"
It's the curse of audibly inherited talent. Whatever your own limitations, which are often considerable, invidious comparisons shadow your every move as you negotiate between the arrogance of the privileged and the confidence of the born performer--and as your fans try not to wish you were someone else. This album has its moments--the well-worked title cut, a little homily called ""All I Know,"" the ""in a good way"" aside after ""everyone's going crazy"" (on the dancefloor, he wishes). But for the most part it's as heavy-handed as Julian's close-but-no-spliff variation on his fathers timbre and phrasing. Granted, tracks eight and nine do give one hope--until one realizes that the agents of hope are Mr. Cheeks and brother Damian, respectively.

FALSE,B,Bright Day,Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5416,"
He's a confident international entertainer where his dad was a driven third-world artist, which is a loss, but disgruntled accusations that he's betraying his heritage, his confreres, and the great reggae diaspora would disappear if he could take his songs where he wants them to go. Until that if-ever, the synthesis will be more impressive both macro (reggae-rock headed Afrofunk) and micro (this guitar break, that piano comp) than in the middle distance where life is lived and music heard.

FALSE,B,"Newport News, Virginia",Esther Marrow,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11064,"
The opening cut, ""He Don't Appreciate It,"" is such an exceptional example of hard soul (with fantastic arrangement and production by Bob Thiele) that I recommend the whole album to devotees of the genre. (It is also available as a single.) the rest is jazz-oriented, good but uneven: some of the ballads are very weak and there is too much dependence on long codas.
"
FALSE,B,A New Life,The Marshall Tucker Band,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7354,"
If I were from the South, I imagine I'd love this record, because it would be about me, which would be some kind of relief. Since I'm from New York, I have to complain about the almost complacent evenness of the band's aural landscape even as I take off from an occasional rill and dig into their heimische rural mysticism.
"
FALSE,B,Shots from a Cold Nightmare,Moon Martin,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7355,"
Hook fiends will love these ten catchy little numbers, but me, I'm put off by Martin's pop drawl--""tender"" or ""excited,"" he's dispassionate in a way that doesn't suit his musical or lyrical directness. Or maybe it's just that eight songs about treacherous girls are four or five too many.
"
FALSE,B,Let's Get Small,Steve Martin,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11310,"
Martin's style of tastelessness is refreshing--you know he'd do a blue routine or a moron joke if he could come up with one that was funny. But it's not true that he's unsullied by topicality; his definitively post-hip humor is as bound to time and place as Mort Sahl's, less ""pure"" than Bill Cosby's or Jerry Lewis's (not to mention Buster Keaton's). And having listened to this record shortly after making his acquaintance in concert, I find that most of it doesn't wear especially well. Pardon me.

FALSE,B,Alone Together,Dave Mason,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=944,"
I know, the real heavy in Traffic, great songwriter, poor Stevie is lost without him, Delaney &amp; Bonnie on tour, rakka-rakka-rakka. I love ""Feelin' Alright"" myself. But I've never wondered for a second what it means, and only when the music is as elemental as ""Feelin' Alright"" can such questions be overlooked. I mean, songs have words. This is both complex and likable-to-catchy, with a unique light feel that begins with the way Mason doubles on acoustic and electric. But he doesn't have the poetic gift that might justify his withdrawal from ""games of reason"" in the immodestly entitled ""Just a Song."" Songs have words.
"
FALSE,B,"Give, Get, Take and Have",Curtis Mayfield,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7376,"
This meanders more than is conscionable, though Curtis has been drifting through the ozone for so long that you don't notice at first. (For orientation purposes, compare Gladys Knight's ""Mr. Welfare Man."") But I am most pleased to report that the opener, ""In My Arms Again,"" is the first top-notch song he's written for himself since ""Super Fly,"" (somebody bad riffing on guitar--sounds like . . . Curtis Mayfield), and that the three that follow rock and roll.
"
FALSE,B,Love Is the Place,Curtis Mayfield,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5424,"
With help from Dino Fekaris, Mayfield's best album in years includes his first hit in years, but neither has created much stir, which is fair enough--the single is catchy and nothing more, the album honest and nothing more. Except, except. ""Just Ease My Mind,"" a Mayfield-composed ballad, is a gentle plea for succor so purely country I think I've happened upon some disciple of Stoney Edwards or Jesse Winchester every time it catches me unawares. It shouldn't be lost.
"
FALSE,B,McCartney,Paul McCartney,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7378,"
As self-indulgent as Two Virgins or Life With the Lions, yet marketed as pop, this struck me as a real cheat at first. But I find myself won over by its simulated offhandedness. Paul is so charming a melodist (and singer) that even though many of the songs are no more than snatches, fragments, ditties, they get across, like ""Her Majesty"" extended to two minutes. And though Paul's do-it-yourself instrumentals stumble now and then, the only one that winds up on its fundament is the percussion-based ""Kreen-Akrore."" Maybe Linda should take up the drums. She wouldn't be starting from any further back than hubby.
"
FALSE,B,Tug of War,Paul McCartney,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5428,"
Most rock-and-rollers look like simps or cynics by the time they hit thirty-five. Others retain the irrepressible exuberance of a Stevie Wonder, or grasp it again in magic moments the way Carl Perkins does on this album's most affecting cut. A few rare ones age gracefully into fresh-eyed wisdom, like Neil Young and John Lennon. But no matter how serious and sensible he gets, McCartney's perpetual boyishness conveys the perpetual callowness of a musical Troy Donahue. I don't think this is intentional--in his personal life he seems at least as adult as anyone I've named, and he's put his hard-earned craft to mature use on this LP. But it might almost be dumb love songs.
"
FALSE,B,Genuine Cowhide,Delbert McClinton,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7384,"
Texas partisans tout this whoopersnapper as God's own leather-lunged, bicentennial, rockabilly truth, but I can't hear it. He's not ravaged enough; his crazy enthusiasm sounds too professional, too glib; there are none of those spaced-out moments that lend such vulnerability, and credibility, to a Billy Swan. Does this mean I'm complaining that Delbert sings too good? Could be.
"
FALSE,B,Keeper of the Flame,Delbert McClinton,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7385,"
McClinton's cult sentimentalizes bar music--having established that a saloon is as fruitful a nexus for music as a studio, they go on to claim that it's better (""more authentic""). But despite his superior sense of rhythm, Delbert's basically a male Texas Linda Ronstadt--a strong-voiced, versatile performer who doesn't come across on record as an especially interesting person. This not only puts him at the mercy of songwriters and arrangements but limits his taste in both. Album number five, his second for Johnny Sandlin and Capricorn, is probably his best since number one--funkier but less directly dependent on r&amp;b, longer on originals than his last two for ABC, and opening with great readings from Chuck Berry and Randall Bramblett. In short, as enjoyable and forgettable as a Friday night out.
"
FALSE,B,Live at the 1983 Vermont Midsummer Festival,Dick McCormack,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5432,"
His most recent offering doesn't show off this Vermonter's durable songwriting (and collecting) like 1981's acerbically folkloric ""Who Ever Said It Would Be Easy?"" disc--something in a live crowd must bring out the easy wisdom in him. But he almost compensates with jokes, one of which is a drawn-out tale of Jack &amp; Allen &amp; Neil &amp; Clams that's irresistible the first three or four times through and another of which will give you an idea of his style of state chauvinism: ""How many Vermonters does it take to screw in a lightbulb? It takes five--one to screw it in and four to complain how much better the old one was.""
"
FALSE,B,High on the Blues,Jimmy McCracklin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7386,"
Some think McCracklin's faintly plosive moan is distinctive. I think it's a type--ideal for outposts of deep soul, but only serviceable (or a little more) as pure instrument. And you know what? The deep soul drumming of coproducer Al Jackson almost puts it across.
"
FALSE,B,Rock Your Baby,George McCrae,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7387,"
The folks in Miami liked the single so much they extended it through an entire album--literally for eight minutes, then figuratively over long stretches of closely related rhythm track, with McCrae's serviceable but emotionally limited falsetto on top. Funny thing is, the single is so durable they almost got away with it.
"
FALSE,B,Rockin' Chair,Gwen McCrae,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7388,"
I was relieved to be left tepid by this LP's original release, since it was getting embarrassing to wax warm over Miami every time out. But the newly added title hit, almost as irresistibly Memphis-cum-disco-with-a-hook as hubby's ""Rock Your Baby,"" transforms it into more warm wax, tuff enuff to make you wonder what ever happened to soul music.

FALSE,B,Just Can't Sit Down Music,Mel McDaniel,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8241,"
With his best material--not commercially, but critically, a concept that doesn't cut much vinyl down in Nashville--slotted three and four on each side, McDaniel remains a notably decent artist caught between his druthers and his a&amp;r man. So be glad the album's gem, ""Stand on It"" (composer credit: ""B. Springsteen""), did eventually make some noise as a single--albeit not enough to qualify for the best-of that followed it into the racks.
"
FALSE,B,Mel McDaniel With Oklahoma Wind,Mel McDaniel With Oklahoma Wind,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5433,"
A rugged old pro who's hewed a path between outlaw grease and countrypolitan silicone, McDaniel here enters a Nashville studio with his road band, a mild act of defiance that produces an album sensible folks can listen to clean through without Bromo-Seltzer--though the overly tough-minded may want to keep a Tum or two at hand.

FALSE,B,Have I Got a Deal for You,Reba McEntire,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5434,"
Finally her own award-winning, best-selling woman, she assumes coproducer status and sheds Harold Shedd, whom some would say got her this far. And indeed, with a little help from Jimmy Bowen she refines the formula-no backup choruses, no newfangled keyboards, no bedroom lyrics. She's a lot more her own woman than hot-to-trot centerfold candidates like Janie Fricke. But though occasionally her music defeats country's sex-role divisions--the self-composed I-never-actually-cheated song ""Only in My Mind"" is so proud and virtuous and deeply regretful it could give a fella bad dreams--she suggests that female country singers are going to have trouble rebelling neotraditionally. Especially with men providing the material.

FALSE,B,Whoever's in New England,Reba McEntire,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5435,"
Winning though her directness may be, McEntire is neither as clear as George Strait nor as lavish as John Anderson. In fact, the basics she gets back to recall Rosanne Cash more than anyone else, and no matter how she tries, she just can't rock out (or sing) like Nashville's crossover queen. Most convincing are the jauntily defiant cheating-on song ""Little Rock,"" where she plays a rich man's wife, and the dolefully forgiving cheated-on song ""Whoever's in New England,"" where she plays a young executive's wife. Elsewhere she's mostly just direct.
"
FALSE,B,The Spy,Bat McGrath,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7395,"
Although he's a nice singer, McGrath is bound in by the mildly jazzy conventions of contemporary folk music. But his songs still say more about how it is for all those formerly young guys with beards who chose to live in the country back around 1970 than all the paeans to homemade bread coming out of Vermont, Colorado, and Marin.

FALSE,B,Roger McGuinn,Roger McGuinn,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7397,"
From L.A. session men to Charles Lloyd eight-miles-high to Bruce Johnston ooh-ooh to Clark, Clarke, Crosby, Hillman &amp; McGuinn, Roger's solo debut sounds more coherent than any Byrds album since Sweetheart of the Rodeo, which must prove he's an auteur. Jacques Levy plays the Gram Parsons catalyst, but since Levy only writes lyrics the chemistry is a good deal less powerful. And it does worry me that Levy worked on all the good cuts: the ones about highjacking, love in Vietnam and ""my new woman,"" and especially ""I""m So Restless,"" the best state-of-the-music song since ""All the Young Dudes.""
"
FALSE,B,Thunderbyrd,Roger McGuinn,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7401,"
I hate the name-dropping title, but this is McGuinn's best since his solo debut, including a tongue-in-cheek version of Dylan's mystical-romantic ""Golden Loom,"" a psychedelic reminiscence, and good-to-great covers from George Jones, Tom Petty, and--the conceptual triumph--Peter Frampton.
"
FALSE,B,McGuinness Flint,McGuinness Flint,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7403,"
Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle's consistently tuneful tributes to America and other romances derive most of their character from the jolly-English quirkishness of the band's folk-rock. Only ""International,"" one of their two attempts at a weightier lyric, is anywhere near as irresistible as ""When I'm Dead and Gone,"" and ""Brother Psyche"" indicates why they usually play it safe.
"
FALSE,B,Honky Tonk Angel,Ellen McIlwaine,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7404,"
McIlwaine falls into all the overambitious traps--she dramatizes, she vaunts her range, she improvises when she should just sing--and yet she gets away with it, because enough of her grand attempts work. It's good to hear a woman play bottleneck guitar (in an appropriate context, too) and the two times she goes up an octave on ""God"" in ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"" almost justify a whole side.

FALSE,B,Troublemaker,Ian McLagan,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7405,"
In which the fifth Face, his mates dispersed to the Stones, the Who, Meher Baba, and Hollywood, makes a Faces album as good 'n' raucous as, oh, Long Player. He's more convincing taking a pot shot at the Hollywood Face than movin' out (on guess what kind of person) or seducing a virgin (that's the Hollywood Face's specialty). But if men will be boys, this is how they should go about it.

FALSE,B,Waltz Darling,Malcolm McLaren and the Bootzilla Orchestra,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5801,"
""Buffalo Girls"" notwithstanding, this is the first time since Bow Wow Wow that the old reprobate has shown pop ambition--Bootsy and Jeff Beck charge serious money to help you with your culture lessons, and money McLaren normally keeps to himself. Linking house, funk, and rai to the historic sexual breakthrough of the Strauss waltz, McLaren romanticizes the rich just like he's always romanticized the poor. But the concept is a cover for the only message he's ever cared about--teen sexuality as liberation, especially for old reprobates. ""Algernon's Simply Awfully Good at Algebra"" is as good as its title, maybe better. The rest is soft-core kiddie porn.

FALSE,B,My Goal's Beyond,Mahavishnu John McLaughlin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7406,"
What a mind-fuck! Just when I have him pegged as the Duane Eddy of the Aquarian Age he goes acoustic on me! ""Peace One,"" ""Peace Two,"" yeah yeah yeah--it's easy when you don't plug in. Conjuring peace out of chaos the way Devotion does is the real trick. And while like most white people I've failed to develop my taste in sitar music. I don't like the looks of this Mahalakshmi on the cover--she's white too, and I'll bet she got on the record the same way Sri Chinmoy got to write the notes. Sitar sound effects from George Harrison are one thing--that's just rock and roll. John's goal is supposed to be beyond.
"
FALSE,B,Lyte as a Rock,MC Lyte,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5440,"
Unlike so many of her femme-metal counterparts, she knows how to talk tough without yielding to the stupid temptations of macho. But as nobody's girl, she spreads 10 tracks among four producer-DJs, who chill too close to the max as she attempts to carry the music with her bare rap. Even their weirdest hooks are understated by half, and Lyte's quotes (not samples) from ""I'm in the Mood for Love,"" ""Big Girls Don't Cry,"" ""I Am Woman,"" and ""Hit the Road Jack"" aren't loud enough to compensate. Minimal isn't the only way she can go, as Sinead O'Connor fans know. Are they in for an unpleasant surprise.
"
FALSE,B,Meat Puppets,Meat Puppets,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5444,"
These Phoenix boys not only realize L.A. punk's no-wave proclivities in brief, doomy noise songs that sound like DNA meeting the Marx Brothers, they cover ""Tumblin' Tumbleweeds."" And include a dancy lyric sheet featuring lines like ""You are like children in the marketplace/Shouting to your playmates"" and ""We get stones like it's going out of style."" None of which they go so far as to pronounce over or under the hardcore roar.
"
FALSE,B,Message from the Meditations,The Meditations,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7411,"
A new group has to score singles often in Jamaica before getting an album, and with three singers--including two distinctive high tenors--sharing writing and lead vocals, this is a nice one. Just wish it featured more island chauvinism--if I'm not mistaken, ""Running From Jamaica"" gets on those who emigrate to Canada, Britain, the States, and Africa--and less of the male kind.
"
FALSE,B,The Glitterhouse,Medium Medium,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5447,"
""Hungry So Angry"" is so much their greatest moment--the drop-dead riff that's their entree to the Funk Club--I'm tempted to recommend the EP, which offers two versions of the thing. But in the context ""Hungry So Angry"" sets up, the more abstract music they prefer comes across not only raw and spatial but also danceable, and you hardly notice their arty vocal dementia. Which isn't to say you shouldn't go for the EP.
"
FALSE,B,The Mekons,The Mekons,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5449,"
Must be a confusing time in the old country, what with Eurodisco coming back postpunk and the no-wave imperative advancing on no future. Where the Gang of Four respond by constructing a herky-jerk funk from their own inexpertise, their Leeds comrades--who were on that one last year already--yoke an amateur anarchism less obstreperous than Wire's or the Fall's to vaguely traditional songs almost domestic in their attention to modest detail. They also rewrite ""Lipstick on Your Collar"" I think it is. You figure it out.
"
FALSE,B,Uh-Huh,John Cougar Mellencamp,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5454,"
The changed billing indicates John's eagerness to talk straight after years of filtering himself through an inconclusive image, and I wish every AOR hero put his triple platinum to such honest use. Only thing is, the depth of John's populist intentions far outstrips the depth of his populist perceptions--he was just as interesting telling little white lies.
"
FALSE,B,I Miss You,Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7417,"
For most of the eight-and-a-half minutes of the title cut, one Blue Note attempts a calm rapprochement with his estranged wife over the telephone while the others shout, moan, and sob his unspoken feelings--summed up by the title, which must repeat a hundred times. But not even their top-forty breakthrough, ""If You Don't Know Me by Now,"" matches up. Gamble, Huff &amp; Co. show off their skill at instrumental deployment and Melvin provides gorgeous vocal arrangements, but too often it all adds up to noble banalities sententiously expressed. And sometimes the banalities aren't so noble.
"
FALSE,B,Cargo,Men at Work,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5457,"
A touch dour, two touches bemused, and probably way too passive, they're so smashingly unambitious that they're forgettable when they don't strike just the right note. But I've always considered democracy more radical than misanthropy. And I appreciate their sniping at the military-industrial establishment.
"
FALSE,B,Cabbage Alley,The Meters,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7425,"
Just what do these people want? They're still making up titles like ""Gettin' Funkier All the Time,"" even singing one called ""Do the Dirt."" But they're also stretching out a catchy little number called ""Stay Away"" with what annotator Barry Hansen refers to gingerly as ""some most unusual electronic adventures"" and putting voice to Neil Young's ""Birds"" and their own ""Lonesome and Unwanted People."" And what can it mean that the catchiest little number of all has no words and two titles--""You've Got to Change (You've Got to Reform)""?
"
FALSE,B,Fire on the Bayou,The Meters,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3721,"
Thanks to new conga player Cyril Neville, the singing has gotten better, but no matter how much I love ""They All Ask'd for You,"" I'm not sure that's good. Distracts us from the drummer. And maybe it distracts the drummer, too.
"
FALSE,B,You Ain't Rollin Your Roll Rite,Augie Meyers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7430,"
Doug Sahm's faithful organist has a rather shallow voice, but he knows good material and occasionally writes some--""Sugar Blu"" is the way Doug ought to be opening his sets these days, and the title song sounds like advice to rock and rollers who get lost on their way to legendhood. Straightforward Tex-Mex like they don't hardly make no more.
"
FALSE,B,My Main Squeeze,Augie Meyers,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5462,"
History having advanced backwards, the eternal Tex-Mex sideman picks up an accordion. Ronda's on his Honda, and if Velma from Selma's dad doesn't turn him into enchiladas, all will be well.
"
FALSE,B,Primitive Love,Miami Sound Machine,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5463,"
CBS's preemptive strike at MCA's TV-soundtrack capability casts Gloria Estefan, in real life the daughter of a Batista bodyguard, and her hub Emilio, ""Percussion, Manager,"" as minstrels to Viceland's cocaine trade in crossover mode. Real criminals like their music tougher (also live-er), but before you tsk-tsk the perfidy of cops you should heed your body and note that these prefab grooves move--not least the one called ""Mucho Money.""
"
FALSE,B,Ice on Fire,Mighty Diamonds,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7437,"
Just as an assassination attempt doesn't commit Bob Marley to propaganda, so the best reggae album of 1976 doesn't commit the Mighty Diamonds to the music of Jamaica. Here they bid to become just another black harmony group, yoking Allen Toussaint's production to the Kingston beat and covering ""Tracks of My Tears"" (well). We could use another black harmony group, but unfortunately. Toussaint isn't noted for his work with groups, and like most harmony-group albums (not to mention reggae albums) this sounds samey even as it switches unpredictably from Toussaint songs to Mighty Diamonds originals.
"
FALSE,B,Deeper Roots (Back to the Channel),Mighty Diamonds,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7438,"
Most of these songs confidently cross jingle and chant, and Donald Shaw sings in his chains like a true son of Smokey. But never once do the riddims become anthemic. For advanced reggae students only.
"
FALSE,B,The Roots Is There,Mighty Diamonds,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5468,"
The amazing thing about reggae of a certain quality--in which an affecting singer like Donald Shaw joins ace session players--is that no matter how sedulously it restates platitudes about roots and girls and Jah, its small graces eventually get its equally sedulous melodies across. But why should anyone who doesn't credit the platitudes give them that long?
"
FALSE,B,The Rock,Frankie Miller,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1287,"
If like me you have a taste for English soul singers who have taste in American soul exemplars, you will be pleased to learn that Henry McCulloch does a hell of a Steve Cropper imitation. But Miller is no Joe Cocker (not to mention Toots Hibbert) (not to mention . . . ) and he was better off writing fewer songs.
"
FALSE,B,Number 5,Steve Miller,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7441,"
The songs about going to the country, going to Mexico, and eating chili are more substantial than those about Vietnam, Jackson-Kent, and the military-industrial complex. Fortunately, all three of the latter are supposed to bring the album to a rousing (zzzzz) climax, which leaves side one free to bring you back humming.
"
FALSE,B,Your Saving Grace,The Steve Miller Band,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11066,"
The usual sweet-hard rock, pleasant and soulful enough.
"
FALSE,B,Circle of Love,The Steve Miller Band,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5471,"
You whippersnappers want catchy pop tunes, this high-tech cornball's got 'em with blues changes--four nifties on side one. You want hypnotic electro-groove, he's got that with blues changes too--eighteen minutes of it, complete with muddled attack on the military-industrial establishment. Both sides offer sound effects at no additional charge, and Steve would like everyone to know that he's been doing this shit since 1968.
"
FALSE,B,Abracadabra,The Steve Miller Band,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5472,"
With longtime bandbuddy Gary Mallaber making like Jeff Barry, Miller fulfills his hippie destiny and turns into the Archies, or really the Monkees, since he did write the title hit himself, and it will probably stand as the biggest pop tune of 1982, by which I definitely don't mean the most quintessential, because this one is blissfully catchy and blissfully simple and blissfully schlocky and blissfully tricky, like the rest of the album only more so.
"
FALSE,B,Mink DeVille,Mink DeVille,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7447,"
Those who believe ""underground"" rock means a return to basics and nothing more will cheer this sleek, friendly white r&amp;b record, because they'll understand it. Those who insist on learning something new about the basics will continue to prefer the Ramones and Blondie, or Springsteen and J. Geils.
"
FALSE,B,Black Roots,Sugar Minott,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7449,"
This is Jamaica pop, by which I mean modestly tuneful Rasta talk mellifluously sung. Pleasant, but nothing to base a canon on--only ""Oppressors Oppression"" (makes a wise man mad) and ""Two Time Loser"" (in love careless love) will do more than make you hum along.
"
FALSE,B,Inna Reggae Dance Hall,Sugar Minott,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5478,"
A mild-mannered pro who ""Nah Follow Nuh Fashion"" because he never lets it get ahead of him trades in the Roots Radics on a computer-compatible rhythm machine, upping the tempo slightly and shifting his croon toward chant. Product, sure, but useful product, which even in Jamaica is an achievement these days.
"
FALSE,B,The Punch Line,Minutemen,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5480,"
They're politniks who love punk, with a name that mocks hardcore's rightwing rep and their own aesthetic--these eighteen ""songs"" average under fifty seconds apiece. The lyrics don't rhyme or even scan, less poems than the jottings of young men given to cultural bullshit. ""History Lesson""--""hundred thousand years ago homosapiens stood erect mind empty fresh created love and hate created god and antigod human slaughtered human for power""--gets the flavor: not Fredric Jameson, but better-informed than the skinheads they play for. And where last year's seven-inch Paranoid Time could pass for speed-rock, the funky dissonance here has no parallel in the genre or anywhere else: not Ornette Coleman, but better-informed than the Circle Jerks they play with.

FALSE,B,City of Angels,The Miracles,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3728,"
Tom Smucker, explaining why this was included in his annual top ten: ""Motown moves to L.A. and likes what it finds. It's very important that in an era when people don't like cities some people can still find them romantic. And that L.A. is the city. And that Motown are the people."" This is sweet and true, but it ignores the point, which is that this record is a riot. In fact, its achievement is so complete, so true to itself, that the lurking possibility of a put-on can't be dismissed. Space makes it impossible to reprint Inspirational Verse (Q: If the first line is ""Homosexuality"" and the rhyming word is ""society,"" what's the third line? A: ""Well I guess they need more variety""), but print doesn't do it justice anyway. You have to hear the intonations, the falsettos, the backups, the orchestration, some of which can be credited to producer Freddie Perren. All this plus: the first soul song about an underground newspaper.

FALSE,B,The Horrible Truth About Burma,Mission of Burma,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5489,"
One of the two most impressive tracks on this live all-new-material farewell from the seminal Boston indie band is a Stooges cover. The other is an Ubu cover. The rest--eight songs--is entirely original. I'm sure this isn't the horrible truth their label has in mind, but rock historians should jot it down somewhere.
"
FALSE,B,Mission of Burma,Mission of Burma,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5490,"
More even than most postpunk they were also prenoise, harbingers of a rock and roll (or rock) far more traditional than no wave both formally and sonically except that it eschewed (or failed to achieve) melody (or tune). Not indefensible, but less sonically compelling than the defense would have you believe--or so it seems from my generational vantage. Comprising all of Signals, Calls and Marches and Vs. plus the great ""Academy Fight Song"" and lesser arcana, this compilation boasts a new world-record CD length of 80 minutes, which under the sonic-melodic circumstances isn't something to boast about--it goes on for fucking ever. Adepts of the select button need own nothing else. Everybody else should go for what they know.
"
FALSE,B,The Hissing of Summer Lawns,Joni Mitchell,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1844,"
Mitchell's transition from great songwriter to not-bad poet is meeting resistance from her talent and good sense, but I guess you can't fight ""progress."" Not that she's abandoned music--the supple accompaniment here is the most ambitious of her career. But if she wants jazz she could do better than Tom Scott's El Lay coolcats, and the sad truth is that only on a couple of cuts--""The Jungle Line"" and ""Don't Interrupt the Sorrow""--do these skillful sound effects strengthen the lyrics. The result is that Mitchell's words must stand pretty much on their own, and while she can be rewarding to read--""The Boho Dance"" is a lot sharper than most I'm-proud-to-be-a-star songs--she's basically a West Coast Erica Jong. If that sounds peachy to you, enjoy.
"
FALSE,B,Wild Things Run Fast,Joni Mitchell,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1846,"
This is good Joni, for the first time since the mid-'70s, and I suspect it comes too late, because good Joni simply means old Joni, and old Joni is better. I mean, if she'd put ""Solid Love"" at the very end I still wouldn't believe her, but at least I'd think she'd learned something. Instead she proves her maturity with a climactic hymn to St. Paul's kind of love which is much the worst of the three covers--because to be honest the Al Hibbler and Elvis Presley songs are what kept me listening.
"
FALSE,B,Out of Line,Mofungo,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5493,"
Where hardcore kids rail against empty leisure and media images, these working bohemians ground an analysis in the dismal daily grind. Their politics more or less match thick, uningratiating music that is dissonant but not quite amelodic, industrial but not at all mechanical. The match isn't exact because their lyrics are sometimes so simplistic they deserve a single dumb folkie guitar, while the music gets thin in a more unavoidable way, reflecting their blocked access to the means of production. And though I doubt anything would render their ""We're gonna change the world"" literal, my analysis is that a few extra tunes wouldn't hurt.
"
FALSE,B,The Moments Greatest Hits,The Moments,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7456,"
""Love on a Two Way Street"" is this classic falsetto group's only pop breakthrough because it's their only pop tune--Sylvia Robinson gets lots of mileage out of Harry Ray's tenor, but she's not Thom Bell or Eugene Record. For that matter, Ray isn't Russell Thompkins or Eddie kendricks--I love the proto-disco moans on ""Sexy Mama"" and the overarching agony of ""I Do,"" but for the most part he projects a romanticism so transparent that its artificiality shows through. A one-disc selection might work, but two means twenty certified r&amp;b hits that never venture five miles over the speed limit.
"
FALSE,B,Two Sides of the Moon,Keith Moon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7458,"
It's hard to imagine the auteur of this alternately vulgar, silly, and tender travesty/tour de force as anyone but Keith Moon; his madness translates not only to film (Stardust, Tommy) but even to the supersolo studio jobs that this parodies so deliciously. I presume they thought it was funny to mix the backup singers (Nilsson, Nelson, Flo &amp; Eddie) up in front of the guy with his name on the cover. And it was.
"
FALSE,B,Leave the Light On,Lorrie Morgan,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6259,"
With Reba McEntire coming on perkier than Donna Fargo and various young pretenders folkies in disguise, the pseudostrings of this Tammy Wynette-styled throwback are traditional enough to suit me. She'll stand by her man, but not as his love slave, and if ""Out of Your Shoes"" would betray a sisterly premise for a roll in the hay, the unprecedented ""He Talks to Me,"" which climaxes with afterwords, is compensation.
"
FALSE,B,A Period of Transition,Van Morrison,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4097,"
""It Fills You Up"" and ""Heavy Connection"" work on chant power alone, but even they go on a little too long, and in general this is an unexciting record--but not definitively. It's full of the surprising touches--the (borrowed) instrumental intros to the blues that opens side one and the jump tune that opens side two, a throw-in couplet about Amsterdam that might as well have Van's fingerprints on it, and even the can't-always-get-what-you-need chorus on ""Eternal Kansas City""--that signify talent putting out. I don't know; maybe that's depressing proof that this isn't just a warmup. But after three years, let's say it is.

Where you file this de facto best-of from Van's slackest and most spiritual period depends on whether you mourn Astral Weeks or Moondance. I'm putting it in the reference library.
"
FALSE,B,Viva Hate,Morrissey,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5500,"
From my pinnacle of disinterest I can attest that this solo move is neither here nor there. Vini Reilly doesn't have a unique sound like Johnny Marr, and autonomy does encourage the camp grandiosity of a guy who tries to make ""I love you more than life"" live: though he may think it's funny for ""Late Night, Maudlin Street"" to go on for 7:40, in fact it's as boring as you'd expect despite the great line about his revolting nakedness. But the Smiths rarely if ever came up with a hook as must-hear as ""Everyday Is Like Sunday""'s and in general the monotony factor has decreased. The artiste is no longer a kid, and he likes it that way. Essential for acolytes, educational for the rest of us, just like always.
"
FALSE,B,The Best of the Morwells,The Morwells,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5502,"
These half-legendary reggae veterans deserve a U.S. compilation, but not every hitmaker on an island of two million is guaranteed to lead us into Zion. Bingy Bunny moans guilelessly, a laid-back Winston Rodney, while Flabba Holt and Style Scott keep the riddims so close to earth you have to figure they don't command any chancier options.
"
FALSE,B,Pave the Way,Pablo Moses,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5503,"
It's the same for Sly &amp; Robbie as for Stax-Volt, Gamble &amp; Huff, or for that matter Richard Perry--if a great studio style is going to break out of its formula and zap the listener, the record had better offer identification, inspiration, or hooks. But me, I'm no Rasta, or any other kind of theist or cultural nationalist; are you? And the gain in vocal competence strikes me as a dangerous thing--because Moses always ""projects"" now, he deprives his basic singsong of the nursery-rhyme lucidity that makes his best work so winning.
"
FALSE,B,Tension,Pablo Moses,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2657,"
Moses's singsong melodies have always been simplistic even by reggae standards, but on these cautionary ditties neither lyrics nor groove manage the sly, subtle grace of the best of them. Catchy, yes, and righteous too, but as annoying at times as a Sugar Crisps commercial.

Punks have never bought his leather jacket and indie connections because Lemmy Kilmister's grizzled-biker-born-to-rock is metal without the heavy--no preening solos or blow-dried bullshit. I recommend the bit where he promises to get fast and loose with his latest receptacle as soon as he finishes the song about it (not her, of course not), and note that his writing is more one-note than need be, wit and all--fucking for the hell of it can drive anybody into a rage, and tuneless fucking for the hell of it is really pointless. Anthem: ""(We Are) The Road Crew.""

After a debut album that pitted imaginative borrowing against imitative self-expression, Mad Shadows and Wild Life descended thrashing and caterwauling into the depths of rock and roll psychodrama--what could one expect of ""improvisations"" based on such faceless ""originals""? So this is a heartening reverse--not only do they unearth Dion's suppressed farewell to junkiedom, ""Your Own Back Yard,"" and a good old Youngbloods number, but they provide originals that can stand behind them.

""Roll Away the Stone"" and maybe ""Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll"" are classics in their neoclassical mode, which is also to say that they're nothing new, and the marginal stuff is quite undifferentiated. I suspect that Ian Hunter's ego, which he deserves, is crowding out the others. And I know for sure that Ariel Bender flashes more ego than Mick Ralphs ever did, and that he deserves none of it.

FALSE,B,The Best of the Move,The Move,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3731,"
I could trot out the complaint that this double-LP would make a good single, but why bother? Comprising the band's 1967 U.K. debut LP and a lot of uncollected forty-fives, with two sets of notes and detailed discographical data, this is a labor of love that lists at only a buck over the one-record price. Anyway, they wouldn't pick the same cuts I would: my fave is ""Wave Your Flag and Stop the Train,"" which they regard as a Monkees imitation--not a very exact one, I'd say, but close enough to the pop at which they supposedly excelled. I love rock and roll--I just want it to be better. Bands like the Move feel hemmed in by rock and roll--they want it to be different, or more. When they succeed, as the Move finally did, it's often better too. But usually it's less.

How deeply these clever funk lifts and come-hither ululations penetrate your mind-body continuum depends on how deeply you're into big-league fucking, which for these folks seems to involve a confusion between candy and fruit.

Because Garrett's amiable baritone and astringent guitar tend toward blues, this is more coherent Muldaur than either of his Warner solos. And I assume a limited budget curbed some of his sillier experimental fancies, which couldn't have hurt. But his fondness for genteel schlock--tunes by Chopin and Tchaikovsky, a rancid chestnut called ""Beautiful Isle of Somewhere""--still grates.

On side one, the nice tunes from the predictable variety of traditional and contemporary sources are too unfocused to be more than pleasant, but the flip is a modest postfolkie treat. ""Me and My Chauffeur Blues"" shows off Maria's sexiest moods--coy, melancholy, swoony, demanding, and at the end she and her chauffeur come together--while ""Death Letter Blues"" shows off Geoff's most haunted blues voice. In between he camps up ""Brazil,"" she strolls through ""Georgia on My Mind,"" and Jim Kweskin asks Mel Lyman for further instructions.

One accidental if inevitable hit reveals this English jug band as the best novelty group since the Coasters, though the Royal Guardsmen and the Chipmunks aren't what I'd call heavy competition. Great hostling noises, an echo-chamber parody that could make Stan Freberg turn to commercials, and a fair share of dirty talk. But just as Alvin's falsetto used to wear thin after a while, so does Mungo's drawl--and kazoo.

Long after vanishing in the States they were making like the next Creedence over there, releasing six French singles in 1971 alone and cracking top ten in England three more times. Their mood quickly shifted from old- to good-timey, always vaguely entertaining and sometimes on target, as in the affectionate but critical getting-old song ""You Better Leave That Whiskey Alone."" But leader Ray Dorset never showed the kind of acuity as a singer or writer that turns bands into Creedences over here.

The mistake is Paul Rothschild's production, too tasty and anonymous to support the innocence that made Murphy's basically tinny voice and underachieved rock and roll convincing. Deprived of the benefit of the doubt, Murphy's awkward literaryness starts to stick out. You wonder whether his lost generation was really shaped with a ""technicolor carving knife."" You wonder just how much he knows about Eva Braun. You wonder why the two strongest cuts on the record--the love songs on side one--are the ones you notice last. And in the end you hope the next record makes it.

The strongest of her five albums offers ten realistic, deeply felt songs, including ""You Made My Life a Song,"" the most unpained come-back-if-you-break-up-with-your-new-love I've ever heard. I like every cut. Just wish I loved one.

It remains a scandal that the most prolific, protean, and flat-out talented of the younger jazzmen still records for an Italian company. But he's got hotter ways to curry Blue Note's favor.

The miraculous ""Pass the Dutchie"" was originally a fine Mighty Diamonds song called ""Pass the Koochie,"" so even though the arrangement is pure genius and the switch from ganja (a koochie is a pipe) to food (a dutchie is a cookpot) pure social responsibility, they've yet to write their first hit. And with reggae bands, not to mention kid bands (even English bands), one-shots are an old story. So I regret to report that the album evinces neither pop songcraft nor the signature groove with which seasoned reggae artists compensate. And am surprised to add that between young Kelvin's biddle-biddle toasts and the reggae songcraft they do command--check out ""Youth of Today"" and ""Young Generation""--they almost get by and then some.

FALSE,B,I Can See Clearly Now,Johnny Nash,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7494,"
Based on a simple, undemanding, slightly syncopated rhythmic figure that sounds like it was lifted from ""Wimoweh"" and is broken only by a chorus of angels, its unremittingly cheerful tag line redeemed by the unexpected realism of ""I can see all obstacles in my way,"" the title song is the first true reggae ever to go top ten in the U.S. It's also the kind of single that can get you through a traffic jam. The album melds Caribbean soul--composer Bob Marley's is the best--with Nash's diffident, church-derived televisable vocal conception. It might get you through a day in the country if all the other available music were by Chuck Mangione.

Wisely, this takes off on specifically aural phenomena: radio above all, but also telephone tapes, other comedy records, and confession.

What can it mean when all I'm sure of after playing an album a dozen times is that the band likes Wire a lot? But in the end I give them considerable credit for keeping their taut drone on my turntable long past the point when I've sent umpteen similar bands to the warehouse. Which reminds me that in today's permeable musical atmosphere it's conceivable they've never even heard Wire, just Wire's ideas. And actually, I'm also sure they feel ""Hoodwinked,"" the lead cut that kept me coming back after six or seven spins. I bet I even know why they feel hoodwinked. But not because they helped me figure it out. Recommended to rabid formalists and rabid Pink Flag fans.

Over the four or five albums of a commercial decline that's probably permanent, he's proven more George Jones than Merle Haggard. That is, he's a genius interpreter who always stands a chance of hitting you where you live--even though, like Merle, he still occasionally writes his own, and because of rather than despite the show of laziness the two share. Assuming you can stomach many strings and two pretentious clinkers (the title trope plus one called ""If I Were a Painting""), this is his best of the period, maybe because he put the least effort into it--it's when he tries to sing powerfully, or traffics in concepts like the '50s standards of What a Wonderful World, that he flounders. Sometimes, of course, his modest efforts come across flat; sometimes, no doubt, they really are lazy. But most of these murmured tributes to good love getting better and gone bad are touching and apt.

As a staunch admirer of ""You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd"" who's had less than no use for Miller since he got serious, I'm almost persuaded by this tribute-to-the-composer cum duo quickie. In fact, one more standout like ""Old Friends"" (including Ray Price), ""Sorry Willie"" (didn't know you thought she was your darlin'), and ""When a House Is Not a Home"" (one of Nelson's patented dry-eyed weepers) would make the difference.

I don't know if he's serious about this ""free from euphemisms and alive with their own emotions"" stuff he writes about in the notes, but one reason I like his songs is that they never seem to mean exactly what they say--even ""Joanne,"" which could be covered by Paul Butterfield or Linda Ronstadt or somebody, partakes of the bemused natural distance that saves his more aimless experiments from getting lost.

Backed by bass and drums from 10,000 Maniacs of Jamestown, New York, James Scott Reilly and Reese Edward Campbell Jr. of Warren, Pennsylvania, make songs out of the shopping malls and bad marriages of their shitty little town (well, that's what they seem to think). Their Byrdsy hooks (out of R.E.M., by 10,000 Maniacs) decorate dense yet literal lyrics--lyrics whose specifics sour as you listen.

Six of these fourteen wonderful songs are on Newman's first album and four on his second, all set off by the arrangements that are the other half of his gift, none crippled by one-take vocals.

The State Department says they can't tour the U.S.--""no artistic merit."" You can understand why they think this reflects on their politics, which are in the old English tradition of left chauvinism--they hate consumer blandishments with a passion that springs not from their readings in Hans Magnus Enzensberger but from a natural militance that deplores softness in class allies. Such an ideology would exclude artistic merit in the minds of most bureaucrats (as indeed would many other ideologies, not to mention the presence of electric guitars), and that's abhorrent. I'd be hard-pressed to argue compelling positive distinction on an often plodding football-punk sort of album, its words sharper in tone and spirit than content. But I'd give it a try.

Once you get past the underwhelming Jo'burg-goes-B'way rhythm section and the overpowering Jo'burg-takes-B'way chorus, Ngema's background as a township guitarist makes itself heard. The man projects so powerfully that you begin to think his political commitment, theatrical gifts, and way with South African English could make mbaqanga a truly international style. Then you notice that while in Sarafina! the girls take over, the villains of these pieces--a golddigger, an aborter, and an informer--are all women. Ain't contradiction the shits?

I've never quite gotten with the abbreviation. New doesn't mean cute, or fancy, or at least it shouldn't, and rhythm-and-blues doesn't mean this. I don't understand why they turned the Q into Quintet by adding singer Frank Gadler, either--all he's ever added is more cuteness, even doing a John Sebastian on one cut. They're tuneful as hell, but so arch--""Who Put the Garlic in the Glue?"" indeed--that the only tune I can bear to contemplate is ""Magnet."" Which attracts me like one. See, they've got me doing it. Yuk.

This band continues to live up to its full name (now Quartet rather than Quintet again), suggesting a cross between a chamber group (virtuosity and rhythmic decorum) and the New Lost City Ramblers (intelligent folkiness). Terry Adams plays rock and roll like a man who knows jazz wasn't invented by Chick Corea, and I do enjoy their sense of humor--the organ pumping into ""C'Mon if You're Coming,"" or the out-of-synch, out-of-timbre Adams blues piano that undercuts ""Blues Stay Away From Me."" But I get no sense of why they engage in this musicianly reconstruction of r&amp;b tradition; the jokes, none of which would make Carson, are what there is of a point. And if I'm going to listen to rock and roll without overdrive I need more reason than that.

The first live album by the Northeast's finest road band stands a chance of showing the rest of the world what it's been missing.

At least half the titles aren't ""standards."" I mean, Rice &amp; Webber? Early Loretta Lynn? ""Scarlet Ribbons""? An anticlericalist sermon? A putative Marilyn Monroe song that made a bigger splash when Helen Kane did it in 1928? A samba? Doris Day's ""Secret Love"" (which as it happens was the first record I ever bought, though I came to prefer the B side, ""The Deadwood Stage"")? All they share (except for the sermon) is that they are not rock (and also, conceivably, that O'Connor grew up with them, as she claims). But unlike La Ronstadt, O'Connor has no not-rock audience, and little not-rock savvy. Instead of hiring some reasonable substitute for Nelson Riddle--Billy May, or her Red Hot + Blue crew--she relies on high-grade hacks like Torrie Zito and Rob Mounsey. Even thorough their blare she sounds so defiant, so vulnerable, so sexual that at times she could be the greatest natural singer since Aretha. So up till the last three cuts, she almost gets away with it. But she doesn't.

Arif Mardin has neutralized O'Keefe's folk-Muzak potential by embellishing it--better his studio-rock ""Good Time Charlie"" than Ahmet's folkie-rockie-with-flute one, and not just because it got O'Keefe on the radio. In a neon romantic like O'Keefe--who sounds most at home telling junkie stories or covering ""Honky Tonkin'""--spectral percussion, a steel guitar mixed for eerieness, even a clarinet function as intelligent new-schlock shading that acknowledges his fundamental commercialism. And commercial he is--just about every song has a melodic hook. Though we'd be better off without one on ""Shooting Star"" (""the morning is waiting for Electra""?) and ""The Valentine Pieces"" (don't ask).

With their shrill tantrums and chaotic coherence, these three nine-yes-nine-year-olds win a hardcore novelty prize on aptness of sound alone. Shit does stand out, too: ""Hot Dog Hell"" (""Whoever works here doesn't know how to cook a hot dog""), ""Kill a Dead Eagle"" (""You can't kill a dead eagle/Just like you can't kill a devil with a bomb""), ""Homeless"" (""I hate you, Ronald Reagan""), and especially ""AIDS."" ""We don't know that much about AIDS,"" they sing, for all of us. ""How does it make you feel?/I feel afraid.""

FALSE,B,In Dreams: The Greatest Hits,Roy Orbison,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5578,"
From Chuck Berry on Mercury to the reunited Everlys, rerecorded best-ofs like this one rarely deliver magic or chops. The youthful buoyancy that kept the melodrama from getting soggy is in short supply, and without much trade-off in the standard interpretive nuance. A quarter-century later, his voice still socks and soars, and if on some songs--""Pretty Woman"" of course, ""Blue Bayou,"" ""Candy Man""--it's clear that only the original artyfact will do, nobody who wasn't there would swear to the general inferiority of this marginally more tasteful recreation. After all, just exactly how great were his hits? Crowning him rock's first neurotic is as overwrought as damning Donald Duck for a protofascist--pop-rock (cum countrypolitan) self-pity has its own conventions just like slapstick did, and he is their slave. So as a heretic who isn't positive Phil Spector was good for rock and roll, and also as a heretic who was there, I'll stick with the artyfacts after all. They're certainly no worse. And versions you don't need.

FALSE,B,Mystery Girl,Roy Orbison,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5579,"
If you're guessing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity squandered by the assembled bigshots, guess again. They've done their man's tradition proud. Problem's the tradition--just listen to the latest Rhino retrospective, which celebrates its inevitable schlockification at MGM, and you'll know why Orbison's comeback was made for this corporate era. When he gets a great tune produced just right--Wilbury-penned lead hit, Bono-Edge title ballad, Waylon's ""In Dreams"" sequel--his unassuming seriousness can make you think twice about opera. But with his mythic voice no longer distinguishing surely between tenderness and sentimentality, ""A Love So Beautiful"" and ""Windsurfer"" are bathos. And when Elvis C. leaves him stranded atop a ferris wheel and he just sits there contemplating his tragedy in song, the only thing mythic is the scale of the self-parody.

Now that they've come down a little I can take their sad tales of hard days seriously. Even on ""Junk Culture"" proper, which stirs up memories of their direct atmospherics, they do their best to cheese things up, and elsewhere hurdy-gurdy synths and android girlies emitting no-no-nos do right by the title, a title anybody who once dubbed an album Architecture and Morality had damn well better earn.

I'm trying to figure out what it means to say I kind of like this record, a big-budget multiproducer job of the sort suddenly standard in crossoverland. It's not just that I'm impressed with all the heavy equipment, from Osborne's dolomite voice to the usual phalanx of hitmen turning out materiel. I respond--that's one thing kind of liking it means. And though the response feels synthetic, it's not unreal. Which is just what I'd say of the emotions on display, from be-mine to Soweto-must-be-free.

""Criss-cross rhythms that explode with happiness,"" promises this London-based African and West Indian troupe, but they can't leave it at that, and neither singer-guitarist Wendell Richardson nor singer-saxophonist Teddy Osei explodes with very much of anything.

FALSE,B,80's Ladies,K.T. Oslin,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1970,"
After ""Do Ya',"" side two is dreck, squeezing its sob stories down to the last overripe chord change, but when she asserts herself this countrypolitan career woman can tell you more about the vagaries of erotic love than two male neotraditionalists half her age combined. Not surprisingly, she asserts herself only when she writes a song all by her lonesome--on ""80's Ladies,"" ""Younger Men,"" and ""Do Ya'"" too. And the only tune she didn't have a hand in is a sob story that should convert anyone who thinks lady songwriters shouldn't launch singing careers in the prime of life. A voice she's got.
"
FALSE,B,This Woman,K.T. Oslin,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5583,"
The songwriting may never kick in full time, though it sure has its moments--when a girl with a new used car invites a cute young thing out for a spin, or a single begins her status report with a quiet ""I'm overworked and I'm overweight."" But there are other reasons to root for this full-timbred New York-based outsider--not only does she challenge Nashville's hidebound gender roles, but she doesn't cotton to neotraditionalist canons. In fact, her music hints at pop, and if you think that has to mean schlock or rock, don't tell the guitarists.
"
FALSE,B,Phase III,The Osmonds,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11258,"
No, I'm not being perverse. In fact, the first side to this lp--which includes two great singles (""Yo-Yo"" and ""Down by the Lazy River"") and two good white soul-rockers and an acceptable-plus ballad--is such great AM music that I'm tempted to go higher. Unfortunately, the other side is a stinker, from Jesus-rock to studio jollity. One album a year and they might be very good indeed.

FALSE,B,Himself,Gilbert O'Sullivan,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7571,"
I admit I ignored this until the advent of the genius single ""Alone Again (Naturally),"" which I like best for the way its tossed-off structure matches its casual, crucial equation of filial and romantic affection. But I insist I was always intrigued by the idea of a singer-songwriter managed by the same godfather who brings us Tom Jones and Englebert Humperdinck. He's uneven, and he may turn into a major annoyance, but before that happens we ought to acknowledge that he's also a complete original. Persona: insecure lower middle-class Irishman with a screw loose. Message: it's normal to have a screw loose. Rhymes: ""Nothing Rhymed.""

""Farm Rap"" is recommended to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""No Dick"" to the Meatmen.

FALSE,B,Another Grey Area,Graham Parker,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5589,"
Mixed success isn't becoming to Parker, who can no longer blame his bad personality on unemployment. By replacing the Rumour with studio regulars, he's lost the edgy drive that used to help his bitterness cut through, and his revitalized melodic craft only takes him so far--if hooks don't justify kneejerk sentimentality, they don't justify jerkoff paranoia either.

Once a big man on the blues circuit, Parker was turning into the forgotten Beale Streeter by the time he died last year, and this is a respectful farewell--Sonny Lester, who wrecked his recent collaboration with Jimmy McGriff, keeps things simple (well, fairly simple). Never as penetrating as B.B. or Bobby, Parker smooths his way over the arrangements with the calm of a man who was mellow before the concept existed, at least in its present deracinated form. Highlight: the sad, true story that goes with ""Funny How Time Slips Away.""

""I Still Can't Get Over Loving You,"" his sweetest, sexiest hit ballad ever, rips Brit synth-pop as shamelessly as ""The Other Woman"" ripped the Stones, but his grip becomes less definitive on the very next tune, which barely loosens the hem of Prince's garment. And side two holds on strictly to Ray's tried and true.

Even though P-Funk's second-string auxiliary has no Dawn Silva or Jeanette McGruder, this comes on as strong as Never Buy Texas From a Cowboy, because it doesn't take much for funk to come on strong. Just a few dance-phrases is all--""help from my friends,"" ""play me or trade me,"" ""now button it up, I'll put it away."" Endurance is something else. Watch them do their thang indeed.

What happens when a black harmony group names an album after the heaviest metal, depluralizes its name, and pluralizes its music? It may be pretentious bullshit, but it sure is interesting pretentious bullshit--bagpipes and steel guitars, Bach and rock, Satchmo as Kingfish, work chants as dozens, all in the service of a world view in which love/sex becomes frightening, even brutal, and no less credible for that.

On the first side A DJ who reminds me of original AM scatman Jocko Henderson jive-raps on the satisfactions of suffrage and then gives way to a danceable, listenable, forgettable groove. On the second side, interesting but hookless off-harmony excursions, two of them too slow and/or too long, break into some heavy funk for the ages.
"
FALSE,B,Bubbling Over,Dolly Parton,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5623,"
A better-than-average Parton album in many ways, but beyond the usual dull spots two cuts really bother me. Often her genteel aspirations are delightful--who else would pronounce it ""o'er our heads,"" just like in poetry books, instead of slurring ""over""? But when her sentimentality becomes ideological--""Babies save marriages,"" or ""Stop protesting and get right with God""--you remember why most great popular artists have rebelled against gentility.
"
FALSE,B,Love Is Like a Butterfly,Dolly Parton,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5625,"
Except for the title tune, the only really interesting songs here are two by Porter Wagoner--Dolly's already done a whole album of ""Take Me Back,"" and ""Bubbling Over"" is a lot more effervescent than ""Gettin' Happy."" Still, she repeats herself (and apes others) nicely enough. And blues strings followed by gospel medley rescues side two at the close.
"
FALSE,B,White Limozeen,Dolly Parton,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5794,"
The crossover that marked her new label affiliation never got to the other side, so she lets Ricky Skaggs call the shots--these days he's commercial. Except on the Easter song, he cans the production numbers, and since she can still sing like a genius anytime opportunity knocks, her most country album in years is also her best. Of course, even genius country singers are dragged by ordinary country songs. And though the borrowings are better-than-average, she no longer writes like a pro without help--here provided by, such is life, Mac Davis.
"
FALSE,B,Heroes,Tom Paxton,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5631,"
As dinky musically as any other electric folk session, but most of the songs escape the sentimental self-righteousness you expect from this old-timer. They're funny when they mean to be, which is often. And two very impressive farewells, to Phil Ochs and Stephen Biko, aren't funny at all.

Recommended to those who neglected to purchase ""Band of Gold"" (wedding-night impotence!) and/or ""Bring the Boys Home"" (Vietnam with violins! a black sister calling out for peace with her brother content to exhort from the background!), which together with two familiar-sounding tunes by label-owners Holland-Dozier-Holland and two entertaining soap operas make for as nice a side of minor Motown as you're likely to get from the original these days.

In the immediate wake of Teddy's break with Harold Melvin, this sounded like pure cop-'em cut-'em con-'em and account-'em, but time quickly proved it an ordinary quickie. That is, the first two tunes on each side, estimable though they are, aren't what make you forget the last two. It's the last two that make you forget the last two.

Whether he's flexing his chest at Madison Square Garden or inviting the (presumably female) listener into his shower, Teddy has a self-deprecating sense of humor that his obsessive male posturing tends to obscure. Call him butch rather than macho and be thankful for small favors.

FALSE,B,The Penguin Cafe Orchestra Mini Album,Penguin Cafe Orchestra,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5600,"
Simon Jeffes outlines a music from everywhere that could easily turn into a music for nowhere: ""music which is influenced by the above [classical, rock, jazz, folk] but also by African, Japanese, Venezuelan, Celtic (Scottish and Irish), Cajun, Reggae, and other sources."" But where Paul Winter, whose program isn't all that dissimilar, is half pundit and half mooncalf, Jeffes's gentle wit, unmystical posture, and fondness for urban life combat vague-out. Whether he also reaches the ""heart of our own time and culture,"" however, is another matter. His eccentric post-folk orchestrations seem more like escapes to me--into fantasy, into a future with reassuring connections to the past. Which makes this an odd piece of product. ""The Penguin Cafe Single"" is more useful here than the premature Music From the Penguin Cafe. The two new pieces are simple, charming, and very slight. And the three finest tunes, two in new but hardly definitive live versions, are also available on the nonmini album they put out in 1981, the length of which better suits the leisurely pace of Jeffes's panpop impressionism.
"
FALSE,B,Carl Perkins and NRBQ,Carl Perkins and NRBQ,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5647,"
This is uniformly pleasant, but Carl can't wear those shoes no more--he's an aging country singer who sounds it. And since he wrote about half of these tunes as well as singing half of them, we might mention that for the most part he's a competent and utterly unexciting composer. As for NRBQ, their jumpy version of that blues-bopping beat merges all too well with the novelty-music aspect of rockabilly--at times this sounds an itty bit cute. Cute and I like them: Terry Adams's hippie pastorale, ""On the Farm,"" and a Perkins guitar showpiece called ""Just Coastin'.""
"
FALSE,B,Street Corner Symphony,The Persuasions,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5652,"
If you believe acappella is inherently superior to ""commercial"" rock and roll, you'll prefer the Persuasions' covers to the Sam Cooke and Impressions and Temptations originals. But if you think it's an eccentric alternative, you'll note that Jerry Lawson's style is a punchier, less delicate variation on the sweet gutturals of David Ruffin, who himself barely gets by--with skillful help from Norman Whitfield--on a grade-B ballad like ""I Could Never Love Another.""
"
FALSE,B,We Still Ain't Got No Band,The Persuasions,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5653,"
On their r&amp;b album they go head to head with Jimmy Reed and outdo Sam Cooke as well as unearthing a doowop standard that Don Robey probably doesn't remember he wrote (if he did). They also go head to head with the Impressions, the Drifters, and the Coasters. And unearth a soul substandard by one Jimmy Hughes that will live on in the memory of Jimmy Hughes's mother.
"
FALSE,B,Disco,Pet Shop Boys,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2748,"
Serious about not being taken seriously, they set Shep Pettibone (or is that Pet Sheppibone?) to remixing their greatest hit, then ask Pet/Shep, Arthur Baker, and the Latin Rascals to remix three other fairly nifty songs from the only album they've ever released. Just for variety, the lead cuts are the B sides from their great hit and their lesser hit, and I confess I'm glad to own both, brand names and all. Also, ""West End Girls"" does hold up quite nicely for 9:03. Still . . .
"
FALSE,B,You're Gonna Get It!,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5613,"
"". . . might sound strange/Might seem dumb,"" Tom warns at the outset, and unfortunately he only gets it right the second time: despite his Southern roots and '60s pop-rock proclivities, he comes on like a real made-in-L.A. jerk. Onstage, he acts like he wants to be Ted Nugent when he grows up, pulling out the cornball arena-rock moves as if they had something to do with the kind of music he makes; after all, one thing that made the Byrds and their contemporaries great was that they just got up there and played. Thank God you don't have to look at a record, or read its interviews. Tuneful, straight-ahead rock and roll dominates the disc, and ""I Need to Know,"" which kicks off side two, is as peachy-tough as power pop gets. There are even times when Tom's drawl has the impact of a soulful moan rather than a brainless whine. But you need a lot of hooks to get away with being full of shit, and Tom doesn't come up with them.
"
FALSE,B,Hard Promises,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5609,"
Hard to gainsay the class solidarity of a rich rock star who sues his record company to keep his list price down to $8.98. And glancing at the lyric sheet, I was pleased to note that the antiboho number--""Kings Road,"" in which a Pakistani tries to sell Tom funny-looking English underwear--had a lighter touch than usual. The reason I hadn't noticed, unfortunately, is that Petty clobbers the thing like he's singing about how much he hates the road. Elsewhere he's more understated, fortunately, but it just goes to show you--no matter how much they respect the working fan, rich rock stars do tend to fill up on themselves.
"
FALSE,B,From a Whisper to a Scream,Esther Phillips,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5662,"
The idea is for her to go pop in two opposite directions--(black) rock material, which is good, and slick arrangements, which aren't. So while it's gratifying to hear her tackle Allen Toussaint, Marvin Gaye, and Gil Scott-Heron, whose song about a junkie with no reason to kick is her tour de force, Creed Taylor proves a thankless producer. It's not just the strings, but the way their simple syrup is played against climaxes that pack all the excitement of an escalator.
"
FALSE,B,"Alone Again, Naturally",Esther Phillips,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5663,"
Here Phillips gets too cocky with her song choices. By eschewing the piano hook, she covers ""Use Me"" without making you fantasize about Bill Withers. But Gladys Knight still owns ""I Don't Want to Do Wrong."" And Gilbert O'Sullivan still owns ""Alone Again, Naturally.""

FALSE,B,What a Diff'rence a Day Makes,Esther Phillips With Beck,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5665,"
When it works, Phillips's music balances good songs and a good beat. This time her new arranger tries to push her over into a disco groove, so it's not surprising that some of this sounds a little untracked.
"
FALSE,B,I Enjoy Being a Girl,Phranc,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5673,"
The first uncloseted lesbian to bed down with a major label since Isis, and what does she come up with? The cover design of the year and an album so arch it crumbles without a proscenium. Not that she never gets away with it--the chamber-styled Toys R Us tribute and the praisesong to Martina that spells out her nation of origin are worth hearing even after you know the jokes. Moreover, the few ""sincere"" numbers disappear instantly. But any record that makes its most effective political statement on behalf of child-eating polar bears is resorting to weirdness as a protective device.

It's good that Pickett is tempering his pricky masculinity with gospel compassion, but not so good that he's softening his edge. ""Sugar Sugar"" (which is fun) plus ""Hey Joe"" (which is I'm not sure) do not equal ""Hey Jude.""
"
FALSE,B,A Funky Situation,Wilson Pickett,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5680,"
Pickett's halfhearted disco move won't go over at the Loft, but it sure beats anything he did for RCA. ""Changed my clothes, but I didn't change my soul,"" he assures us, and that's it exactly. The production (by Rick Hall and Don Daily) and especially the horn arrangements (by Harrison Calloway, Jr.) are dense and eventful rather than overblown and crowded, and unlike so much disco they're designed only to kick ass, never to engulf and wash over. What's more, Pickett is singing again--rarely does he resort to the random scream. His own ""Lay Me Like You Hate Me"" is a startling distillation of what he's always really been about, and though most of the other songs are just ordinary-plus, they've been chosen with obvious care--no song-factory seconds here.
"
FALSE,B,The Dark Side of the Moon,Pink Floyd,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2774,"
With its technological mastery and its conventional wisdom once-removed, this is a kitsch masterpiece--taken too seriously by definition, but not without charm. It may sell on sheer aural sensationalism, but the studio effects do transmute David Gilmour's guitar solos into something more than they were when he played them. Its taped speech fragments may be old hat, but for once they cohere musically. And if its pessimism is received, that doesn't make the ideas untrue--there are even times, especially when Dick Parry's saxophone undercuts the electronic pomp, when this record brings its cliches to life, which is what pop is supposed to do, even the kind with delusions of grandeur.

FALSE,B,Surfer Rosa,The Pixies,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5690,"
By general consensus the Amerindie find of the year, and I'll say this for them: they're OK. Aurally articulate but certainly not clean, much less neat, with guitar riffs you actually notice and a strong beat that doesn't owe any subgenre. Feature a woman as equal partner--no separatism or blatant gender aggression. If I was on the lookout for contemporaries who proved my world wasn't coming to an end, I might overrate them too. In fact, maybe I still do.

Avant-pop fixtures in Japan, they're considerably more skillful than our home-grown lounge-wave bands. And despite sonics brittler than anything fashioned by Juan Garcia Esquivel, their fondness for post-1963 black dance music insures a better beat. But they have an attitude problem: an affectlessness that renders them more unreadable than Madonna or John Waters or the Pet Shop Boys or any other pop ironyworker except Saint Andy, who both invented the stance and did more with it. It's my policy never to give an inch to recording artists who say things like, ""Without the visuals, people wouldn't understand us."" And although I might get it if I were Japanese, I'm not. In fact, I could even surmise that their failure to reveal the emotional core that glints out from Madonna and Waters and especially the Pet Shop Boys bespeaks a repressed culture that has zero claim on an alien's empathy. But I won't.

Plant's recreations of Led Zep's sonic feel with more mundane musicians is quite impressive, always the operative superlative with him. It's also more insinuatingly hooky than Led Zep ever was.

FALSE,B,Now and Zen,Robert Plant,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5692,"
Plant's two earlier solo albums were striking and forgettable--bankable self-indulgences that turned a profit on brand loyalty alone. Because they had the virtue of existing, they inspired loose talk about who ""really"" led his former band, probably from people who secretly believed pomp made the band artistic. This time he looks to solidify his future by imitating his past--even sampling it, an idea he says he got from Rick Rubin (what a card), or hiring his former band's guitarist for a solo. At its best, it's far from forgettable. Overall effect is a cross between his former band and the Cars.

After I secured a CD, with both digital definition and the lyric sheet Island pulled from the vinyl correcting their chronic incomprehensibility, this phonogram finally began to make sense to me. But the horns still betoken folk-rockers moving on rather than the brass bands I bet they're supposed to evoke.

""All this rock and roll you hear don't mean a thing to me,"" they admit, although in other respects they seem like young women of superior intelligence. Really, sisters, we let rock and rollers redo Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross and sing Barbara Mauritz songs (good ones, anyway) and mention Volvos. Not to mention cover Lee Dorsey. Although encouraging the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils to play ""Wang Dang Doodle"" for seven minutes is a no-no.

Not to be confused with Regatta de Blanc, I don't think, this is where the latest vanguard of musicianly postminimalist abandons all pretense of pop (or reggae) mindlessness. Stewart Copeland's rhythms skank plenty while looting the whole wide world. Andy Summers's guitar harmonies are blatantly off-color, his melodic effects blatantly exotic. And Sting's words are about stuff--itchy general, teacher not petting with teacher's pet, plus, ahem, the perils of stardom. Summing it all up is their first true hit and only true masterpiece: ""De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da.""

The same sopranos who sound so right choraling through coproducer Philip Glass's rockish hypnorhythm pieces make this arty dance-rock band sound like, dare I say it, disco. At other points the music whispers, I feel constrained to add, Philip Glass. The strangulated vocals I blame on, who else, David Byrne. That it almost gets over anyway is a credit to crescendo techniques developed by, that's right, the Feelies--who could have used some coproduction themselves.

Unlike the Stooges' albums, this collection of doctored tapes from 1975 is never brought to a halt by some luded-out threnody. But it doesn't offer any necessities of life, either--no ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" or ""Search and Destroy,"" not even a ""Gimme Some Skin"" or ""Here Comes Success"" or ""China Girl."" And it sounds sludgy.

The craft that went into this record could pass for genius, and side one includes four or five memorable songs and one moment of wit--a line about a ""fuzzy-brained intellectual"" that reviewers delight in quoting. I guess I just expect more than one moment of wit per side from self-described intellectuals, even fuzzy-brained ones. Sententious pop at its best, recommended only to those whose taste for such junk amounts to a jones.

FALSE,B,A Legendary Performer,Elvis Presley,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5739,"
I'm told this compilation is his best in years, but what does that mean?

Why is the new Elvis Presley album slightly better (even according to the singles charts) than, for instance, the last Elvis Presley album? Because Elvis decided to make like a big baritone? After all, he's often horrible when he chooses that move. But inspiration is funny, and on this one he'll make you care about, for instance, how a clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿""Your Love's Been a Long Time Coming"" is going to end.

Deemed a worthy addition to the canon by hagiographers who label the First Live Recordings EP a rip, this apocrypha--dominated by bent unreleased versions (and songs) that include a genuinely embarrassing duet with Ann-Margret and a priceless live ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" in which the King collapses into giggles before he's done with the first chorus--marks the unchallenged ascension of Elvis Unmasked among the faithful. It's a fascinating document. I'd rather listen to the EP.

She's in a mature relationship, she loves motherhood, and she earns her keep fronting a band. The new guys are funkier than the old guys, the tunes are up to par, and despite ""How Much Did You Get for Your Soul?""--it's offensive to dis black pop when your idea of on-the-one is ""Fame"" cops--her lyrics are pretty mature, with a sisterly offering I'd like to hear some soul man put across.

Says Paul Hemphill: ""There might be something to the suspicion that he is Nashville's house nigger . . . if he didn't sing `Kawliga' better than Hank Williams did."" Wrong. First you sing real good, and then maybe they let you be a house nigger. Pride's amazing baritone--it hints at twang and melisma simultaneously, and to call it warm is to slight the brightness of its heat--loses focus as he settles exclusively into ""heart songs."" Though these tales of married love are worthy enough, only ""Is Anybody Goin' to San Antone"" ranks with ""Does My Ring Hurt Your Finger"" or ""Just Between You and Me"" or ""All I Have to Offer You,"" while ""I'm Just Me"" asserts an ""identity"" so vague it couldn't get him a tricycle license. In however irrelevant a way, ""Kaw-Liga"" at least acknowledged the existence of race, and ""The Snakes Crawl at Night"" at least cast him as a criminal. Neither was much to retreat from. But they helped round out a persona that's beginning to seem dangerously shallow.

As sheer aural sensation, this may be PIL's best, synthesizing the deep dubwise pessimism of The Metal Box with the sharp studiowise pessimism of Album. But as total experience, it's product. My favorite line was ""We want your money"" until I realized it really went ""We want your body""--another antisex rant, jeeze. Transcending John's unwavering self-regard is ""Fat Chance Motel,"" a definitive piece of aural sensation apparently conceived during a desert vacation he apparently didn't enjoy.

All these postdadaists want is to provide the forbidden visceral thrill of rock and roll at the moment they snatch it away as an impossible fake--to be the-thing and not-the-thing simultaneously. How much more could they ask of life? They have fair success, too, commanding an impressive palette of horrible noises and effectuating a pretty good beat for art-rock. But what you remember in the end is the snatch; you're left to mull over a concept that will thrill only those whose lived experience verifies it. Me, I don't find Route 66 has run out of kicks quite yet.

This Seattle sextet makes music for stewardesses if ever there was such a thing, and if you think I'm being condescending that's your problem--I'm awed. What a complex artifact! The lyrics Marv Ross writes for wife Rindy, who sings like a cross between Stevie Nicks and Olivia Newton-John and does clarinet impersonations on the saxophone, are all about how love doesn't last, especially with ""Valerie,"" Rindy's benefactor and then some during an ill-advised stint in art school. And the band, which boasts chops beyond tight, steals only from the masters--Steely Dan chords and guitars, Steve Stills and Joni Mitchell vocalisms, Fleetwood Mac ambience, and of course that soupï¿½ï¿½ï¿""Baker Street.""

Imagine an unironic Stanard Ridgway with the volume up to eight and you'll have a bead on the innate charms of Bob Walkenhorst's vocals. Seductive he ain't, and too bad, because he mostly outwrites Ridgway in his unironic way, counseling healthy excess in the battle against repression: ""Let My People Go-Go."" For better and worse, the band's as straight-up as the leader, who's got so much preacher in him that you wonder whether he believes anyone should get their government cheese.

Best cut: Allen Toussaint's ""What Is Success,"" about the ""so necessary"" spiritual expenditures entered above a record company's bottom line. Whereupon Raitt pays her tribute to schlock four times over. Typically, she can uncover a stirring moment in the most stillborn possible-single, but the limits of her integrity have already been defined by three flexible, often playful, yet obviously uncompromising albums, and when the strings and woodwinds rise up, they dispossess her. Even ""What Is Success"" suffers a setback when Raitt accedes to Toussaint's impersonal ""he."" That's no ""he,"" Bonnie--that's you.

""A lot of people were probably wondering when they heard about the pairing whether I was going to make a funk record like Was (Not Was),"" Bonnie surmises. Right--loyalists were shaking in their boots, I was licking my lips, and now the suspense is over, unfortunately. She deserves respect, not the obeisance she gets from career sicko Don Was, who fashions an amazing simulation of the El Lay aesthetic she helped perfect and we all thought he hated. Bonnie being Bonnie, it sounds perfectly OK, but most of the songs are so subtly crafted they disappear under her tender loving ministrations, and though Was lets her play guitar for the whole first side, his studio pros could just as well be Peter Asher's.

Lessee--forty-five-only mixes, archival 1910 Fruitgum cover, hmm. Look, kids, let me boil it down for you. First Ramones. Then Rocket to Russia. Then Too Tough to Die, which was 1984.

I admit that I like all four Eric Carmen songs here, especially the atypically guitar-tough ""I'm a Rocker,"" but I swear if there were more than four I'd like every one less.

She oversings, the band's ordinary, and the lyrics (both hers and those she chooses) often get blowzy; the only grade-A cuts are ""Jerry's Pigeons"" and (A plus) ""The Sweetest One."" So maybe I'm soft--maybe I just can't resist a real New York doll. In a woman who combines the hip cool of Lou Reed with the emotionality of Springsteen, a case of Joplinitis--a rare disease these days--is rather endearing.

Some find this teen-identified sexy mama--in ""Roto Root Her"" (her title, don't blame me) she demands an I.D. chain--embarrassing, others politically incorrect.

An exemplary, super-functional version of Eurodisco's electronic dream--synthesizers and power plectrums overlaid with what disco people call rock vocals. This last means you can tell it's a white man singing, and whoever emotes the uptempo stuff sure does sound like Mick Jagger alongside the gigolo imitator on ""My Desire."" Consistently spacey and sexy, the way this music is supposed to be, and who says it's apolitical? After all, if ""It's a shame to complain but we've got to have a lot more loving"" isn't a credo, what is?

Here they extend themselves thematically, and while it ain't bad for what it is, what it is is arty satire--""Sloths"" is smarter than ""The Devil Lives in My Husband's Body,"" but if it were really smart I couldn't make the comparison. Lora Logic has flown, as is her wont, leaving Mayo Thompson to vocalize, with the result that the same song which nails Jackson Pollock on the first album leaves me feeling sympathetic in this version. To paraphrase Pollock: ""An Englishman's an Englishman in thought and act/And you'd expect this analysis to be qualified by that fact.""

But it's 1980, and this ain't no soul group, and for better or worse, writing (not to mention singing) isn't what funk groups are about, as three slow ones that would have stymied even Otis III's dad demonstrate. Playing is what funk groups are about, and if you don't believe me, listen to Otis III on ""Doin' It"" and ""Funkin' on the One"" or Dexter anywhere.

FALSE,B,I Don't Know How to Love Him,Helen Reddy,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7610,"
Reddy applies a lean pop voice almost devoid of grit or melisma to what are basically rock songs--that is, songs conceived grittily and melismatically. At her best, as in the unadorned interpretations of ""Crazy Love"" and ""A Song for You,"" she sounds refreshingly clear-eyed. At her worst, on Mac Davis's ""I Believe in Music,"" she sounds like a Sunday School teacher pretending to be one of the girls. And the rest of the time she's holding gentility to a draw, or vice versa, as when the cellos that set up ""How Can I Be Sure"" turn into the violins that schmaltz it around.
"
FALSE,B,I Am Woman,Helen Reddy,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7611,"
The hit added many instruments and one conciliatory stanza to the debut-LP version, which may be the way the Grammy bounces but is also how Reddy's feeling these days. She is wife, with baby son and marital crisis behind her, and she's enjoying her success. Tom Catalano's discreet schlock is right for a celebration of connubial privacy like Kenny Rankin's ""Peaceful"" because it implies the affluence underlying her domestic contentment. This time, at least, the production doesn't drown out Reddy's essential intelligence, compassion, and confidence. But avoiding complacency may prove a problem.

Poised provocatively between revolutionary powerhouse and droning bore, the Lorries are yet another sign that music in Britain may yet again get as tough as life in Britain. The sound is New Order meets Test Dept., with singer Chris Reed having it both ways. Always a skeptic in re dirges, I wish they'd picked up the pace with a single like ""Spinning Round.""

In which Mr. Heroin promotes the '60s. Really. Just compare the studio-Velvets first side with the hodgepodge-Arista closer and tell me he wasn't more confidently himself--I mean happier--negating optimism than fumbling through its aftermath. Admittedly, beyond the inescapable ""Street Hassle"" the Arista song choices are perverse even for Lou--three from his album of six months ago, neither great one among them. And beyond the inescapable ""Walk on the Wild Side"" the RCA choices aren't much more coherent (cf. RCA's own Walk on the Wild Side). So Clive's minions hire Ellen Willis to make sense of it all--which, striving almost too mightily, she almost does.

This unabashedly literate album isn't pretentious on paper--Lou's just an educated guy for whom middlebrow names like Poe and Vidal and Shakespeare and Escher mix as naturally into the conversation as dictionary words like ""harridan"" and ""lucid"" and ""ore"" and ""encroachment."" But musically he's trying too hard with no place to go--projects the opener from midway down the esophagus as if Street Hassle leads to Street-Legal, then doesn't even stick with that. Mostly these are intelligent songs that misfire slightly. The two gems are two of the simplest both verbally and vocally. In one Lou's father gives him shit while his mother dies. In the other he proposes.

Young modern Lou makes his electronic move, dispensing with live drums on six tracks and leaving the programming to newly annointed computer whiz Fernando Saunders.

This veteran writer-producer has his soul in the right place--Miami, as far south as he can get it. And though he's a/k/a Blow Fly, purveyor of parody porn, the true Reid is as unyielding a moralist as Porter Wagoner or Ernest Tubb. He cheats a lot, just like his daddy, but he also pays--in one song, his ""real woman"" goes off to find ""a real man,"" while in another she simply kills herself and is he sorry. The only drawback is that Reid is a writer-producer for a reason--vocals.

Reid's strongest LP to date isn't quite strong enough.

Sound is more than adequate considering, songs mostly good-to-great, overall effect a little unrealized for my taste. I might want to hear them do ""Misty Mountain Hop"" twixt ""God Damn Job"" and ""I Will Dare,"" but twixt ""Iron Man"" and ""Heartbreaker"" I'll take Led Zep's.

Most of my informants prefer Meet the Residents or (especially) Third Reich n' Roll, with its disrespectful but familiar quotes from the likes of ""It's My Party"" and ""96 Tears,"" but I find this current album more listenable--Another Green World with a chip on its shoulder, sort of.

The futuristic, Mahavishnu-style jazz-rock gets hot enough at times to make you believe in spirit energy. But Corea's themes lack the grandeur of McLaughlin's, and what good is God without grandeur? Part of the problem is technical--when you articulate fast runs cleanly on an electric piano you sound precious almost automatically. Too often, though, I suspect that's what Corea wants. Better he should try for the cosmic joke--like when ""Captain Senor Mouse"" breaks into ""La Cucaracha.""

Greil Marcus argues that the former Wall of Voodoo frontman is ""playing with"" the American voice Raymond Chandler once described: ""flat, toneless and tiresome."" Pretty clever, only I don't hear much play. That voice is no creation--it's Ridgway, who shares with Chandler the literary sins of cynicism and literariness. Like a city reporter with a drinking problem or a novelist turned night clerk, Ridgway is a wise guy who isn't as wise as he thinks he is, and while a fair number of these songs have the sleaze-infatuated atmosphere L.A. artists from West to Waits have gone for, only a couple--""Walkin' Home Alone,"" a song of lost love any asshole would be proud of, and ""Pick It Up (And Put It in Your Pocket),"" the dirt on Reagonomics--belong in the same paragraph as Raymond Chandler.

Only ""Virgin Man,"" the most audacious and appropriate song he's written in years, kept Pure Smokey from drifting away. The title cut here announces Robinson's intention of distilling that drift into a style--rhythmically it seems to respond more to his internal state than to any merely physical criterion. Audacious in its way, and sexy, too, I guess, but he can't be my love man until he finds a beat. Which he does--not on the number-one soul hit ""Baby That's Backatcha,"" but as the record is drawing to a close, on ""Love Letters"" and the coy ""Coincidentally.""

He's lost purity on the high end, but the rich grain of his mature midrange more than compensates, and he's never sung with more care, intelligence, or yearning. Unfortunately, he hasn't settled for such ordinary material in years; his equation of love and ""irresistible merchandise,"" for instance, dishonors his penchant for the prepossessing polysyllable, and that's on the title cut. Does he almost get away with it anyway? Yes, he almost gets away with it anyway.

FALSE,B,One Heartbeat,Smokey Robinson,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8298,"
With executive producer Berry Gordy very hands-on, the man who named the quiet storm goes for his own--middle-aged platinum, just like Tina and Aretha and Dionne and Marvin, God rest his soul. After entrusting the lead single to outsiders who've made pop-funk their metier, he inputs some songwriting, with superpro results that carry the A. But only side two's ""Love Don't Give No Reason,"" one of those shocking domestic melodramas that have dotted his maturity, packs the slightest surprise. Moreover, I doubt he'll get his own. Being perpetually underrated ain't about talent--it's about glamour. As is middle-aged platinum.

FALSE,B,Never Gonna Let You Go,Vicki Sue Robinson,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4119,"
In the great tradition of Gloria Gaynor's Never Can Say Goodbye, you can not only dance to one whole side of this disco album but listen to it--and in the case of the emblematic ""Turn the Beat Around,"" bang the dashboard to it. In the same great tradition, side two is unmitigated crap. Next: Doreen Taylor's Never Get Off Your Back.
"
FALSE,B,Nurds,The Roches,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3829,"
They're trying too hard. The title cut's all moue and double-take, you can hear Suzzy upstaging her big sisters, and Maggie's side-closers are so intense and compressed it's impossible to know what they mean, though for sure a more experienced poet wouldn't put so much weight on her metaphors (chocolate versus soybeans somehow getting us to boat people living--and no doubt sufferin'--in Suffern, whew). Nor does Paul Simon henchman Roy Halee channel them the way Robert Fripp might have. Even so these songs have an almost magical esprit; Maggie's ""One Season"" will be in their act when they're fifty. Nobody in pop music equals their intelligence or delight. But I hope they calm down some.
"
FALSE,B,Get Yer Ya-Yas Out!,The Rolling Stones,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7655,"
Yeah, I was at the Garden when this was being recorded, and I had a great time. But despite Mick Taylor's guitar on ""Love in Vain"" and the spruced-up ""Live With Me,"" there's not a song here that isn't better somewhere else--including the two Chuck Berry covers and the one-act ""Midnight Rambler.""
"
FALSE,B,Goats Head Soup,The Rolling Stones,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3836,"
Except for the spavined ""Dancing With Mr. D,"" and the oxymoronic ""Can You Hear the Music,"" these are good songs. But the execution is slovenly. I don't mean sloppy, which can be exciting--I mean arrogant and enervated all at once. Mick's phrasing is always indolent, but usually it's calculated down to the last minibeat as well; here the words sometimes catch him yawning. Without trying to be ""tight"" the band usually grooves into a reckless, sweaty coherence; here they hope the licks will stand on their own. Only on ""Starfucker,"" the most outrageous Chuck Berry throwaway of the band's career, does this record really take off.
"
FALSE,B,It's Only Rock 'n' Roll,The Rolling Stones,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3837,"
This is measurably stronger than Goats Head Soup, and I hear enough new hooks and arresting bass runs and audacious jokes to stretch over three ordinary albums--or do I mean two? I also hear lazy rhymes and a song about dancing with Father Time and two sides that begin at a peak and wind down from there and an LP title that means more than it intends--or do I mean less?
"
FALSE,B,The Cutting Edge,Sonny Rollins,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11693,"
Rollins is one of those certified geniuses who didn't pan out for me when I had the time to investigate jazz, and although I hoped for belated paydirt from his first live album in years, more careful examination reveals that the straight melodies do get dull and the improvisations aren't rich enough to invite deep digging, just like all the jazz metallugists warned me.
"
FALSE,B,It's a Condition,Romeo Void,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8309,"
Those who find sex and love in the new bohemia a theme that hits home admire this for its literary value, but only one cut kicks it on back: the opener, ""Myself to Myself."" Until the likes of ""Charred Remains"" and ""Confrontation"" attain an equally hypnotic self-absorption, I'll relegate Debora Iyall's alienation tales to my sociology shelves.
"
FALSE,B,Silk Purse,Linda Ronstadt,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7662,"
This ought to be a good record. She's tough (and sexy) live, and she sure does pick good tunes--Mickey Newbury's new-Nashville ""Are My Thoughts With You?,"" which in Newbury's 45-rpm version has gotten a lot of play on my bedroom jukebox, says a lot about love and its dislocations, but so does Mel Tillis's old-Nashville ""Mental Revenge,"" which I'd never heard before. Country material over rock-flavored arrangements is the concept, and the honky vulgarity of Ronstadt's voice the reason. But only occasionally--""Lovesick Blues"" and ""Long Long Time"" are both brilliant--does she seem to find Kitty Wells's soul as well as her timbre.
"
FALSE,B,Prisoner in Disguise,Linda Ronstadt,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7666,"
I agree that this is a letdown after Heart Like a Wheel, but I wish someone could tell me why. Maybe the explanations are vague--she's repeating a formula, she's not putting out, etc.--because a singer like Ronstadt, who specializes in interpreting good songs rather than projecting a strong persona, must achieve an ineffable precision to succeed. But maybe it's simpler than that. People say her versions of ""Tracks of My Tears"" and ""Heat Wave"" are weak, but they're not--they simply don't match the too familiar originals. ""When Will I Be Loved?"" and ""You're No Good,"" on the other hand, were great songs half-remembered, kicking off each side of Heart Like a Wheel with a jolt to the memory. And this album could sure use a jolt of something.

FALSE,B,Living in the U.S.A.,Linda Ronstadt,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7671,"
This one divides right down the middle. The last four covers on the second side are so clumsy that I may never again hear the opener, Little Feat's ""All That You Dream."" But I do kind of like the first side, specifically including the forced intensity of the Chuck Berry and Doris Troy remakes. Only on ""Alison,"" though, does she enrich what she interprets.

FALSE,B,Root Boy Slim & the Sex Change Band Featuring the Rootettes,Root Boy Slim & the Sex Change Band Featuring the Rootettes,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7672,"
This band satisfies the first requirement of rock and roll comedy--they play their simplified Little Feat funk well enough to make fun of it. Inspirational Verse: ""Hey look out buddy/Get off my wig/Oops I didn't realize/You was quite so big.""
"
FALSE,B,Surrender,Diana Ross,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7676,"
This time the hits Ashford &amp; Simpson have written for Diana were written for Diana, which minimizes embarrassing comparisons. And the verve of side two--where Motown finally learns how to kowtow to Broadway and keep the songwriting royalties--suggests that she's learning to hold her own.

FALSE,B,The Boss,Diana Ross,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7682,"
In which La Suprema passes a crash course at the Ashford &amp; Simpson School of Total Adult Fulfillment, although not with As. It's her house, she wants your good lovin' once in the morning and once in the evening, she'll compete and regret it, she'll cooperate and be glad, and she shall survive, because she's the boss. Quite smart, quite sexy, but sometimes dull--it doesn't do much for A&amp;S's crash material that there's only one singer.

FALSE,B,All the Great Hits,Diana Ross,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8312,"
First time through this double I said fine, perfect in fact--only aficionados will remember anything else. Even ascertained that the fifteen-minute Supremes medley, segued together from the originals rather than recorded live with her show band, wasn't offensive. But it is useless, and it's also true filler--imagine, her entire solo decade has been good for less than four sides of compilable material. This woman is nothing without a context, and beyond the obvious, Rodgers &amp; Edwards are the only one she was ever made for--Ashford &amp; Simpson's domesticity still sounds awkward on her after years of familiarity, and her movie themes are no better than Shirley Bassey's. The great exception is ""Love Hangover,"" produced in 1976 by true hack Hal Davis, who with that song and that track could probably have gotten a disco classic out of June Pointer, Sarah Dash, Cindy Birdsong--though not Shirley Bassey.

FALSE,B,Crazy From the Heat,David Lee Roth,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8315,"
Since I'm a person of broader culture than the average Van Halen fan, it didn't smash my preconceptions to hear him cover the Beach Boys and the Spoonful and Dan Hartman and ""Just a Gigolo""--just irritated me, reconfirming my instinctive belief that he chose metal over Vegas because Vegas wouldn't have him. Way back when, that is--it's clearly where he'll end up if his movie career should fall through. And as it turns out, his movie career has softened me up--the panoply of grotesquely stereotyped caricatures who populate his videos grosses me out a little, but its capacity to shock is tonic in this bland musical moment. This is an adequate soundtrack.

FALSE,B,For Your Pleasure,Roxy Music,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3024,"
These guys make no secret of having a strange idea of a good time, but this isn't decadent, it's ridiculous. Side one surrounds two pained, strained torch jobs with two classic neo-rockers and finishes with a song about an inflatable sex doll that's almost not stupid (title: ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache""). Side two surrounds a fast fast one with two long mostly instrumental slow ones that are almost not boring. Verdict: almost not not bad.
"
FALSE,B,Viva! Roxy Music,Roxy Music,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3028,"
This isn't bad, not for a live album issued in lieu of current studio product. Concentrating on relatively obscure material from the first two LPs, which always sounded a bit thin, it adds humor and some untrammeled Phil Manzanera to ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache."" But I prefer the studio ""Bogus Man"" and ""Chance Meeting,"" thin and all. And that is bad.

FALSE,B,Flesh and Blood,Roxy Music,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3030,"
Except maybe on ""My Only Love""--imagine a song of that title written for (no, rejected by) Perry Como--this never sinks to their Liebschmerz-drenched nadir. But the secondhand funk is getting too easy to take. Much as I enjoy the languorous ""Midnight Hour"" and above-it-all ""Eight Miles High,"" I always get suspicious when covers overwhelm originals.

When it comes to El Lay punk, you take the sun-addled Germs and Circle Jerks and Dickies and leave me these stagestruck outlanders, Doug Fieger production and all. At least they understand what being phony means. ""Young and Dumb"" doesn't replace From Akron's definitive ""Brain Job"" because it's not about the Rebs. But anybody who can link the hallowed anomie of (the Pistols') ""No Feelings"" to the cartoon cannibalism of (the Rebs') ""Child Eaters"" deserves to tour with the Psychedelic Furs.

FALSE,B,I Am My Brother's Keeper,The Ruffin Brothers,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7687,"
The Mississippi-bred Ruffins are as close as Motown gets to Southern soul, so it's probably geography that makes their approach more Sam &amp; Dave than James &amp; Bobby Purify--all growling melismatics, with Jimmy's higher and much narrower timbre providing sweet relief from David's rough power. And for once in Motown's life there are a lot of good covers--from Ben E. King, Jerry Butler, even the Delfonics (even James Taylor).

With Chaka Khan pushed up front this looks like L.A.'s answer to Tower of Power--white funk players behind black singer. Chopswise neither the hornless five-piece band nor the horny three-octave voice is up to Oakland's pride, but I prefer the attitude, which is to admit your limitations and keep it simple. Maybe no one would have noticed if Stevie Wonder hadn't given them ""Tell Me Something Good."" But he did.

No doubt they think they're getting classy, but I think they're getting cute--compare the hip-skipping ""On Time"" to last year's booty-bumping ""Rufusized."" They're also starting to keep the composing royalties in the family. Exception, Bee Gees Go Home Division: Chaka's up-and-over ""Jive Talking.""

FALSE,B,Faithful,Todd Rundgren,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3969,"
As you probably know by now, one whole side recreates six '60s studio masterpieces note-for-note, from the calculated spontaneity of Bob Dylan to the electronic perfectionism of the Beach Boys and the Beatles. This is impressive and amusing, you can fool your friends, but it's overwhelmed (once you've heard it a few times) by what might be called the Enoch Light (or Your Hit Parade) (or voiceprint) effect. That is, Todd's vocal imitations (a phrase that deserves one of his slurs) sound thin and forced. This is especially notable considering how well his voice works on the other side, his clearest and most interesting set of songs since Something/Anything. It also reinforces the unfortunate impression that even when clearly interesting, Todd is factitious and compulsively secondhand.

FALSE,B,Runt,Runt,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3964,"
If there were any justice, ""We Got to Get You a Woman"" would melt Ti-Grace Atkinson's heart and ""I'm in the Clique"" would earn the artiste a free night at the Record Plant. But they're not playing the single on WBAI, and the artiste, ex-Nazz and present whiz Todd Rundgren, already knows his way around. Takes a certain professional brass to write a song called ""There Are No Words"" that goes ""Oh, Ah, OOOOO""--or to assume the persona of a newborn twin, especially for nine minutes.
"
FALSE,B,The Ballad of Todd Rundgren,Runt,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3965,"
If pop can be either sunny or moony, this is green cheese. And though it's less wildly uneven than its predecessor, that cuts two ways--the boyish ""Be Nice to Me"" and the mock-macho ""Parole,"" while quite nice, will never call me back to the ordinary stuff the way Runt's prize runts did.

Russell knows how to put music together, but he still has trouble putting it across. His Okie-cum-Brooklyn (ersatz Nworleans?) drawl is the outcry of a confused homeboy driven to fuse rootsy eccentricities with masscult shtick and flash, and his meaningfulness clarifies nothing. The Dylan covers here are trying to tell us something, but in the end Russell's newfound (and competent enough) zeitgeistery (""Stranger in a Strange Land"") and protest (""Alcatraz"") aren't as interesting as the injokey ""Ballad of Mad Dogs and Englishmen."" Which tells us something else.

If the first one was their acid album this 1969 session is their protest album, beginning and ending with advice to a ""straight brother"" and featuring a revised ""Sweet Home Chicago"" (for Mayor Daley and his ""northern rednecks""), a soppy antiwar song, a scabrous antiwar song, and a confusing anti-smoking song. As well as four love songs that will never make Merv Griffin, one because it advocates ""eating salty candy.""

FALSE,B,What I Did on My Vacation,Mitch Ryder,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7707,"
What he remembers best, apparently, is sex with men, and the songs that result put across all the sin, fear, passion, love-and-hate, pleasure, and release that buggery seems to have involved for him. The lyrics sometimes lack coherence, and the music is a more sensitive version of the now outdated r&amp;b-based guitar flash he favored with Detroit back in 1970. But the overall effect is revelatory.
"
FALSE,B,Diamond Life,Sade,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8329,"
Though there's not much range to her grainy voice or well-meaning songwriting, she and her associates put their project over, and with a fashion model's virtues--taste, concept, sound (cf. ""look""). There's no superfluity, no reveling in la luxe, not even an excessive tempo. Which is no doubt why I find myself crediting her humanitarian sentiments, even preferring her ""Why Can't We Live Together"" to Timmy Thomas's equally spare but naive original. And why those who find ""Hang On to Your Love"" and ""Smooth Operator"" seductive (instead of just warming, like me) will think they carry the whole album.

FALSE,B,Promise,Sade,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8330,"
Even when it's this sumptuous, there's a problem with aural wallpaper--once you start paying attention to it, it's not wallpaper anymore, it's pictures on the wall. And while as a wallpaper these pictures may be something, they can't compete with the ones you've hung up special. That's why I prefer my aural wallpaper either so richly patterned you can't see past the whole (Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians) or so intricately worked you can gaze at the details forever (Eno's Another Green World). In between I'll take Julie London.

""Shake Your Thang"" is a stroke because as a duo they can come out for two opposing sexual prerogatives at once--one does, the other doesn't, and it's nobody's thang but hers either way. Nor does E.U. hurt their soul. Elsewhere, the confusion signalled by the ""See label for Sequencing"" is reflected in ordinary rhymes, scattershot beats, and a second Isleys cover, this one masquerading as a Beatles cover.

FALSE,B,Sanders' Truck Stop,Ed Sanders,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1130,"
This is literally a country-rock takeoff--not a parody but a departure. But though I hesitate to criticize a man who is not only a saint and a genius but who says hello to me at the post office, I must point out that the yodeling country twang Sanders developed with the Fugs has never known the difference between parody and departure, which makes some of these songs seem crueller than they're intended to be. Of course, sometimes they're cruel on purpose--like ""The Iliad,"" a saga of good old queer-bashing with a Greek-to-me intro. And sometimes, like ""Jimmy Joe, the Hippybilly Boy,"" they're--snurfle--lyrical and sad.

FALSE,B,Santana III,Santana,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7714,"
In theory, the polyrhythms intensified the momentum while the low-definition songwriting served the freeflow gestalt. In fact, the Latin lilt lightened the beat and the flow remained muddy indeed. So the electricity generated by the percussion-heavy opening cut comes as a pleasant surprise, and the movement of what follows is a surprising pleasure. New second guitarist Neal Schon deserves special thanks for crowding out Gregg Rolie's organ. Maybe soon he'll come up with more than one idea per solo.

Bill Graham and David Rubinson augment Sri Chinmoy's everybody's-everything strategy with direct-hit tactics as Carlos resumes his attack on the rock marketplace. Greg Walker doubles credibly as soul man and sonero, and ""Dance Sister Dance"" is the band's all-time hottest original even if it is lifted form a universal salsa riff. As Armando Peraza proves (on ""Gitano""), better salsa conservatism than samba impressionism. And as Carlos proves, better salsa than Wes Montgomery at his schlockiest or a tune called ""Europa"" that lives up to its name.

First side is somehow sui generis and foreordained at the same time, and how to describe it? Flipper doing Afropop originals? Maturing hardcore boys who like Talking Heads more than the Doors?

Like his great (also greater) exemplar, Leo has abandoned all pretensions mid-career (except on the title cut). And sure enough, Warners has now broken three big singles off this album, which makes 1977 the year of Leo Sayer the way 1976 was the year of Fleetwood Mac. Not quite as gratifying, is it? My pick for number four: ""I Think We Fell in Love Too Fast,"" a natural for the young divorcee crowd.

When Scaggs announces that his girl is a looker because ""she looks like she's standin' right there,"" you believe he's got a right to sing like Neil Young wishing he were Smokey Robinson.

"
FALSE,B,My Time,Boz Scaggs,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7738,"
In search of the perfect makeout music for ex-hippies, Scaggs ditched his band of bohos halfway through and hied to Muscle Shoals, where the laid-back lie down with the overproduced as a regular thing. It may just be my imagination, but except for ""Dinah Flo"" and ""Slowly in the Wind""--written by his bassist, David Brown, who's challenged Scaggs with cryptic lyrics on all of his Columbia albums--I think I like the boho stuff better.

Scaggs obviously labored over this one, getting every second so right that there wasn't a whole lot left. After dozens of listenings I'm convinced that side one is tedious and side two quite listenable. But it wasn't worth my trouble--or his.

FALSE,B,Total Jive,The Scene Is Now,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6091,"
The rhythms and harmonies are properly knotty, the ideology grounded, the prosy, dissociated lyrics never corny. The singing is more tuneless than the tunes can afford, the politics more situationist than the sense of detail requires, the poetry insufficiently suggestive/evocative. Bohemia strikes again.

""Summer in Hell,"" about the ultimate in endless parties, and ""Monster,"" about Fred's penis, might have made the next B-52's album a great one. ""It's Time to Kiss,"" with Patti LaBelle raring to go, probably wouldn't fit, but that doesn't go for such lesser tracks as ""Orbit"" and ""This Planet's a Mess,"" both of which could use a shot of Cindy &amp; Kate.

FALSE,B,Saturday Night,Schoolly-D,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5954,"
Maybe two of the three new cuts on this fattened major-label reissue are weak, but liberals will certainly be heartened by ""Housing the Joint""'s explicit denial of those ""racism"" rumors. Me, I don't give a shit one way or the other, because even though the subtlety would be lost on me if he held a .357 to my head or gang-banged my bitch in the back room, I'm certain that the secret fascination this professional B-boy holds for white critics isn't just his exotic brutality, which he certainly makes the most of--""motherfucker"" is such a rhythmic word. It's his intimations of vulnerability--not L.L. Cool J's romantic shit, but something wryer and stupider. What other rapper would write a rhyme about the night his mother pulled a gun on him--or make it so clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove. Docked a notch for gang-banging a bitch in the back room.

Some call Schoolly's show of racial solidarity a career move, but I find Sly and P-Funk and Malcolm and James I-Am-Somebody and Richard Pryor's coke routines a productive use of his sound--almost believe ""Pussy Ain't Nothin'"" is designed to convince the womenfolk that he wants their brains.

With Malcolm Cecil coproducing, Scott-Heron's music comes back strong--the horns and rhythm are progressive funk as it was meant to be, Tower of Power without Vegas, dissonant and intricate and talky and natural. But the Caribbean inflections are compromised enough to suit a lyric that sounds commissioned by the Jamaican Tourist Board if not Edward Seaga himself, and while this album has plenty of good parts, they come together only on the side-openers: two on side one, one on side two.

Quite rapidly, Scott-Heron has developed into a reliable pro, like some old country singer. The music and singing provide lasting service, and the words evolve with the times, which is the point. In a self-annointed aesthete, that would be tantamount to failure, but for a message artist it's high praise. As long as his eye stays fresh, I don't believe Scott-Heron can make a bad album, and his fans will like this one OK.

The improvement in this poet-turned-musician suggests that white singer-songwriters could benefit from commitment to a musically sophisticated culture. He's got it, and he flaunts it. The singing will get stronger, and maybe someday every lyric will compare with the inspiring, despondent ""Winter in America."" In the meantime, the free-jazz-gone-populist band generates so much rhythmic energy that it carries over the weak spots. One heartfelt suggestion: no more long poetry reading, at least on record. I laughed at ""Pardon Our Analysis"" the first time, but now I find myself avoiding side one.

FALSE,B,"Plus, Also, Too--",Scrawl,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8341,"
As female-identified garage-rock, this never attempts to glorify its ineptitude with swagger or poetry--it has the guts to make plain that ineptitude isn't so damn far from vulnerability. Too often, right, it's merely inept--tuneless and quiet instead of tuneless and loud. But when S. Hershe worries that she's turning into ""a slut,"" or wonders if she should ""decide not to worry,"" or simply sings ""I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm so fucking sad,"" her brains could break your heart.

With the force of religious conversion, abrasive anarchist Green Gartside emerges as a pop-funk sweety-pie. Though he'd sing like Al Green if could, he settles for a gentle conversational tenor but tries too hard. The lyrics always bespeak literacy and sometimes deliver wit (""I was like an industry/Depressed and in decline""), as does the music, which shores up the out-of-pocket rhythms with tunes rather less often it undercuts them with dissonance. He's still in the deconstruction business, after all. The one that goes ""My sincerity, my penicillin, my window, and my drudgery"" is called ""Jacques Derrida.""

As the notes say, it's rare for a young bluesman to defy the commercial realities and try to develop his own writing and playing style. What they don't mention is that the writing has a ways to go. But I like the coarse flow of his ""scruffling"" guitar, especially in a distort mode--like the choked comping behind ""Your Love Is Like a Cancer,"" which neatly enough is the album's most striking lyric.

FALSE,B,Love's Melodies,The Searchers,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8344,"
I kept listening to this record at the behest of two dear friends--Tom Smucker, known Beach Boys fanatic, and Greil Marcus, all-purpose self-starter. Eventually I got it, too. It's bigger and glossier and rockinger than anything they managed as the second-best group in Liverpool, and not only that it's more tuneful. They even cover Big Star's ""September Gurls,"" which shows true power-pop hip. But for me it's a big, glossy, rocking, tuneful bore, because except on ""Radio Romance"" (""I love the radio/But the radio don't love me""), their only discernible motive is to take what they did well back in the '60s and do it even better, i.e., more professionally. Back in the '60s they had more motive than that.

Sebastian is as on for this solo debut as he ever was for the Lovin' Spoonful, and when he's on, the hummability quotient of his songs is dizzying--a good half of these imprint themselves upon impact. But just like Spoonful albums used to, this drags in the second half, and I feel vaguely let down. Maybe it's the gently paternalistic sexism of ""She's a Lady"" and ""What She Thinks About."" Or maybe it's his taste in T-shirts.

In 1966, Seely's ""Don't Touch Me"" took country women's sexuality from the honky-tonk into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards. But never again did she find a song at once so moral and so febrile.

The impassioned remakes from Beautiful Loser on side one are what live doubles are supposed to be for, and this one is sparing with the cheerleading and calisthenics. In short, it's good of its kind.

The songwriting's sharper, but he's not. Whether their focus is personal (""Like a Rock""), social (""Miami""), or personal-as-social (""Tightrope""), all his evocations of this rock and that hard place add up to is high-grade soap opera. Between John Robinson's measured arena beat and Craig Frost's Bittanesque semiclassicisms, Seger comes on as a world-weary elder statesman, which is to say an incurable cornball. Transcending all this is ""The Ring,"" the tale of a good marriage that didn't get it all, and too bad Bruce won't cover it.

Selvidge's voice is so rich it's a curse, especially since it's combined with a good-humored grasp of blues tradition--all he has to do is release the notes and people tell him he's a genius. On this evidence, Selvidge is only a craftsman. His gifts as a lyricist are limited, and his guitar can't sustain a whole album. But the two lead cuts and Selvidge's own ""Frank's Tune"" overcome.

There's no denying the vivacity of Howard Hewett's reconstituted trio--the harmonies and rhythms pop out of the speakers with a brightness of definition that's good for a real lift. But if Hewett has any other interests, he doesn't make them plain--always look again when the standout track comes from contract songwriters. And if Hewett's new sidekicks have any other interests, their solo turns make me hope they keep them out of earshot.

On the ""studio side,"" where the marginal differentiations are nicely tricked up, Jimmy Pursey comes across as a thoughtful eccentric with his own ideas about punk dilemmas both musical and social. Turn the record over and he devolves into a passionate blur of the most faceless English punk sort. Anyone naive enough to structure a song around a repeated shout of ""George Davis Is Innocent"" can be charming for a while, but not for 11:31, which is how long it takes the ""live side"" to self-destruct.

Reports that this product makes it as an album are probably due to the addictive novelty of its rhythmic colors, in which one-man synth army Rob Kilgore surrounds a sweet, yearningly anonymous disco woman with a medium-b.p.m. carillon. But ""Give Me Tonight"" is a surprisingly essential follow-up, and the rest is crafted proportionately. Which is why some let the filler play too.

First line of the last one was ""When I grow up I want to be an old woman,"" first line of this one is ""God is a real estate developer."" Last time she stuck to received country/folk-rock, this time she essays horn arrangements that got lost in the mail. I appreciate the genderfucks (she's hetero here, homo there, and male when you mess with her sister) and could go for a few of the love songs (the long-suffering ""Silent Ways"" in its current incarnation, the long-suffering ""Sleep Keeps Me Awake"" and roving ""On the Greener Side"" gone to heaven). But on the whole this is too arch, too busy, too artistic, too political, succumbing to the overreach that always beckons when you have greatness thrust upon you.

These aging, insulated teen romantics haven't lost their skill at hook construction, but added studio muscle does nothing for their fragile allure. Striving to preserve their male-adolescent prerogatives--""Does he keep you amused between the covers?"" is hardly a teen question--they fail to conquer the distinction between girl trouble, a forgivable adolescent malady, and woman trouble, an offensive adult affliction. Maybe they should try out this Inspirational Verse in the first-person plural: ""She's losing her tested charms/Any little thing seems hard.""

These snappy, hard-hitting songs are what rock and roll used to sound like back when singles were singles and boys would be boys. Except for ""Slip Away""--which I bet provides the melodramatic interlude live--every cut offers its little gift. But producer Lenny Kaye knows as well as anyone that in the halcyon days of top forty real largesse was required--melodies like ""Rendezvous,"" the only potential hit I hear here.

The Gamble-Huff producer-songwriter, whose only major hit as a performer was a Shirley &amp; Lee revival, Phillifies himself honorably--in addition to two or three romps he sings soppy stuff like he wishes he were Smokey Robinson. Unfortunately, only ""Somebody Free"" comes close--closer than the romps do to Shirley &amp; Lee. Which leave the acappella-tinged ""Sweeter Than the Berry"" and the oddly arresting ""Love Train"" (a local) to put the album across.

Once there was a sensitive, conceited young fellow named Jonsi Birgisson who lived on a permafrost island surrounded by a cold, dark sea. Jonsi was a well-meaning person who loved music, and he yearned to put more warmth in the world even though he wasn't exactly sure what warmth was. Not just ""throwing an electric blanket on the corpse of electronica,"" that he knew. Jonsi longed to blaze ""inspired new avenues in sonic landscapes,"" to deliver ""shamelessly tear-stained epics"" in ""the falsetto cadence of angels,"" to turn ""4AD-styled, sepia-toned instrumental passages"" into ""awe-inspiring new-religious mantras."" Stuff like that. He did all this and more on a thematically linked work where some of the sonic landscapes were entrancing (although not warm). Because he was conceited, sometimes he would announce that these soundscapes were destined to change musical history, and then sometimes mean people would make fun of him. But he always had the perfect retort. ""You have to admit I'm smarter than Enya,"" he would say. And about that he was certainly right.

It's her devout hope that we'll ""savor each word like a raspberry,"" and I do mean devout--Sill yearns for the day when Christ the Bridegroom will ""take all the gentle away."" Thank god her music is spiritually unpresumptuous--pythagorean melodies and spare, delicate chamber-folk arrangements that set off her homespun drawl (the lyric sheet favors spellings like ""cuz"" and ""gunna"").

Strange--Simon leaves producer-mentor John Richbourg for Gamble-Huff and all of a sudden he's taking after Jerry Butler. Also strange, especially in an Ice Man, is the way his voice begins to melt when it ventures below the timbreline--how syrupy it gets at the end of ""Something You Can Do Today,"" for instance.

I resented the patina of cheerfulness on There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973) because I thought it sold out the terse, evocative candor of Paul Simon (1972). Now I miss its intimations of universality. I hope in 1977 I'm not moved to praise unduly the small, self-involved ironies that define this record at its best (""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,"" ""You're Kind"") without alleviating its lugubriousness (""Night Game,"" ""Silent Eyes""). P.S. As you probably know, Art Garfunkel is back for one number. As you may not have noticed, Simon takes this as a cue to revert to the sophomoricism of ""Richard Cory"" and ""The Sound of Silence""--""a finger on the trigger of a gun"" indeed.

The best Warners stuff is all from Graceland and wants to go home, and though the music is fine if you like such stuff, this is the kind of consumer manipulation that merits a boycott.

Where the two covers carried the debut, they drag the follow-up. But Mick Hucknall's originals are improving, and their guileless self-interest has its advantages--""I Won't Feel Bad,"" about his right to make pots of money because he's not the power elite, and ""Infidelity,"" about his right to fuck around because it's his right, are more convincing for their refusal to shilly-shally. They're also more convincing because Hucknall's an inherently convincing singer. All this is relative to the Anglopop norm, however. Better hot narcissism than cool narcissism, and better soul acolytes than Bowie clones. But not that much better.

The first side is just Sahm country and though I could do without the pedal steel I like it fine--""Cowboy Peyton Place"" and ""Texas Ranger Man"" are genre songs at their overstated best. The second side is redneck hoohah and I found it easier to take him seriously as a hippie, maybe because I'm more hippie than redneck myself--""Country Groove"" and ""Floatway"" and of course ""You Can't Hide a Redneck (Under That Hippy Hair)"" sound written to order, and if they did the hustle in Austin I'm sure he'd have added one of those (which might be more fun).

While pioneering funk groups like Funkadelic and the Commodores, manned by veteran musicians, clearly evolved out of existing black-music formats, the younger ones often resemble third-generation rock groups in concept and spirit. Unless you prefer Kansas to the J.B.'s, this is not a compliment; profound thoughts like ""Now will always be forever"" might well grace the back of a Starcastle album. This is a Starcastle kind of band, too, right down to its general derivativeness and pretensions to content. But it doesn't make Starcastle music. Despite moderate tempos, the first side of the band's third and best LP chugs by smartly without once pausing to pose--it's fun, and it's interesting, too. Lesson: if the play of rhythms, textures, studio tricks, and vocal techniques constitutes the real content of your music, black is as beautiful as ever.

This really is Sly's best since Fresh, but the title does give it away, because Sly isn't going to progress by trying to recapture the past. Fresh was a great finale because it gathered five years of energy and innovation into an almost autumnal synthesis. There are cuts here--""The Same Thing,"" ""Shine It On""--that might fit into that synthesis. But there aren't any that could define it, much less suggest a new one.

I called Back on the Right Track his best since Fresh in 1979, and for what that's worth it was, and this may even be a little better--the aphoristic snap of the songwriting recalls better days, and the mix generates some heat. But where in 1979 it seemed theoretically possible that Sly was on some track or other, there's no way this'll pull him through--often sounds as if he's not even there. Which he wasn't when Stewart Levine finally converted the tracks he'd laid down in 1980 into 1983 product. What a waste.

TO GET LAID!"" So it grieves me to report that only rarely do Bart Lewis's glam-metal riffs live up to such Sally Cato lines as ""You play the fool and I play the tart"" or ""It's a filthy lie but someone's gotta live it.""

Having conquered my wimpophobia to where I reflexively enjoy the supple smarts of their sound, I bore down anticipating even tastier goodies, and now I must face facts. In three of these songs somebody's dead or dying, in three more somebody contemplates murder, and in the rest somebody's in a selfish pet of the sort that led to the aforementioned threats. So the liveliest tracks are where somebody's dead or dying: AIDS song, biz song, song about how selfish and petty you feel when somebody you've raged at actually dies.

Although the rumors of a major new artist that began after the success of ""Poetry Man""--still her sappiest song, although the lyrics here aren't what they call creative writing--originated with fuzzy-minded mongers, I'm pleased to report that her trademark melismatic quaver hasn't degenerated into a gimmick, and I acknowledge that this is a good record of its type. I just have my doubts about how good a jazz-folk mood-music record can be. Money isn't all that's ""worthless/When your music's mirthless""--sometimes the music is as well.

By now Snow projects a jazz singer's assurance, and though the originals are still overshadowed by the covers I'd like to hear Tammy Wynette try ""Majesty of Life,"" about ""what can happen to a girl in her hometown.""

Robert Wyatt's light touch imbues these pleasant experiments with their own unique pulse, but only because the music is labeled rock is it hailed as a breakthrough. It does qualify as a change of pace--on the group's last album three musicians put seventeen titles on two sides, while on this one eight musicians put four on four. But though Mike Ratledge's ""Out-Bloody-Rageous,"" to choose the most interesting example, brings together convincing approximations of Terry Riley-style modular pianistics and John Coltrane-style modal sax (Hugh Hopper has Jimmy Garrison's bass down perfect), Riley and Coltrane do it better. Only Wyatt's ""Moon in June"" is eccentric by the standards of its influences--which must be why it's hard to name them all.

Having dropped the trance-music distensions for theme-and-variation arrangements (long on the arrangement and short on the variation though they may be), does the band still call this ""rock""? It's English jazz, that's all--neither as flawed as you'd fear nor as muscular as its American counterparts. Non-composing saxophonist Elton Dean is the dominant voice, as saxophonists tend to be. He's adequate or better at free blowing, no mean accomplishment, but he's also a little thin in the embouchure, as English saxophonists tend to be.

The shortfall of this uprooted state-of-Mainer is generic. Like so many underground rappers, he's actually what his meaner and cheerier coequal Busdriver calls, less sarcastically than he thinks, a ""spoken-word artist."" He writes poetry designed for declamation. ""Never learned to dance because I exercise the right to write,"" so his beats are his rhymes and meters, and his scant music more atmosphere than rhythm. From a fringe foreseen by William Gibson, sharing cheap food and living quarters with fellow spirits he doesn't entirely trust if he can stand them at all, he speaks for a disenfranchised subculture that knows, as he says in his best line, ""jobs ain't nothing but free pens and long distance calls."" Certainly he understands things about this society that his better-adjusted contemporaries don't. But he's woefully short on not just empathy but humorous self-deprecation. With him, ""I only rap because I ain't smart enough to write a book"" is a species of boast. And when he does write a book, which he will, no one will read it.

They're sure to disagree--what else are they good for?--but despite all their apocalyptic integrity and unmediated whoziwhatsis, the achievement of their first halfway decent record is strictly formal: simple, rhythmic songs that neither disappear beneath nor get the better of the clanging and grinding of their brutal late-industrial guitars. Whatever credibility the guitars lend to their no doubt painful but nonetheless hackneyed manic depression is undermined by their usual sociopathic fantasies, and in the end the music isn't ugly or ominous or bombs bursting midair. It's just interesting.

The music isn't overtly political, just good, which ought to be what it comes down to: simple, plaintive, midtempo rock dominated by singer-composer-guitarist Doug Yankus. Actually, Yankus is a guitarist first--his playing dominates both the serviceable songs on one side and the blues-evolving-into-jazz jam on the other, and it sure beats Richie Furay or Carmine Appice.

Except for some better than average original songs, this is white r&amp;b at its most pleasant, tasteful, and respectable--quite enjoyable, quite unextraordinary, and thank you honored guests.
"
FALSE,B,Introducing Sparks,Sparks,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7823,"
On its five albums for Bearsville and Island, this skillful brother act compounded personal hatefulness with a deliberately tense and uninviting take on pop-rock. But with their Columbia debut, Big Beat, they began to loosen up, and here one cut actually makes surf music history, in the tending-to-hyperconsciousness section. This is tuneful, funny, even open. But the fear of women and the stubborn, spoiled-teenager cynicism is still there, and it's still hateful.
"
FALSE,B,Youngest in Charge,Special Ed,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6186,"
With the 16-year-old rhyming quick as he can think over Howie Tee's tenacious samples, this starts off flying--nine ""ax""es in 13 seconds clim""ax"" ""I'm Taxin,'"" with sense no barrier. But thematically it's the usual, and as Howie downshifts and Ed pulls out his skeezer number (""I hate cheap sex,"" he warned us, neglecting to add ""after it's over"" and ""unless I'm selling it""), you wish he'd grow up, fresh or no fresh.
"
FALSE,B,More Specials,The Specials,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8417,"
This time they make the ska sound their own by synthesizing its trippy beat and their own inborn vocal attenuation into a single formal principle--a platonic ideal of fun. Especially on side two, the result is so light it's almost ethereal, political consciousness and all.
"
FALSE,B,New and Improved,Spinners,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7827,"
The slow side is Dionne Warwicke in flight plus filler. The fast side is Phillipe Wynne (sp?) in flight plus good filler (good 'cause he keeps flying). The prizes are ""Sadie,"" a mom song that should have broken pop, and ""Then Came You,"" a love song that did.
"
FALSE,B,"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow",Spinners,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7830,"
The first side would be their most featureless since they joined Thom Bell if it weren't for the asinine ""Me and My Music,"" which I regret to report is catchy enough for a single. But the second is their most listenable since Pick of the Litter. Philippe Wynn (oh, the hell with it) walks away with an eight-minute fast one on top of an eight-minute slow one, but it's a disco-flavored showpiece, produced by Thom's brother Tony and featuring ringer singer John Edwards, that gets things going. Purists fear the worst from Tony's groove, and they may be right, but ""Honey, I'm in Love With You"" ain't it. Edwards sounds a little like Al Green, which of course has nothing to do with my enthusiasm.
"
FALSE,B,The Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus,Spirit,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7834,"
Both Randy California and the band have their own cool, rich, jazzy style--a genuine achievement, but that doesn't mean you have to like it. They play better than they write, and since they still play songs, that's a problem. A worse problem is that the lyrics are rarely as cerebral as the music. ""Nature's Way,"" for instance, sounds as if it ought to be sardonicus, but though I'm intrigued by the suggestion that it's about death I still think it's a slightly inarticulate ecology song. Could be covered by Peter, Paul &amp; Mary--who also have their own style.
"
FALSE,B,Spot 1019,Spot 1019,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8424,"
Some Camper Van fans will suck up the only other band on their heroes' indie vanity label, but the true faithful won't believe. All together now, children, in your best Valley-boy-turned-surf-punk accents: ""They're just an imi-tay-shun."" Actually, without the (tongue-in-cheek) psychedelic utopianism and (closet) one-worlder rhythms, they're much more the college dropout humor magazine. Get off their share of snotty-to-spacy jokes, too.
"
FALSE,B,Cameo,Dusty Springfield,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7842,"
Offensive as I find the notion of a ""girl singer"" in this year of our enlightenment, something about this thirty-four-year-old woman demands the term, because her genius is to make me believe, down beneath my rational self, that she needs me. Simultaneously gushy and ladylike, she sings like the beautiful maidservant of men's vainest and most shameful fantasies--always the supplicant, always in love. Yet at the same time she manages to elicit sisterly sympathy from other women. Lambert and Potter have mixed the orchestra way too high on this record, but for these guys, who usually write banal melodies that stick so stubbornly you hate them for it, the tunes are complex and likable. Maybe that's because L&amp;P adjusted them for a tough human being who convinced them mid-session that she wasn't just some backup chick doing a solo spot. Recommended: ""Of All the Things,"" ""The Other Side of Life.""
"
FALSE,B,It Begins Again,Dusty Springfield,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7843,"
Roy Thomas Baker has encouraged Dusty's breathiness and then had the good manners not to suffocate it in the orchestral mix, and I'm grateful; I could listen to her sing tracking charts when she exhales that way. But the sad truth is that Baker has given her only a couple of strong ballads, the fluky treasures from Chi Coltrane and Barry Manilow that open each side, and so the fast numbers, never her forte, sound like filler. Next time, Baker should look beyond the pop pros for material like, say, ""Small Town Talk,"" ""Makin' Love Don't Always Make Love Grow,"" ""I Can't Stand the Rain."" And he should make sure there's a next time.
"
FALSE,B,We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions,Bruce Springsteen,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13306,"
We shall overkill, he means. Never have his Howard Keel tendencies, or maybe now they're Paul Robeson tendencies, tripped him up so bad. The idea is to big up the music and play the jokes you don't ignore like you're working a Roman amphitheater. I'm glad to have met the anti-war lament ""Mrs. McGrath"" and Sis Cunningham's ""My Oklahoma Home,"" and sort of hope young people deprived of music appreciation funding will now hear ""Erie Canal,"" ""Froggie Went A-Courtin',"" ""John Henry,"" and ""Jesse James."" Only are young people really ignorant of these songs? And how many of them buy Springsteen albums anyway? Amping up his strange bluegrass-Dixieland hybrid like E Street is just around the corner, he sings his lungs out. But in folk music, lightness is all--and only newbies and John Hammond Jr. lean so hard on the cornpone drawl.
"
FALSE,B,Cool for Cats,Squeeze,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7847,"
Power poppers (remember them?) suck this stuff up, and I understand why--not only does its songcraft surpass that of the band's debut, but it also isn't quite as sophomoric. It's sophomoric enough, though, and like so many such records makes you wonder where the power is. Not in the vision, that's for sure. And not in the beat. Great song: ""Up the Junction.""
"
FALSE,B,It's Alright,Chris Stamey,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8429,"
After two excessively eccentric solo LPs, Stamey's new wave supersession is excessively conventional, subsuming his mad pop perfectionism and repressed inner turmoil in mere well-madeness. Under the leader's iron thumb, Fier, Lloyd, Easter, Worrell, and the pack push all the right buttons, even the one marked Liftoff, thus transporting those who've been waiting five years for their hero to take them for a ride.
"
FALSE,B,The Finer Things in Life,Chuck Stanley,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8430,"
The tender heart palpitating beneath Public Enemy's hard-boiled exterior, Stanley is out of Oran Jones's league. His juicy baritone rises easily to a rich falsetto, and Luther or Freddie would pay cold money for either. But the range of his instrument becomes an end in itself--he never projects Luther's personal intensity or even Freddie's personal style. And while he's not yet a big enough love man to bore the world by controlling his own publishing, the soft fantasies of the hard-boiled do have their runny tendencies.
"
FALSE,B,Time Waits for No One,Mavis Staples,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6209,"
This dream meeting between the criminally underexploited black singer and the black-pop capo doesn't flop altogether--both principals can generate a certain minimum interest sleepwalking. The two songs composed by old Stax hands are slightly embarrassing, but they sound like Mavis, who's made meaningful schlock her lifework. The six by Prince sound like a top-of-the-line disco producer who can't say no to a great voice or a deep ballad.
"
FALSE,B,The Staple Swingers,Staple Singers,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7851,"
Don't be put off by the title. The Staples haven't been a gospel group for years, and now that they're admitting it they can build a credible pop-soul sound on their two extraordinary assets--Mavis's urgent voice and Pop's laggard lick. This has its clumsy moments, but it also has its transcendent one: ""Heavy Makes You Happy,"" a hit single from the same pen that gave us ""Sugar Sugar."" And Smokey Robinson provides moral suasion.
"
FALSE,B,Be What You Are,Staple Singers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7853,"
This is a pleasing, consistent album--no gaffes. But no gifts either, unless you count Bettye Crutcher's apparently literal ""Drown Yourself,"" which provides relief from a charity that's all too unremitting. In truth, the music sometimes seems a little unremitting too--bet I'd like both hit songs just as much if they didn't clock in at 5:01 and 4:27 on LP.
"
FALSE,B,Unlock Your Mind,Staple Singers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7857,"
For producer Jerry Wexler, this was obviously a labor of love. For the Staples likewise. Respects itself, you might say. But whether the problem is the songs or the way Mavis relates to them, only one cut, ""Handwriting on the Wall,"" would stand tall on their Stax best-of.
"
FALSE,B,Turning Point,Staple Singers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8431,"
This is indeed a spiritual return to their commercial heyday on Stax a decade-plus ago, which for those who don't remember was sometimes clumsily (sometimes even comically) uneven in tone and achievement. ""That's What Friends Are For"" is a sermon that'll keep you awake, but ""Bridges Instead of Walls"" would tempt the marginally pious to play pocket pool or peruse the weekly bulletin. And Mavis is more convincing as David Byrne than as Millie Jackson.
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Edwin Starr,Edwin Starr,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8433,"
He's more exciting at his best--check out the five tracks on Volume 3 of the Motown's Preferred Stock series, if you can find it and don't wear a pacemaker--but one reason he suits the disco format better than, for instance, Johnnie Taylor, is that he isn't as good as Johnnie Taylor. That is, his excitement inheres mostly in his formula. Just as you expected, the formula here isn't up to full-speed Motown like ""Agent Double-O Soul,"" ""War,"" or (the here reprised) ""25 Miles,"" though ""Accident"" comes close. Not only that--to salve his conscience they let him have some full-length ballads.
"
FALSE,B,Beaucoups of Blues,Ringo Starr,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7862,"
Finally he gets to impersonate Buck Owens for an entire record. I admit that over the distance he doesn't merely sing flat--sometimes the voice threatens to fade away altogether. But both the songs and Pete Drake's production bespeak a high-quality obsession--the music sticks. And Ringo is still Ringo, which means he's good at making himself felt.
"
FALSE,B,Stealers Wheel,Stealers Wheel,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7870,"
Skeptics said: ""Producers' group."" I disagreed, because Leiber &amp; Stoller have done nothing but sit on their genius for almost a decade, and because half of this duo had a promising pre-history as half of the eccentric English-folk-rockish Humblebums. Anyway, almost every song on the album sounded substantial--until I really listened, whereupon most of them sounded, well, let's say thoughtful. Conclusion: at the very least, the kind of group producers like.
"
FALSE,B,Handsworth Revolution,Steel Pulse,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3305,"
A promising debut from the first (black) English reggae group, and I bet there'll be others. The ideology is Rastafarian, but its mood is less steamy--as cool-headed as herb permits, and righteously angry. Now let's hope the music, which is distinctive but not all the way there yet, catches up with the words.
"
FALSE,B,True Democracy,Steel Pulse,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8436,"
One reason I've liked them is that they've always steered clear of Rasta misogyny, but not now--would they call out a man who ""says carnal love is a must""? Other reasons have included groove, politics, and hooks--groove alone won't do. Best politics: ""A Who's Responsible?"" and ""Worth His Weight in Gold."" Best hooks: ""A Who's Responsible?"" and ""Worth His Weight in Gold.""
"
FALSE,B,The Royal Scam,Steely Dan,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3314,"
The first question is whether the melodic retreat represents a refusal to indulge the audience or a withering of invention. The second is whether the conscious choice of a jagged, pinched music is a wise one. As if in compensation, the lyrics are less involuted and personal, but in fact their objectivity intensifies Steely Dan's natural nastiness. Whether this narrowing of spiritual possibilities is willed or a symptom of the same chronic insularity that makes Fagen and Becker unwilling to tour, the result sounds a trifle arty and a trifle producty at the same time. Does it matter whether they call San Juan ""the city of St. John"" in reference to the apocalypse or because it scans nice?
"
FALSE,B,Dots and Loops,Stereolab,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3323,"
From folkie soprano to synthesizer tweedle, many young people are down with their validation of high and clean--""Let There Be Flutes,"" as Bentley Rhythm Ace put it. And on a pretty good track, too, just like Emperor Tomato Ketchup is a fine album. Where us down and dirty types say sayonara is after the high artist peaks. Exploring rather than apotheosizing personal secrets, the high artist is like any other formalist, especially since he, she, or they probably suffered from formalist tendencies to begin with. On this album the tunes fall off and the wacky smarts lose the charm of surprise. There's still plenty of agile bass and clever sonic garbage. But only the high and clean will notice.
"
FALSE,B,Steppin' Out,Gary Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1347,"
""Well-produced"" for sure, more country and more rock and roll all at the same time. But it sounds as if the craziness has been rationalized right out of him.
"
FALSE,B,Little Junior,Gary Stewart,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7885,"
This is a likable album because Stewart is a likable artist, secure by now in his good-humored bad-old-boy persona. But only once--on a version of Ry Cooder's ""I Got Mine"" that ranks with the greatest Jerry Reed novelties--does he give that persona a shot in the arm.
"
FALSE,B,Brand New,Gary Stewart,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1350,"
Hard living deepens great voices, but it's hell on the smaller ones, and so naturally Stewart compensates by oversinging, burying the songs in a mannered misery and wild-ass desperation that for all you can tell he may actually be feeling. Wordplay's half there at best: ""I was born the life of the party/And honey I'm dyin' tryin' to get one started,"" which is terrific, is preceded by ""I was born the son of a honky tonk woman/My daddy was a natural-born gamblin' man,"" which is terrible. And which provides the song's title.
"
FALSE,B,A Night on the Town,Rod Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7892,"
This is Stewart's most ambitious record since Never a Dull Moment four years ago, but its ambitions are only partly fulfilled. If he's gonna start doing big message numbers, he'd better rise above the pathetic liberalism of ""Tradewinds,"" the most overblown song he's ever recorded 'cept maybe for the symphonic version of ""Pinball Wizard."" And if he's gonna break new ground thematically, as on the ""gay"" ""Killing of Georgie,"" he'd better come up with slightly less Dylanesque melodies--in the course of comparing Stewart's song with its fraternal twin, ""Simple Twist of Fate,"" I was reminded of just how precise an arrangement can be.
"
FALSE,B,Blondes Have More Fun,Rod Stewart,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7895,"
He used to mean to be meaningful and now he means to be trashy, but that doesn't make him decadent. Decadent is when Carol Bayer Sager writes all your songs for you.
"
FALSE,B,Tonight I'm Yours,Rod Stewart,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8444,"
This is not only a comeback but a speedup--comes on like he thinks Depeche Mode is the next Vanilla Fudge. These days the ""Mandolin Wind"" man only sounds genuinely sensitive when his ego's threatened--on the cuckolded ""How Long,"" not the icky-inspirational ""Never Give Up on a Dream."" And he's most convincing when he sounds really mad, on the cuckolded ""Jealous.""
"
FALSE,B,Long May You Run,The Stills Young Band,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2518,"
Like the tour, the album (recorded in Miami, where many of the songs take place) is a profit-taking throwaway, but that's not necessarily a bad thing--Young is always wise to wing it, and the less Stills expresses himself the better. Also, there's an expotential advantage in hearing Steve sing lead only every other cut. His ""Make Love to You"" (""you're such a lady"") does inspire ""Midnight on the Bay,"" Neil's stupidest song in many a moon. But most of the time Neil's in a droll mood--title song's a riot. Not bad for California rock.
"
FALSE,B,. . . Nothing Like the Sun,Sting,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8447,"
He's more relaxed this time, because he's gotten to know his band or maybe just because he's got to less to prove, but except on the lovingly funky ""We'll Be Together,"" no doubt a sop to the market, you're not going to catch him having fun. That would entail his getting out of himself, and from the jazzy insouciance of his Noah sendup to the aching compassion of his tribute to the mothers of the Chilean slain, the focus is always on the man singing. Pretentious, this is called, and no matter how humane your intentions it buries your subject matter in ego.
"
FALSE,B,Stories,Stories,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7907,"
The Left Banke, Mike Brown's long-ago previous group, seem a little prissy in retrospect, but they were sweet at the time, no? Well, this may seem prissy some day, too, but it'll never seem sweet--too intense. And if the other songs had the melodic sinew of ""St. James"" and ""Step Back"" it might seem quite strong now.
"
FALSE,B,Fantasy Rag,Stormin' Norman & Suzy,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7909,"
This might just be another good-time band dedicated to the proposition that scuzz is cute if it weren't for Suzy Williams's natural echo, which calls up images of riverboats and cathouse pianos despite the thin recording. Unfortunately, Norman Zamcheck's voice calls up images of an account executive fulfilling his inner nature, and while his songs really are fantasy rags--""Wealthy Philanthropist,"" for example, is a piquant piece of '20s camp--he captures Suzy perfectly only twice. The titles suggest her emotional range: ""Rise, Angel"" and ""Crazy Lady.""
"
FALSE,B,Ocean of Love,Stormin' Norman & Suzy,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7910,"
If anything, this intelligent major-label debut is a half-step down. There are no disabling gaffes, and in theory it's good for Suzy to sing more and Norman less; her big, sad, cheerful voice sounds more like itself, too. But despite the ocean noises and ""The Gallant Balloonist"" and a coda that goes ""socked right in the kisser--right in the eye,"" this is definitely an attempt at de-zanification. And what the world needs from Suzy Williams is not another chick--oops, woman, forgot about ""You Keep Me Cryin'""--singer. It's Suzy.
"
FALSE,B,"Greatest Hits, Volume Two",George Strait,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1388,"
The lackluster professionalism seems like the fulfillment of his always modest gifts and ambitions, with Something Special a blip. Not counting ""The Chair,"" which is on both records, there are five songs on that album that top anything besides ""All My Ex's Live in Texas"" on this one. ""You're Something Special to Me,"" which is also on both records, isn't among them. Instead it exemplifies the factory-certified hookiness of his current singles strategy, though its plain sentimentality is a little extreme--better the mild overstatement of ""Ocean Front Property"" or even the mild whoop-de-do of ""The Fireman."" No tuneouts, that's the ticket. Just blandouts.
"
FALSE,B,Surprise,Syd Straw,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5964,"
Fitting roots tastes to theatrical background, she connects song by song, eventually--lost dB's hit, riddle-me-rhyme, futurist nostalgia. But nowadays the smoothest singer-songwriter effort sounds mannered, and smooth this ain't: recorded in NYC, Woodstock, London, L.A., Austin, San Marcos, and Brian Eno's house with 37 musicians (no horns, no strings, 13 fairly famous guitarists), the album creaks with intelligence. Don't judge her by her claque. But don't believe her claque either.
"
FALSE,B,Mel Street's Greatest Hits,Mel Street,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7913,"
Street is sincere and rather modest; he keeps the music basic and never tries to overpower anyone with his personable baritone or unexaggerated drawl. But he sure does have a weakness for illicit love, and he ought to face up--referring to the objects of one's lust (a term he specifically disavows) as angels (in three out of ten song titles) will not fool the Lord.
"
FALSE,B,Red Card,Streetwalkers,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7915,"
In a time of hard rock drought, this will do--the tempos are up, and such songs as ""Run for Cover"" and ""Roll Up, Roll Up"" and ""Decadence Code"" suggest that they're observing our famous wasteland as well as experiencing it. Ominoso with a vengeance.
"
FALSE,B,String Driven Thing,String Driven Thing,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3364,"
This English quartet features a violinist, but stay where you are--no resemblance to Ian Anderson or David LaFlamme. Well, maybe a little--I could do without the mytholyric ""Jack Diamond"" and find the beat stiff at times. Still, they have one, not bad for a group driven by an electric bass and such ordinary peripheral percussion devices as congas and tambourines. In fact, they get pretty wild, with the violin exploited for dementia. Yet the lyrics are sane an dwell-observed. In my favorite, God doesn't play in a rock and roll band.
"
FALSE,B,Introducing the Style Council,The Style Council,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8454,"
A rather lengthy ""mini-LP"" continues the strange and touching saga of Paul Weller, who gave up the Jam because fronting Britain's best-loved band had turned into a superstar routine. Here he records relaxed lounge-soul tunes with a keyb-playing partner and as with the Jam's rock tunes it's unclear to a mere Yank what the big deal is. Weller's unabashed working-class leftism is a treasure, and his charm is undeniable at any distance. But there has to be undeniable music in here somewhere as well. Doesn't there?
"
FALSE,B,The Singular Adventures of the Style Council,The Style Council,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8456,"
Because I thought it was my problem that I'd never listened hard after Internationalists, I put heavy time into these hits, if that's what they really were. And slowly it began to dawn on me that maybe Paul Weller's motives for disbanding the Jam weren't all that pure--that he knew damn well pop smoothies were taking over from guitar bands. Tuneful, sometimes memorable, and often far from stupid, this Eurowise white funk comes from the same place musically as Culture Club and George Michael. Only it's not quite as good.
"
FALSE,B,8th Wonder,Sugarhill Gang,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8458,"
Although the Gang harmonize professionally enough to make you wonder what their gig was before they discovered talking, professional is as good as they get, and in the absence of vaguely interesting words the singing tracks are funktional dance music at best. The rap words aren't any more meaningful (this group never had better material than on its first, worst, and biggest single), but their rhythmic significance makes that irrelevant. You've heard of talking drums? Rappers are walking talking drums.
"
FALSE,B,A Love Trilogy,Donna Summer,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7928,"
This is marred by new what's-going-on-in-the-next-apartment distractions; again and again. Donna bids the object of her affections ""come . . . come . . . come"" before adding ""to my arms,"" so that when she cries out ""don't let go"" you have to wonder of what. But it does boast two otherwise uninterrupted sides of baroque German disco fluff and proves that she can carry a tune as well as a torch. I can even imagine playing it at a party.
"
FALSE,B,Cats Without Claws,Donna Summer,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1071,"
The mildly compelling steady-hooks-all-in-a-row construction suggests that Michael Omartian knows his Ric Ocasek, and it will do just fine for those who get a glow just hearing her rare back and sing. But what made the last album was two undeniably singular singles. This time she leads with a cover. Which Ben E. King rared back and sang better a quarter-century ago.
"
FALSE,B,Swampwater,Swampwater,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7940,"
On their own Linda Ronstadt's backup boys prove honest country-rockers, which is like (and probably is) honest folkies with more chops. Very tuneful in a variety of styles, with Gib Guilbeau's fiddle pushing toward the bayous and John Beland's guitar pulling 'em back to L.A. But their best lyric is about a dancing bear, and their version of ""Headed for the country"" is less bathetic than Johnny Darrell's only because they couldn't project big emotions if they wanted to.
"
FALSE,B,Make It Last Forever,Keith Sweat,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8462,"
For credentials the next big love man proffers beats on the slow ones and lyrics whose seduction strategy is never to offend. The lyrics don't define either, which is no surprise, just the usual disappointment; the beats prove Teddy Riley New York's answer to Jam &amp; Lewis. So the fast ones are fine. They're also outnumbered.
"
FALSE,B,Sweet Thursday,Sweet Thursday,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11071,"
An honest, listenable record from an English group which may well never make another. Nicky Hopkins appears on all cuts and is at his best.
"
FALSE,B,Pillow Talk,Sylvia,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7952,"
Let's Get It On without production values. Call it underdeveloped if you want; I'll mention that it's unaffected. Including the best peace lyric heard lately, entitled ""Had Any Lately?""
"
FALSE,B,Music World,Jamaaladeen Tacuma,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8470,"
First side's my kind of new age, a kitschy travelogue laid down with local fusioneers in Tokyo, Paris, Istanbul. Second side journeys from New York to Philadelphia, and let me tell you--both ""The Creator Has a Master Plan"" and ""One More Night"" have sounded more at home elsewhere.
"
FALSE,B,True Stories,Talking Heads,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3407,"
These songs were conceived for a movie, rarely an efficient way to initiate an aural experience. Yet they're real songs, not detached avant-garde atmospherics, and honest though David Byrne's sympathy may (I said may) be, they leach their vitality from traditions that demand more heart than he ordinarily coughs up. Interesting they remain. But no way the rhetorical gris-gris of ""Papa Legba"" or the evangelical paranoia of ""Puzzlin' Evidence"" or (God knows) the escapist solace of ""Dream Operator"" is gonna fascinate like ""Crosseyed and Painless"" or ""Slippery People""--for one thing, Byrne lets us know what the new songs mean, which ain't much. Do they rock, you want to know? Oh yes they do.

FALSE,B,Howard Tate's Reaction,Howard Tate,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7958,"
Born in Macon and resident in Philadelphia, Tate is a truly underground soul singer whose few small late-'60s hits (collected on one superb Verve LP) have earned him a rep among cognoscenti as diverse as Mike Bloomfield and Mark Farner. This album, produced by underground schlock-soul singers Lloyd Price and Johnny Nash in Jamaica, is based on even smaller hits. One of them, ""These Are the Things That Make Me Know You're Gone"" (""refrigerator left ajar,"" like that), dishonors his rep. But ""My Soul's Got a Hole in It"" doesn't, and Tate's voice is potent enough to activate more inert material. Cognoscenti will dig.
"
FALSE,B,Silent Tongues,Cecil Taylor,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11276,"
Since I recommend Taylor's appearances so extravagantly, it's only fair to note that there is a natural theater to his live performance that I miss on record--observing his concentration greatly increases my own. Especially solo, he's too abstract for a rock and roller to follow, although I love his Monkish early group sessions, recently reissued on a Blue Note twofer called In Transition. Even more than usual, take my grade as a measure of personal usefulness rather than aesthetic merit.
"
FALSE,B,JT,James Taylor,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7968,"
James sounds both awake--worth a headline in itself--and in touch; maybe CBS gave him a clock radio for opening an account there. ""Handy Man"" is a transcendent sex ballad, while ""I Was Only Telling a Lie"" and ""Secret o' Life"" evoke comparison with betters on the order of the Stones and Randy Newman, so that the wimpy stuff--which still predominates--sounds merely laid-back in contrast. Best since Sweet Baby James, shit--some of this is so wry and lively and committed his real fans may find it obtrusive.
"
FALSE,B,Rare Stamps,Johnnie Taylor,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11541,"
I'm not normally a big Taylor fan, but this is a semi-greatest hits record that eliminates a lot of dross.
"
FALSE,B,Super Taylor,Johnnie Taylor,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7972,"
Last time the best cuts took a while despite their hit history, which means you never got to the others without working at it. Here ""It's September"" (a you're-due-home lyric finished off with a sharp question mark of a guitar riff) and ""I've Been Born Again"" (testifying so ebulliently for fidelity that it sounds like both fun and the truth) have seduced me into listening to both sides again and again. And you know, they're pretty good.
"
FALSE,B,Basic Soul,Koko Taylor,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7976,"
Apparently, what basic soul means to Willie Dixon is basic blues--the music is in the traditional Chicago style, as it should be. But the songs have lost additional wang dang doodle--the standout is ""Violent Love,"" in which Willie and Koko try their hand at camp and don't get bitten.
"
FALSE,B,Kilimanjaro,The Teardrop Explodes,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8476,"
If Bunnyman Ian McCulloch favors the schlock mysterioso Jim Morrison, Droplet Julian Cope prefers the schlock heartthrob, complete with romantic authoritarianism (""Well I don't think this is real/To criticize our love"" is prime hippie bullshit, no?), ""Touch Me"" horns, and AM potential. No, really, ""Sleeping Gas"" was once a very poppy indie single, and some of this stuff would probably sound pretty neat on the, er, radio is what we used to call it I guess. But why anyone who didn't acquire an addiction that way would prefer this to Blondie or the Box Tops is beyond me. I mean, Cope is a little smarter than Jay Black or Gary Lewis, but that just makes him harder to take.
"
FALSE,B,Songs from the Big Chair,Tears for Fears,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8477,"
Never one to pay much mind to the plaints of English lads with synthesizers, I got duly annoyed at the surface and let it go at that. Imagine my surprise when I discerned substance underneath--uncommon command of guitar and piano, Baker Street sax, synthesizers more jagged than is deemed mete by the arbiters of dance-pop accessibility. Even found a lyric that went ""We are paid by those who live by our mistakes,"" not bad at all. Yet in the end the surface is still annoying--not so much pretentious as portentous, promising a depth and drama English lads have been falling short on since the dawn of progressive rock.
"
FALSE,B,Looney Tunes,Telex,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6061,"
These disco-mad Belgian technopoppers take off like a computer run amuck. By the time they're through with the lovable ""I Don't Like Music"" and the ducky ""Temporary Chicken,"" they could be the Art of Noise doing a comedy album, or Tom Tom Club on a roll--they've earned the right to call one ""Spike Jones."" But despite the ""Frere Jacques"" and ""Jingle Bells"" rips to follow, ""Spike Jones"" is as crazy as side one gets. And despite ""I Want Your Brain,"" side two is technodisco.

FALSE,B,Jack Tempchin,Jack Tempchin,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7980,"
In which the successful L.A. songwriter and former (putative) Funky King becomes a Schmeagle for our time--in the course of four terrific songs he loses his keys, misplaces his car, doesn't get laid, and spends fifteen days under the hood. That's the trick, Jack--tell enough jokes on yourself and your self-pity becomes tolerable.
"
FALSE,B,Psychedelic Shack,The Temptations,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7981,"
It's no accident that the best cut here begins ""Ain't no words to this song."" For all the hyperactivity of his horn charts, Norman Whitfield is a lot better equipped to get funky than to lead Motown's belated raid on ""relevance,"" and many of these lyrics are dreadful. Several of them are quite all right, though, and ""War"" does help mitigate the climactic wishy-wash of ""Friendship Train."" More to the point, the singing and playing really do fuse the production styles of Smokey and Sly, a major achievement. Why do white people challenge these songs so much quicker than they did ""Lucy in the Sky"" or ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun""? Are friendship trains any dumber than bed-ins?
"
FALSE,B,Sky's the Limit,The Temptations,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7983,"
Greater even than ""Just My Imagination"" is ""Smiling Faces Sometimes,"" in which for twelve minutes Norman Whitfield's spacey string and sound effects combine with a rhythm track that might as well be looped to transform Eddie Kendricks's soft lead into the rap of a paranoid soothsayer. But on the flip Whitfield funks up James Bond horns for nine horrible minutes and finds a Swahili title for an offensively defensive brotherhood appeal.
"
FALSE,B,Sheet Music,10cc,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2,"
Points for studio mastery and general literacy--""Oh Effendi,"" about the vicissitudes of Middle Eastern trade, is Cole Porter-ishly clever--but demerits for a detachment that might seem pathological if it weren't so damned expert. Great satire communicates a feeling--most often hatred or anguish, although it can be kinder, as in ""The Dean and I"" on 10cc--that is lacking from this too-too apollonian (cerebral? professional? glib?) endeavor. Though if the feeling itself is absent, a good beat will sometimes suffice in its stead.
"
FALSE,B,Construction No. 1,Ten Wheel Drive,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11055,"
I don't much approve of jazz-rock, and Genya Raven, this group's resident Janis Joplin, can get a little too harsh and samey at times, but this is so superior to anything (arghh) Lighthouse or (polite belch) Blood, Sweat, and Tears have done that I feel obliged to kind-of recommend it. I wish I believed their live performance shows as much taste, but I'm not making any bets.
"
FALSE,B,Sssh,Ten Years After,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10890,"
I should like this record, by a group I have always admired, more than I do. It has a lot of nice original fake blues songs and Alvin Lee's usual distinction on vocals and guitar. But in fact I never listen to it.
"
FALSE,B,Rock & Roll Music to the World,Ten Years After,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7995,"
I remember when this was a promising group--that Alvin Lee, he sure could sing and play, and those other guys sure did get it together behind him. But in four years and then some, all they've accomplished is to get it together some more. As unslick as ever, they're nevertheless a lot tighter in the commercial sense, and the speed and brevity of such cuts as ""Choo Choo Mama"" exemplify Alvin Lee's rockabilly approach to blues. On his own terms, this is mature, impressive work. But I suspect that the next time I feel like hearing TYA--in eight months or so--I'll put on Undead. It's pretty crude, but you know about old time's sake.
"
FALSE,B,The Classic Performances of Ten Years After,Ten Years After,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7996,"
OK, so the classic performances are on Deram. Neoclassic, then. I still find that their late phase has its kinetic (as we used to say) charms. And admit that even without the regrettable ""Positive Vibrations"" I'd be very unlikely to play this except for historical reference.
"
FALSE,B,End of the Millennium Psychosis Blues,That Petrol Emotion,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6157,"
So what happened to these guys? I know, they depunkified, but just because they seem to think funk has something to do with Tower of Power is no reason to take them off the guest list. Read the lyric sheet--if anything, they've grown in wisdom. Although if you didn't read the lyric sheet you'd never notice. That's what happened.
"
FALSE,B,The Sound of the Sand and Other Songs of the Pedestrian,David Thomas and the Pedestrians,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8487,"
It's not as if the last two Ubu albums didn't hint at such a consummation, but it's still a shock to hear Thomas dive like a fat swan into the art-rock he's accused of by prole ideologues. Smarter and funnier--more talented--than all but a few of the (mostly English) eccentrics who write oddly textured pancultural songs with drums but no beat about birds, shoes, hairpins, and other ""simple things,"" he ain't winging it. But he is more eccentric than one might hope. Interesting Note (to ""The New Atom Mine""): ""This song does not toast The Physicist as an individual or a class. Rather, it's an expression of appreciation for the publishing of exciting information.""
"
FALSE,B,Variations on a Theme,David Thomas and the Pedestrians,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8488,"
David Thomas leader-member was willing to have his ideas fucked with; David Thomas solo isn't. Maybe that's because the ideas have gotten narrower; they've certainly gotten slighter. His whimsies can be charming, his jokes are often worth a chuckle, and he couldn't ask for more sensitive accompanists than Richard Thompson and Anton Fier. Maybe someday he'll write a Peter and the Wolf for our time.
"
FALSE,B,Monster Walks the Winter Lake,David Thomas and the Wooden Birds,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8490,"
David's in fine talk-show form on side one, peddling metaphysics and quoting dictionaries and wending his way through the associative title tale. The music follows along just right, and his monster postscripts are also fun. But side two is associative enough to make one wonder just how interesting one fellow's fantasy life can be.
"
FALSE,B,One Clear Moment,Linda Thompson,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8492,"
Nothing like a busted marriage to bring out the latent feminism in a woman, and this one has a mouth on her--""Hell, High Water and Heartache"" makes me wonder whether she got cheated out of some publishing on ""Hard Luck Stories."" So lyrics, while not always brilliant, aren't the problem. Problem's musical conception, which between producer Hugh Murphy and collaborator Betsy Cook turns this into the best Carly Simon record I've heard in a while.
"
FALSE,B,Strict Tempo!,Richard Thompson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8493,"
Cut in 1981, these ""traditional and modern tunes for all occasions"" are strictly instrumental, with Dave Mattacks holding the tempo. They're recommended to folkies, ex-folkies, guitar adepts, and students of European song. The Duke Ellington cover excepted, I just wish they swung as much as the rest of Thompson's catalogue.
"
FALSE,B,Small Town Romance,Richard Thompson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8494,"
What can it mean that the five best cuts on this live-and-unaccompanied-in-1982 cult item are the five he's never recorded before. It means that as a singer he has real trouble carrying slow songs that were designed for Linda and/or a band, preferably both, and that his solo versions of the fast ones can't compete with a memory. Granted, his new songs are so winning cultists won't care. What this half-cultist wonders is how much he knew when he wrote the oh-so-true ""Love Is Bad for Business.""
"
FALSE,B,"(Guitar, Vocal)",Richard Thompson,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8495,"
Thompson was once the most scandalously unavailable English artist in America. Now he not only has a cult that sells compilation cassettes to fanzine subscribers, he has a cult that includes a small record company. Which in addition to compiling this not unpleasing two-record set of outtakes and live stuff keeps all his real albums in print. That's a hint.
"
FALSE,B,Daring Adventures,Richard Thompson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2946,"
I don't think it's the material and I hope it's not Thompson--with nuevo roots hack Mitchell Froom introducing his charge to the band and then saying go, there's no way to be sure. Somebody put those guitar breaks in an emulator right now.
"
FALSE,B,First Light,Richard & Linda Thompson,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2941,"
Richard T. has always redeemed corny themes with a humor dry enough to be mistaken for nasty, as when he includes ""I'll punch you in the nose"" in a list of odd jobs he'll do. But nowhere else on ""Restless Highway,"" ""Sweet Surrender,"" and ""The Choice Wife Died for Love""--the bulk of side one--do the lyrics deviate from the expectable. Just as distressing, the guitar veers away from Thompson's unique, timeless modalism toward the studio country-rock favored by new sidemen Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark. I love ""Strange Affair,"" one of his greatest death songs yet, and still find the austere harmonies bracing. But I want the Thompsons' pervasive Anglicism straight when I want it at all.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Mixes/The Best of Thompson Twins,The Thompson Twins,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3879,"
Their star power was so evanescent that they commemorate themselves as a dance act rather than a pop act, which is fine as far as song selection goes--this is most of what you'll want to remember before you forget. But from a pop perspective the Thompsons are why DOR turned into a dirty acronym: their tepid beats will drift anyone who isn't an acolyte of cool off the floor, and their pop is so wispy it fades before their dance mixes are over.
"
FALSE,B,George Thorogood and the Destroyers,George Thorogood and the Destroyers,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1389,"
What is it that a blues interpreter black or white is supposed to do? Something about making the song his (or hers, Bonnie)--the way Mick Jagger always does, even on his absurd version of ""I Just Wanna Make Love to You."" Thorogood claims only ""One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer."" And if the rest sounds good when it comes on the radio, that says more about the radio than it does about the rest.
"
FALSE,B,Move It on Over,George Thorogood and the Destroyers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8004,"
It's impossible not to be charmed by Thorogood's enthusiasm, and instrumentally this band is as likable as, say, Hound Dog Taylor's HouseRockers. But only closet folkies could vest hope in a noncomposer whose taste in material is markedly less interesting than the Blues Brothers' and whose only virtue as a vocalist is his complete lack of embarrassment. Harmless, but inconsequential.
"
FALSE,B,It Ain't Easy,Three Dog Night,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8005,"
Admitting it won't gain me any of the hip cachet I crave, but I admired and enjoyed this group's first LP. I found the second mediocre and the live job that followed it wretchedly excessive, but this one--their fourth in just fourteen months--gets back: exemplary song-finding and not too much plastic-soul melon-mouthing or preening vocal pyrotechnique. Highlights: the hit version of Randy Newman's ""Mama Told Me Not to Come,"" with just the right admixture of high-spirited schlock to turn it into the AM giant it deserves to be, and a departure from pre-Beatles times called ""Good Feeling (1957).""
"
FALSE,B,The Death of Everything,The Three Johns,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6094,"
Descrying the ""gothic"" tattoo that ID's a cartoon Jon Langford on the inner sleeve, I was reminded, invidiously, of his fondness for the Sisters of Mercy. The Johns are political jokers, hence not gothic two ways. But there isn't a track here as high-powered (or funny, or politically efficient) as ""This Corrosion,"" and from the sound Adrian Sherwood gets out of ""Never and Always,"" I just know Langford wishes there was. As well he might.
"
FALSE,B,Too Much Junkie Business,Johnny Thunders,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8504,"
Forced to chose between this Jimmy Miller-coproduced miscellany and the French live-LP-plus-studio-EP In Cold Blood--not to mention PVC's French-EP-plus-bait Diary of a Lover--I'd dig out So Alone or Live at Max's and ponder his spent youth. The tape costs less and has more new songs than the French package, which sounds better and runs a little longer. But neither sustains for more than five minutes at a stretch. Even from JT I expect consistency some of the time.
"
FALSE,B,Tiffany,Tiffany,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8505,"
As a commercial strategy, following a merely schlocky cover of a schlock-rock classic with the better of two schlock ballads was aces--number-one singles, double-platinum LP, what more could a svengali ask? But she's got better in her. This is a fantasy album about the growing pains of a wholesome California teen, flexing her sexuality slightly as she moons over that soulful Mexican boy, with two schlock classics of its own: ""Should've Been Me,"" jealously obsessing on an ex-boyfriend's jacket, and ""I Saw Him Standing There,"" which drags a rock and roll classic through the mud by its cheesy Prince-schlock synth riff. Beatlemaniacs who aren't even dead yet will roll over in their graves. I can't wait.
"
FALSE,B,Ancient Heart,Tanita Tikaram,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6120,"
Figure on some ethereal escapist or new age poseur and the dark, throaty contralto will bring you up short--it recalls much uglier people, like Marianne Faithfull, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell. The voice retains its interest, too--which is not repaid by promising lyrics that don't benefit from a lyric sheet or ingratiating tunes that deserve more help than Rod Argent can provide.
"
FALSE,B,Libby Titus,Libby Titus,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11311,"
I don't like this woman, who strikes me as a cutesy-pie snob with starfucker tendencies. But there's something sultry and smart in her voice that turns me on. And although there are too many Carly Simon compositions on side two (now I know--it's the singer and the song), I suspect I'll be playing side one again some time, no doubt when I'm in the mood for a sharp cutie-pie who might conceivably mistake me for a star.

When I hear Tomlin impersonate Suzie Sorority or explain how she managed to play a heterosexual in Nashville (""I've seen these women all my life, so I know how they walk, I know how they talk"".)

""Turn It Over"" is an instrumental. So's ""Turn It Up."" ""Chatty Chatty"" is a charming throwaway. So's ""Dilly Dally."" Let's Get It Together"" is a message number. So's ""Israel Children."" ""Journeyman"" is about just who you'd hope, for better and worse.

FALSE,B,Legalize It,Peter Tosh,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8010,"
Unlike most sidemen who go on to pursue their own artistic interests, ex-Wailer Tosh has managed to gather about half an album for his solo debut, which ain't bad. ""Ketchy Shuby"" even has the makings of a novelty hit. But oh, how his light heart and romantic spirit are missed among his old mates.
"
FALSE,B,Wanted Dread or Alive,Peter Tosh,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8512,"
Tosh is more worldly-wise than the average reggae singer--maybe even smarter. Darryl Thompson's guitar gets rock-style solo space on several tracks here, but not rock-style aural prominence, and nice synthesis, and in general the music's subtlety is impressive. Especially if you're impressed by musical subtlety, if you know what I mean. I'm impressed by the Gwen Guthrie duet with the session-name horns pasted on. It stinks.
"
FALSE,B,Mama Africa,Peter Tosh,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8513,"
A surprisingly good album from a man who's been acting the fool for years, but the quality's in the groove, not the man--and in the Afrogroove rather than the reggae groove at that. Best songs: ""Stop That Train,"" which he almost ruins with lounge-roots phrasing, and ""Maga Dog,"" which has never sounded better. Both were written in the '60s.

A Malian whose guitar owes onetime employer John Lee Hooker, Toure fascinates students of the Africa-blues connection, and his side-openers and foot-stomping Hook tribute are good to hear. Nevertheless, I prefer my blues with a rhythm section. I also prefer Hook.

""Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky,"" announces the pianist-composer-producer-arranger behind dozens of New Orleans hits on a great cut that Lee Dorsey did even better, but lurking amid the ensuing instrumentals are Roger Williams (maybe somebody classier, but that's who it sounds like to me), ""The Hallelujah Chorus,"" and Vince Guaraldi. Granted, on the A side Toussaint sings five excellent songs, four of which he wrote himself. But Joe Simon did better with ""Chokin' Kind."" And Lee Dorsey did better with ""Working in a Coal Mine.""

FALSE,B,Tower of Power,Tower of Power,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8017,"
Come off it, guys. You really lucked out with Lenny Williams and you know it--when he swoops up that way he makes it sound as if Aretha herself ought to cover ""This Time It's Real,"" which isn't likely. So get all those horns out of his face. I know there are five of you, but why not just make fancy with the Pointer Sisters and leave Lenny be? You said it yourselves, or rather, Lenny did: ""Sometimes hipness is what it ain't.""
"
FALSE,B,Live and in Living Color,Tower of Power,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8020,"
I guess they really are hot live if it comes across on the live album--the uptempo numbers have real edge, and Lenny Pickett's long honk on the 23:40-minute ""Knock Yourself Out"" is such a gas it makes the ensuing organ solo endurable. But Hubert Tubbs just isn't Lenny Williams--he makes the appropriate vocal sounds at the appropriate junctures, but that's all. This ruins the ballads, never a strong point. And Lenny Pickett's tweets don't add much either.
"
FALSE,B,The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys,Traffic,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4034,"
These guys waste their talent--they're devoid of intellectual thrust, they've never figured out what to do with their beloved jam form, and more often than not their lyrics are designed only to fill holes in the music or the meter. Yet they're onto something here. Their modest improvisations have a lot more force and hook appeal than the ones of John Barleycorn, they've figured out how to incorporate horns without compromising their electricity, and sometimes it even sounds as if Winwood knows why he's singing. When it works, it suggests a nice paradox--relaxed and exciting at the same time.

I hum the title track and admire three of the remaining five, but at a distance. One sharp figure of speech per song--next to ""burn baby burn"" my favorite occurs in ""Body Contact Contract,"" where the ""party of the first part"" parties--doesn't make up for how forced they sound when they're bad--or admirable.

In theory I'm glad their ex-corporation has repackaged Trammps as a pure disco album. In practice I get distracted during the breaks and don't find the new dance cuts any more appealing than the old ballads.

By Sigue Sigue Sputnik out of Blondie and T. Rex, and some suspect them of being--oh, the shame of it--posers; G. Cosloy claims they are as McDonald's is to a home-cooked meal. Which is what they get for wearing their inauthenticity on their sleeves in a rock and roll nation riven by identity crisis. My complaint is their inadequate command of trash--better riffs are available for hijacking. As things stand, their Holly and the Italians cover cuts not only ""Revolution Baby"" but ""Andy Warhol's Dead.""

As an acoustic warrior, back when he spelled out his group's first name and did concept albums about unicorns, Marc Bolan was considered ""progressive,"" which meant he was as foolish as Donovan but not as famous. A freak hit turned him into a singer of rhythmic fairy tales for British pre-pubes, exactly what he was always suited for, and the great ""Bang a Gong"" extends his subject matter into the rock myth itself, which has its limits but sure beats unicorns. Now if he'd only recycle a few more pop readymades I could stop complaining about fey.

Forget Donna Summer--this is the real disco porn. She's covered on the cover right up to the clavicle, her rhythms sound more binary than her producer's, and she can't sing a lick.

Musically and verbally, TSOL stand between the high-school protest of L.A. neopunk and the collegiate lyricism of L.A. neopsychedelia. Wordwise this is half a disaster--their colors running into the sand are even less interesting than Black Flag's antiauthoritarian rant or the Dream Syndicate's postnarcissistic angst. It's only because of the lyric sheet that you notice, though--Jack Delauge yawps out catchphrases as passable as anybody's and pretty much garbles the rest. And while the musical synthesis isn't as formally sophisticated as that of the more fashionable new American sound bands, it's more direct, so robust and determined it blows all suspicions of nostalgia away.

FALSE,B,Drifters,True West,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8531,"
They're still loud, they're still songful, but the balance is now so cautious that their elegiac, hard-driving Television-goes-country-rock wins this month's Trouser Press Memorial What-Does-It-All-Mean Award for Formalism, an eye-catching statuette of gilded virgin vinyl that looks kind of like an ear and kind of like a question mark. Blame it on the new drummer if you want. My guess is attrition, a/k/a maturity.
"
FALSE,B,Mental Decay,Tru Fax and the Insaniacs,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8532,"
So many indie LPs are as useless as the slimiest megacorp product that this near-miss from D.C. is worth remembering. Diana Quinn's fey feminism and David Wells's broken buzzsaw ride the flat garage rhythms as far as they'll go, which means their half-absurdist ditties work best when they're purely satirical. ""Up in the Air"" is the funniest (and archest) anti-Reagan song to date and ""Washington"" hits suburbia where it lives (for once).
"
FALSE,B,"""The Best"" Ambiance",Bibi Den's Tshibaya,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8533,"
From Africa via la France, another four-cut disco (""soukous"") album from the authenticity-mongers in Somerville. Because it's disco, it's more useful than most authenticity; because it's authentic, it's more engaging than most disco. Next.
"
FALSE,B,Livin' and Learnin',Tanya Tucker,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8037,"
The gain in assurance and excitement should put to rest all narrow-spirited suspicions that only Billy Sherrill's cracker acumen can shape Tanya's voice. But the voice remains a dirty one, which means that those songs that broaden her appeal by forcing her to play the ingenue tend to unfocus the persona behind subtler lyrics like Sterling Whipple's ""Makin' Love Don't Always Make Love Grow."" Highlights: two rockers, one from Fats Domino, the other from the Eagles.
"
FALSE,B,Bad Dreams,Ike Turner,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8041,"
After twenty years of raking it in from the shadows, he's finally figured out a way of applying his basically comic bass/baritone to rock and roll. Studio-psychedelic New Orleans, echoes of the Band and Dr. John, some brilliant minor r&amp;b mixed in with the dumb stuff. My God--at the moment he's more interesting than Tina.
"
FALSE,B,Workin' Together,Ike & Tina Turner,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8043,"
There's a pretty fair remake of ""Ooh Poo Pah Doo"" in between the two great cuts on this album--the easy-to-rough ""Proud Mary"" (with Ike rolling in back) and their first successful ""peace and love"" ""generation"" song, appropriately entitled ""Funkier Than a Mosquita's Tweeter."" Someone named Eki Renrut contributes a pretty fair do-right-man song. And Tina tries valiantly to sing her way out of some gunny sacks.
"
FALSE,B,Ron Turner,Ron Turner,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8049,"
This folkie throwback supports the argument that it's easier to play the outlaw if you don't need roadies with pack mules to lug your amplifiers across the wide open spaces. Armed with a twelve-string and a sense of humor, Turner obviously yokes his imagination to felt experience than production schedules, and his flat monotone is often pretty droll. He makes rock and roll sound even bleaker.
"
FALSE,B,Acid Queen,Tina Turner,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8050,"
Her rock myth reconfirmed cinematically, Tina quickly turns out two from the Who (only fair), two from the Stones (who else?), and one from Led Zep (""Whole Lotta Love,"" brilliant, I trust R. Plant has his big twelve-inch in a sling at this very moment). With bass lines lifted whole from the originals the singing almost doesn't matter. And what rocks most mythically? I. Turner's cleverly entitled ""Baby--Get It On.""
"
FALSE,B,Tina Live in Europe,Tina Turner,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6098,"
Almost two hours of double-LP, with an extra half of covers on cassette and CD, and not as pointless as you think. It's interesting to hear songs originally crafted for 64-track crossover streamlined or steamrollered by the gruffly inexorable forward motion of a crack road show, and sometimes--a ""Break Every Rule"" with that live elle-sait-quoi followed by a sharply funky ""I Can't Stand the Rain,"" or most of side three, from Pickett parlay to Cray and Clapton cameos to the inevitable ""Proud Mary""--there are transformations or revelations. Then there's the Bryan Adams cameo. And before that there are the David Bowie cameos--two of the ugly things.
"
FALSE,B,"Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes",TV on the Radio,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12506,"
Intelligent, honest, and original ought to be enough. But in fact there are acres, tons, and years of bad art that share these virtues, especially if ""original"" is interpreted generously, which it better be with the world's hundredth or thousandth guitars-and-loops outfit. Really. Take-him-or-leave-him singer. No great shakes melodically or rhythmically. Approximately as insightful in re the exigencies of male-and-female as 50 years of male chauvinists before them. Always humorless, sometimes sententious. All told, pretty dull--unless you're so desperate that you'll sing hosanna for every piece of intelligent-honest-original that comes down the circuit.
"
FALSE,B,Twilley Don't Mind,Dwight Twilley Band,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1104,"
If the twelve-cut debut was notable for its songs, this nine-cut follow-up puts the emphasis on sound--a deep, rather eerie, yet undeniably pop sound that reminds me more than anything of the Flamin' Groovies' Supersnazz. And as with the Flamin' Groovies, the sound creates a distance between Twilley and his hooks. But even though I can make up neat theories about how Twilley evokes a comparable distance in the lyrics, I certainly prefer Supersnazz.
"
FALSE,B,Conway Twitty's Greatest Hits Volume II,Conway Twitty,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8055,"
Twitty has grown artistically, which I guess is admirable in a forty-three-year-old country singer. I can only guess because although I'm glad he's traded big-ballad stolidity for honky-tonk stretch and catch, I'm not so glad he's writing his own songs. Too often he muddles country's adult themes with the teen romanticism of his early rockabilly success, and sometimes he's just inept--in ""The Games That Daddies Play"" a seven-year-old makes a speech that could have been written by the seven-year-old's therapist, while in ""Don't Cry Joni"" there are plot details that could have been devised by a seven-year-old.
"
FALSE,B,The Very Best of Conway Twitty,Conway Twitty,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8056,"
For me it's simple. I like Conway on classic--which means guilt- or pain-ridden--cheating songs. I don't like him so much when he starts comparing his wife invidiously to some idealized Linda, Georgia, or honky-tonk angel. And on ordinary country songs he's a slightly better than ordinary country singer.
"
FALSE,B,2 Nice Girls,Two Nice Girls,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4057,"
With Nice Girl number three helping them do the Roches, their hook is ""Sweet Jane"" with a Joan Armatrading tag, tart and pretty enough to show up the C. Junkies' suicidal tendencies. Ex-Meat Joy Gretchen Phillips's salty attitude permeates the discreetly physical lesbian love song ""Goons"" and the regretfully rowdy lesbian love anthem ""I Spent My Last $10.00 (On Birth Control and Beer)."" Laurie Freelove counts Cat Stevens among her influences.
"
FALSE,B,UB40 CCCP--Live in Moscow,UB40,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8540,"
To the usual concert-album flaws of redundancy (Labour of Love and Rat in the Kitchen revisited) and speedup (what do Russians know of deep grooves?), UB40 adds a presumably well-intentioned attempt to cram an hour of music onto one vinyl disc. As a result, the vocals are even hollower and duller than you'd expect--on vinyl. The CD, wouldn't you know, is markedly richer and clearer. But for sheer audio I still prefer Little Baggariddim.
"
FALSE,B,Labour of Love II,UB40,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4076,"
The differences are subtle, like everything with this band--rather then being dashed, your high hopes for the sequel succumb to a lingering illness. The beat glides a little too much, the synth washes a little too much, Ali Campbell sings the prize covers a little less and runs them through his voice a little more. And maybe, just maybe, the covers themselves aren't quite as prize.
"
FALSE,B,U.K. Squeeze,U.K. Squeeze,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7846,"
Musically, the instrumental is the only boring cut on the whole first side, but the record as a whole is a case study in excitingly adequate hard rock craftsmanship spoiled by trashy literature. When a band obviously influenced by Queen, Rock Scene, muscle mags, and boarding-school porn finishes off by advising their postpunk admirers to ""get smart,"" it sounds like they want 'em to stop reading Hustler and start reading Oui.
"
FALSE,B,Ultravox!,Ultravox,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4079,"
""I want to be a machine"" is their slogan, and with Eno producing one would hope for the best. But only on ""My Sex"" do they go all the way; more often these tough-surfaced post-Velvets songs identify with ""the wild, the beautiful, and the damned."" Eno helps them sound like a machine regardless, but unlike Eno they don't seem to enjoy it much. Which calls their humanity into question.
"
FALSE,B,Face to Face With the Truth,The Undisputed Truth,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11720,"
Connoisseurs of Motown nouveau find this impossibly slick and fakey, which is just what I like about it. Admittedly, it's nowhere near as good as good Marvin Gaye, but its failures aren't as bathetic, either.
"
FALSE,B,Urban Dance Party,The Urbations,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8548,"
""Goin' to Alpena, Cement Capital of the World,"" begins the twelve-bar blues that begins this tape, and I wish I could tell you it ever got that good again. Andy Boller and Mr. Dr. Blurt Sandblaster do enjoy their laughs--listen to the roller-rink organ Boller lays beneath the horny ""I Need a Job""--but they don't write or sing with the difference that can raise neoclassicist white r&amp;b to the level of necessity.
"
FALSE,B,UTFO,UTFO,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8550,"
For years rappers boasted that they were in it for the money, which given the amounts of money involved proved how close to the street they still were. These days you can't be so sure. After announcing their educated synthesis with a verse in pig Latin on their first single, the new guys on the block have proven street professionals--if they don't use a rhyming dictionary, then they'll probably market one. And Full Force comes up with the one great hook Roxanne Roxanne needs.
"
FALSE,B,Skeezer Pleezer,UTFO,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8551,"
Some of their sketches and tall tales--especially the cheerfully amoral anticrime versifying of ""Just Watch""--sound observed. But too often the gimmicks are received and the generalizations fabricated. And they can not ""sing a little bit.""
"
FALSE,B,Wide Awake in America,U2,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8553,"
Especially after their unstinting live mini, this four-cut ""special low priced collection of live recordings and out takes from the Unforgettable Fire tour and album"" looks like the usual special low priced gyp. But though the outtakes wouldn't have been missed, they're OK to hear, and the opener, an eight-minute amplification of one of Unforgettable Fire's more obscure titles, is why they could get away with superstar rip-offs if they wanted. Maybe Bono's charisma assumes special access to truth, but he doesn't act like that makes him more important than anyone else, and the Edge's elegiac guitar is self-effacing in much the same way--it exists to serve the awesome effect. Epic humility--take it or leave it.
"
FALSE,B,The Joshua Tree,U2,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4064,"
Let it build and ebb and wash and thunder in the background and you'll hear something special--mournful and passionate, stately and involved. Read the lyrics and you won't wince. Tune in Bono's vocals and you'll encounter one of the worst cases of significance ever to afflict a deserving candidate for superstardom.
"
FALSE,B,Give Me the Reason,Luther Vandross,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8558,"
If only Luther had a little less integrity he might sell out--he's such a great singer he could transform crossover twaddle into universal trivia without even breathing hard. Alas, he's also such a great singer he doesn't have to. But not such a great singer he can interest simple pop fans in his own songs.
"
FALSE,B,Women and Children First,Van Halen,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8559,"
Eddie VH's quicksilver whomp earns the Hendrix comparisons, and he's no clone--he's faster, colder, more structural. David Lee Roth adds a wild-ass sophistication to the usual macho--no mortal arena singer would even think of the goofy country blues takeoff that provides the title. But the message of the music isn't the exuberance of untrammeled skill, it's the arrogance of unchallenged mastery. Without being pompous about it, which is a plus, these guys show as little feeling for their zonked, hopelessly adoring fans as Queen. They're kings of the hill and we're not.
"
FALSE,B,Wild-Eyed Dream,Ricky Van Shelton,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8361,"
In his white cowboy hat and sleeveless undershirt, he's as honest as George Strait with a day job--except maybe when picking an album title, because like most neotraditionalists he's too damned tasteful to stay wild-eyed long. As I hope he's noticed, the outlandish ""Crime of Passion"" is his ticket to ride. Guarantee you it will be remembered when all the small perfect moments surrounding it have passed into good-taste limbo.
"
FALSE,B,Texas Flood,Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3343,"
People who think white guitarists with the blues are the essence of rock and roll never fully account for Alvin Lee, not to mention Robin Trower. I think rock and roll's essence inheres in momentum and song form, and find my attention wandering after the kickoff originals ""Love Struck Baby"" and ""Pride and Joy.""
"
FALSE,B,Beautiful Thing,Ben Vaughn Combo,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8567,"
Unlike many comedians, this mild-mannered male chauvinist is funniest when he lets on how clever he is, as in ""Jerry Lewis in France,"" ""Growin' a Beard,"" and ""I'm Sorry (But So Is Brenda Lee),"" only one of which he was clever enough to put on his first U.S. album. He'll never be a Crenshaw (definitive ""Brenda Lee""), but his rockabilly as whisper and idea has gained oomph--if he lets it all hang out he may eventually be as commercial as the Morells (definitive ""Growin' a Beard"").
"
FALSE,B,Generic Blues Album,Maurice John Vaughn,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6232,"
""Don't you play the name game/`Cause the quality is the same"" is just one of ""Generic Blues""'s many zingers, and he almost gets away with the conceit. I don't know, though--lacks identity somehow.
"
FALSE,B,Escape From Babylon,Martha Velez,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11305,"
This Marley-produced reggae venture suffers from the fatal reggae monotony, but she's a warm, accomplished singer in a solidly intelligent groove, and her seriousness is established. If you're looking for women artists to relate to, this is a hell of a lot better place to start than Wendy Waldman.
"
FALSE,B,Voyage,Voyage,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8069,"
The ultimate kitsch--travelogue disco. For instance, what udderlike instrument do you think might be featured on ""Scotch Machine""?
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton,Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8070,"
There are real pleasures here, but they're chiefly vocal. The surprises are few, the jokes weak and infrequent, the sentimentality overripe (""Jeanie's Afraid of the Dark,"" yeucch), and the best song's by Paxton, nor Parton. In short, a lousy ad for couple-bonding, though whether Porter is repressing Dolly or Dolly holding out on Porter I wouldn't know.
"
FALSE,B,Protest,Bunny Wailer,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8071,"
Neither Bunny's voice, strong by Jamaican standards but no soul shout, nor reggae's persuasive but rarely irrefutable rhythms, are suited to the more forceful (or is it just louder?) procedures of this follow-up. The decrease in compassion, consolation, and--most directly to the political point--inspiration is less a matter of the words themselves than of how they're sung, but never on the last record did he resort to such radio-preacher pretensions as ""the rock of discretion/Will calm the floods of conflict."" Not to mention an antiabortion line.
"
FALSE,B,Rule Dance Hall,Bunny Wailer,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8585,"
Bunny follows his failed bid for the marketplace by going to the people where his roots are. The results are definitely more ital, and more philosophically defensible as well. But the first side doesn't update his circa-1982 reggae&amp;b quite nicely enough, and except for the ""Stir It Up"" remake, the songs on side two are a little too dubwise--abstractly dance-specific in the usual manner of disco turned in on itself.
"
FALSE,B,Liberation,Bunny Wailer,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=502,"
He's studied his history, and the politics of his major statement are pretty smart. But ordinarily, only earnest organizer types who distribute lyrics at rallies (""To the tune of `Down by the Riverside'"") think they can get a rousing song out of a line like ""The OAU and the United Nations must stop all hypocritical sanctions."" Bunny should know better than to hire studio musicians to do what they're told.
"
FALSE,B,Fame and Wealth,Loudon Wainwright III,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8587,"
Loudon's most confident album since he split with CBS in 1975 is also his least ambitious, done folkie-style with two penetrating embellishments from Richard Thompson and two band cuts. For a while he walks his old tightrope, wild and nasty enough to make his chronic egoism seem of general interest. But the jokes and feelings are getting thinner, and soon you'll find yourself wishing he'd grow up, shut up, or both.
"
FALSE,B,Nighthawks at the Diner,Tom Waits,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8076,"
When he really works at evoking the swizzle-stick blues, Waits is so full of shit Port-O-San ought to name a model after him. Fortunately, this one's long on patter--first live double in history where you skip the song to get to the next intro. (And some of the songs are worth going back to.)
"
FALSE,B,Foreign Affairs,Tom Waits,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8078,"
I like the poetry-with-jazz for ""Jack &amp; Neal,"" the mumbled monologue ""Barber Shop,"" the Anglophile ""Foreign Affair,"" and a duet with Bette on ""I Never Talk to Strangers."" But I get off the trolley at ""Potter's Field,"" a production number for a high-rolling nightstick who crossed ""from the Bronx to the River Styx."" With his genre sleaze and metaphorical melodrama, Waits is a downwardly mobile escapist who believes that Everyman is a wino and Everywoman an all-night waitress who turns tricks when things get rough. The problem isn't the subjects themselves, but that for all his self-conscious unpretentiousness he inflates them. Which I guess is all we can expect of a schoolteacher's son who's been searching for his own world since he was old enough to think.
"
FALSE,B,Blue Valentine,Tom Waits,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8079,"
Waits keeps getting weirder and good for him. As sheer sendup, his ""Somewhere"" beats Sid Vicious's ""My Way"" his way. But I'm not always sure he understands his gift--these lyrics should be funnier. And ""Romeo Is Bleeding,"" easily my favorite among his Chandleroid sagas of tragedy outside the law, is more effective on the jacket than when he underlines its emotional resonance in song. That's not weird at all.
"
FALSE,B,Heartattack and Vine,Tom Waits,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8591,"
Lurching from hip to bathetic in his doomed pursuit of the let's-get-wasted market, he needs an editor more than Jack Kerouac ever did. But Kerouac rarely came up with tropes as axiomatic as ""I sold a quart of blood and bought a half a pint of Scotch"" or ""If you don't get my letter, then you'll know that I'm in jail,"" neither of which ought to spend their lives buried in overgrown verbiage and stentorian second-line. And sometimes he gets away with his shit, as in the tearfully tuneful ""Jersey Girl"" or the blisteringly bluesy ""Mr. Siegal""--or ""Heartattack and Vine,"" which could make you hope he's getting tired of getting wasted.
"
FALSE,B,Franks Wild Years,Tom Waits,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3998,"
Amid these fragments from a musical that wouldn't make all that much sense fully staged, you'll find five-six songs that stand on their own--couple howlin' blues, coupla tuneful heart-tuggers, coupla Wayne Newton parodies. But if in the '20s Rudy Vallee sang through a megaphone because he wanted to sound modern, in the '80s Waits sings through a megaphone because he wants to sound old. This being the '80s, you're free to prefer Waits--as long as you don't kid yourself too much about his conceptual thrust.
"
FALSE,B,Big Time,Tom Waits,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5947,"
Sure he's an American original and all that. But from half-assed one-man original-cast album to soundtrack of filmed live show, Waits continues to confound the categories more aimlessly than seems necessary. Not counting one shaggy testicle story, the sharpest moments here subject overlooked songs to a crack cabaret-tinged band. From American originals I expect bigger surprises.
"
FALSE,B,Blue Soul,Joe Louis Walker,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8595,"
I know, life is never this simple. But last time bass player Henry Oden had four songwriting credits, three of them winners. This time he's got none. Standout: the unsoullike, unaccompanied ""I'll Get to Heaven on My Own.""
"
FALSE,B,Sippie Wallace,Sippie Wallace,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8596,"
This project scrapes by on taste and good intentions--the selection of songs by Wallace and contemporaries, Bonnie Raitt's unobtrusive voice and slide, and the impeccable swing of pianist Jim Dapogny and his Chicago Jazz Band. The problem is that where Alberta Hunter commands an almost regal strength in her eighties, Wallace sounds like a cartoon granny with denture problems. Her lyrics still sting after half a century, and her phrasing puts them across, but she doesn't even hint at the young Sippie's hard-won erotic composure. CBS and RCA: reissue.
"
FALSE,B,Call of the West,Wall of Voodoo,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8597,"
Those who believe synth-pop means that the end is near should cf. WoV's 1980 EP, which gave no hint they were capable of tunes as neat and witty as ""Mexican Radio"" or ""Lost Weekend."" Maybe soon vocalist-lyricist Stanard Ridgway will fall in love with a human and start pretending he's a nice guy.
"
FALSE,B,The World Is a Ghetto,War,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4132,"
According to all my own theories, I should love this big Afro-roots band with the number one album, but it's hard. Jazz pretensions are one problem--""City, Country, City"" has a firm bottom, but it's thirteen minutes long, and up top is mush. And if ""That's What Love Will Do"" was Vanilla Fudge, ""Four Cornered Room"" makes me think they're trying to start their own genre--blackstrap-rock, they could call it.
"
FALSE,B,Galaxy,War,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8091,"
The first side of the most unambitious album they've ever made works beautifully as what it is--P-Funk on thorazine, with the phrasemaking acuity of previous War records reduced to one title, ""Sweet Fighting Lady."" Side two winds down from a pretty good hit single into fourteen minutes of carrying unambitiousness way too far.
"
FALSE,B,Outlaw,War,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8599,"
The pan-Afro-American groove is sharper and the tempos often approach medium fast, but the music sounds almost vintage anyway and that's the big surprise--why should they make their best album nearly a decade after their prime? Professionalism is its own reward--for once. Almost.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Steve Wariner,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8600,"
""What I Didn't Do"" puts sins of omission on country's conjugal hit list. ""Small Town Girl"" concentrates the whole of a genre's nostalgia on one overburdened woman from back home. ""The Weekend"" takes him off the deep end and he figures better that than nothing. After that, it's pretty generic--but likably generic, which in MOR country is an accomplishment these days.
"
FALSE,B,The London Muddy Waters Sessions,Muddy Waters,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8098,"
Howlin' Wolf had the Rolling Stones for his London session, so how come Muddy only got Rory Gallagher, Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, and Mitch Mitchell for his? Maybe because this one was a money gig from the git-go. Anyway, only Gallagher--the sole committed blues player of the four--is exceptional, and Muddy sounds like the aging pro he is. One exception is ""Blind Man Blues,"" with nice backup from Rosetta Hightower. The other is ""Walkin' Blues,"" featuring nobody but Muddy and Sam Lawhorn, who is from Chicago.
"
FALSE,B,I'm Ready,Muddy Waters,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2477,"
Not as ready as you were last time, Mud, but don't let it worry you--it's always harder to get hard again again.

FALSE,B,Radio KAOS,Roger Waters,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8602,"
In which Waters's wheelchair-bound version of the deaf, dumb, and blind boy learns to control the world's computers with his cordless phone, then simulates impending nuclear holocaust just to scare the shit out of the powers that be. I have serious reservations about any record that can't be enjoyed unless you sit there reading the inner sleeve, but this is not without its aural rewards--a coverable song or two and some nice comping on shakuhachi as well as the deep engineering that made Floyd famous. As pretentious goes, not stupid.
"
FALSE,B,Big Girls Don't Cry,The Weather Girls,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8606,"
At a moment when soul is resurfacing as an ear-catching set of usages, a form basically independent of its original sources, these fat ladies--abetted by a new production team, and so it goes--take it one step further and make soul a cartoon, with the title cut the masterstroke. They'll cop material anywhere--debut single's from Jesse Winchester. And if at first their tricks seem inspired, by the time you get to Creedence and Neil Sedaka they're beginning to sound obvious.

In a Silent Way played mostly for atmosphere. The Milesian demi-jazz of side two sounds pretty finky (no misprint intended), but the tone-poem impressionism of side one does its mysterious work. Highlight: the opening mood piece, ""Milky Way,"" in which two Silent Way vets, soprano saxophonist Wayne Shorter and pianist Joe Zawinul, make sounds that suggest a carillon approaching a time warp.

FALSE,B,I Sing the Body Electric,Weather Report,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4157,"
Significantly less Milesian than their debut, which is impressive but not necessarily good--the difference is that this is neater, more antiseptic, its bottom less dirty and its top less sexy. I find myself interested but never engaged, and I'm sure one piece is a flop--""Crystals,"" described by the annotator as ""about"" time. Sing the body electric and I'm with you. Sing the body short-circuited and you'd better turn me on.

FALSE,B,Sweetnighter,Weather Report,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4158,"
Ask yourself: What kind of a jazz (or rock) (or jazz-rock) group would conceive its sonar identity around electric keyboards and soprano sax? A pretty dinky (not dunky) one, right? So while I'm pleased that they're going for a drum groove a little solider than anything Dom Um Romao can move and shake, I'm not surprised that they get it only--just barely, in fact--on ""125th Street congress."" And that ""Boogie Woogie Waltz"" is fatally cute, ace improvisations and all.

FALSE,B,Mysterious Traveler,Weather Report,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4159,"
Not bad, not bad--but is that all there is? Maybe what makes the traveller so mysterious is that he doesn't go anywhere in particular. Not even with Alphonso Johnson pushing like hell from underneath.
"
FALSE,B,Mr. Gone,Weather Report,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8103,"
I don't think it was the advent of Jaco Pastorius that triggered the band's ever more fusoid tendencies. Professional evolution, that's all. Like Black Market and Heavy Weather, this is short on rhythmic inspiration (four different drummers, no percussionists) and long on electric ivory. When I'm in the mood I can still get off on its rich colors and compositional flow. When I'm not I think dark thoughts about Muzak and Yurrup.
"
FALSE,B,Mountain,Leslie West,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11543,"
With Felix Pappalardi singing and playing bass regularly this could be New York's third supergroup. (The Rascals and the Spoonful got there first.) The visual possibilities alone--with West, the enormous ex-Vagrant guitarist, set against the hyperactive Pappalardi, are fantastic. West plays good guitar and is a good roarer, and Pappalardi is not only first-rate on several instruments but has a wonderful singing voice, sweet and mellow. Unfortunately, he hadn't decided to join the group when this was recorded, and so participates only as bassist and producer. West alone can't quite carry it. More like early Cream than Blind Faith.

FALSE,B,Make It Big,Wham!,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8609,"
Though George Michael seems more swellheaded than one would wish in a superstar (or a coworker), he does take care of business! His Isleys cover is less striking than his ersatz Motown! How many other pretty boys can make such a claim?!

FALSE,B,The Whispers,The Whispers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8109,"
They've been around forever because they're real pros, but that's all they are. Vocal-group fans will probably enjoy--check out these titles--""Lady"" and ""I Love You"" and ""Welcome Into My Dream,"" though I hope they stop at the sanctimonious ""Song for Donny"" and the pallid ""My Girl."" But what makes this a breakthrough is the three dance tracks. The great one, ""Out the Box,"" was written and coproduced by Leon Sylvers. In the great Sylvers tradition, you could almost mistake it for something you missed on Destiny or Off the Wall.
"
FALSE,B,I've Got So Much to Give,Barry White,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8111,"
White's hustle is to combine Isaac Hayes's power with Al Green's niceness, and he succeeds, in his way, but the synthesis has its drawbacks--tends to compound his humorlessness and mendacity as well. But as a fait accompli he has quite a bit of silly charm, and does he lay down some powerful tracks. Nor is his style as far removed from soul music as white soul conservatives (myself included) first assumed--the bass pulse has a Latin oomph undiminished by its fat-man's pace. And is that a barrelhouse harpsichord on ""Bring Back My Yesterdays""? Very, er, eclectic.
"
FALSE,B,Barry White the Man,Barry White,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8115,"
For those with a high giggle threshold, White's best music in years should prove a more than acceptable fuckalong. That's the A side. On the B side he essays ""Just the Way You Are.""
"
FALSE,B,Ecstasy,White Animals,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8612,"
Despite the off name and kalimba intro, I figured these Nashvillians for an especially one-dimensional bunch of popsters after happy songs like ""This Girl of Mine"" and ""You Started Something"" provided exactly what they promised. But eventually, wondering about the ""Gloria"" remake and the psychedelic blues, I realized that one-dimensionality is . . . not the point, because that would imply irony, but the payoff. Somehow these guys sincerely inhabit a very '60s-ish reality; their message isn't some kind of distanced commentary on their musical material, it's the material itself. They say they like soul, too, and I believe them.
"
FALSE,B,Live at Leeds,The Who,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3915,"
This band has never even tried to simulate stage power in the studio except on its raw debut, which makes side one, with its first-ever recordings of two key live covers and the first version of the classic ""Substitute"" available here on LP, doubly valuable. But side two extrapolates the uncool-at-any-length ""Magic Bus"" and the bish-bash climax of ""My Generation,"" which has to be seen to be believed. I much prefer the raw debut.
"
FALSE,B,Odds and Sods,The Who,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3913,"
Although Peter Townshend's genius (well, for once that's what it is) glimmers through on every one of these leftovers, all that glimmers is not gold, which is why most of them have been in the can for between three and seven years. The great exception is ""Little Billy,"" a cheerful, cruel smoking-is-dangerous-to-your-health song that the American Cancer Society chickened out on; it'd make a great public service ad on The Who Sell Out. There are also two pretty fair rock life songs--and ""Long Live Rock,"" a strained variation on that overworked theme. And to balance off the two pretty good devotional songs there's ""Faith in Something Bigger,"" which could serve as Nashville filler.
"
FALSE,B,The Kids Are Alright,The Who,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8119,"
I prefer the originals, but this isn't a bad sampler. All of the songs are good, many are classics, and the relative roughness of performance has its attractions even if the relative roughness of sound doesn't (most of them are from live dates never intended for vinyl). One thing I'd like to know, though--if he's so ""vital,"" how come twelve of the fifteen Townshend compositions are from the '60s?
"
FALSE,B,It Came from Nashville,Webb Wilder & the Beatnecks,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8623,"
Wilder is about as country as Olivia Newton-John. He's got one of those pencil-necked voices, like he not only went to college (which lots of real men and good old boys do these days) but maybe even prep school. His Steve Earle cover beats his Hank Williams cover, and his best song is about hanging out by a pool with a rule against dogs. And I almost don't care. Any Nashvillean who can honestly urge all his ""patrons in the teen and sub-teen demographic to pursue happiness at every opportunity"" gets slack from me.
"
FALSE,B,"Mud, Lies and Shame",Wild Seeds,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6153,"
A typical Amerindie story. Led by then-rockcrit Michael Hall, the Seeds took their Southwest-boho syncretism public in 1984 with a self-produced EP that hauled in heaps of hosannas, none so impolite as to note that not a single memorable song shored up the band's, what shall we call it, soulful Austin country-punk. Brave, Clean and Reverent, released in 1986 on the local Jungle label, failed to get them much further despite ace side-leaders: ""Sharlene,"" about Hall's crush on a pretty boy, and ""I Work Hard,"" about his compulsion to wage slavery. Now they've graduated to what's called a major indie, and the first three cuts are everything one could have hoped, especially the self-explanatory ""I'm Sorry, I Can't Rock You All Night Long,"" a true classic as these things are measured. The rest continue their project of defeating male chauvinism in the male chauvinist roots-rock context, but not so's you'd notice. In a saner world, this would be their debut album. It would include ""Sharlene"" and ""I Work Hard"" (without horns, please), encouraging everylistener to bear down on their lesser material, the best of which is more than passable. How they would have made a living in the meantime I couldn't tell you. How they make a living now I couldn't tell you either.

FALSE,B,I'm So Proud,Deniece Williams,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8626,"
Minnie Riperton she's not--really. Cameos from Johnny Mathis (body) and Philip Bailey (spirit) bring out the character in her pure, intense soprano, and ""Love, Peace and Unity"" mentions the ""arms race"" in a welcome moment of negativity. But Williams has progressed, as they say, from Thom Bell's pop romanticism to George Duke's cosmic idealism, and these fusion guys have never understood about songs.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Don Williams,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8122,"
In which this new country honcho--who as a founder of the Pozo-Seco Singers competed in the '60s downhome sweepstakes with the likes of Jim McGuinn--casts about for a style of gentleness that suits him. At its worst his torpid singing has all of Johnny Cash's monotonousness and none of his majesty. But he does reject the ranker strains of corn.

FALSE,B,The New South,Hank Williams Jr.,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8123,"
Dear Up-and-Comer: OK, pretty good for a country-rock album--more spirited than your second, less inspired than your first. But let me mention a few things. The Atlanta Braves are not, repeat not, ordinarily identified with the Old South. Rain gets to be a pretty tedious symbol of life's tribulations. The road gets to be a pretty tedious symbol of life's changes. And if you want to get away from Dad, well, I know it'd be a lot of trouble to change your name, but maybe you could do a whole album that doesn't refer to him at all. And you could stop doing his songs, too--it's bad luck that the best cut here is the one he wrote, now isn't it? I mean, you really could use a new exemplar. Good luck finding him or her. (Signed) Roll on, Dean. P.S. Not Waylon Jennings, either.

FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Hank Williams Jr.,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8628,"
He may be Rosa Luxemburg compared to the Nashville squares he's forever railing against, but he's also a self-indulgent, self-pitying, self-mythologizing MCP, and though this format maximizes the MCP's entertainment and truth value he doesn't get away with ""Kaw-Liga"" or ""Texas Women."" Rosa inspires ""The American Dream,"" which has truths to tell about a Hollywood square with the initials RR. The booster who made his debut on ""The New South"" tells two lies about New York.

FALSE,B,Otis Williams and the Midnight Cowboys,Otis Williams and the Midnight Cowboys,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8126,"
In which an old r&amp;b pro (the Charms, remember?) who used to sing harmony on King's country releases heads an all-black country band in a passionately subversive union of two disparate but parallel modes. Granted, his slightly melismatic tenor doesn't equal Charley Pride's penetrating baritone on ""Is Anybody Goin' to San Antone"" or ""Wonder Could I Live There Anymore."" But Charley would never deliver the ""come here boy"" in ""Muleskinner Blues"" with such sarcastic relish.

Q. Can a tear-jerker have a formal precision of its own? A. Maybe, if the singer wears black-rimmed glasses, keeps a microphone in his nose, and doesn't take his seriousness too seriously. Time 25:53.
"
FALSE,B,Wilma,Wilma,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8632,"
Some of their songs do well by such old staples as poststructuralism (""Life Without Adjectives"") and fuck-men (""Love Vaccine""); others don't. Their idiot-avant instrumentals (cf. the Residents, Toiling Midgets) are never as oppressive as Frightwig's generic hardcore, Salem 66's slave-pop, Throwing Muses's muse, etc. And their cover of ""Georgy Girl"" blows away such monumental precedents as the Raincoats' ""Lola"" and Y Pants' ""That's the Way Boys Are."" A sarcastic rollick through a song you never knew meant so much or so little, it's interrupted by a futuristic dream sequence in which Georgy joins a punk band and utters the following Inspirational Verse: ""I suppose you're thinking/We're a little queer/Well my boy I suggest you suck another beer/The bottle's warmyfru/It's got a foamy head/It doesn't cry it doesn't bleed it doesn't wet your bed.""
"
FALSE,B,Nothing But a Breeze,Jesse Winchester,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8133,"
One reason Winchester disappointed after his first album is that he was conceived as a singer-songwriter, expected to deliver a couple of gems and five or six semiprecious stones a year. Finally seeing him live with his cheerful, competent band was a revelation--suddenly he became a country singer who could also rock out. He proves it on this LP, which is, however, short on semiprecious stones and entirely gemless--although ""Gilding the Lily"" turns a cliche the way only a popular song can and the foolishness of ""Rhumba Man"" borders on brilliance.
"
FALSE,B,Run,The Windbreakers,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8636,"
Enough bands fail to craft tuneful yet hard-rocking pop albums to make the success of this Mitch Easter project reviewable: it's tuneful, and it's hard-rocking. But there's nothing in music/vocals/lyrics/image to attract anybody specifically to the Windbreakers, nothing more than there is in Jeffrey Osborne, or Hall &amp; Oates. In fact, they're less interesting than most stars, except maybe to young men who've devoted their lives to blurring the distinction between woman problems and girl trouble.
"
FALSE,B,London Town,Wings,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8138,"
McCartney's lyricism is so capricious, so given to inanity and icky-poo, that only at its very best--""With a Little Luck"" and the affectionate goof on ""Famous Groupies""--does it come on strong. But from its slices of life to its romantic reassurances this is nowhere near as feckless as the Old Band on the Run claque claims--even on the one about the fairy who'll invite us to tea Linda adds a few harmonies that are as charming as they're meant to be. And at the very least you have to be impressed by how steadfastly Paul has resisted supersessions--he's been loyal to his group, which has now recorded longer than the Beatles.
"
FALSE,B,They Only Come Out at Night,The Edgar Winter Group,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8143,"
This may be heavy, but it's fast, which means real rock and roll after the attempted progress and hyperboogie. And instead of hyperthyroid Jerry LaCroix we get Dan Hartman, who knows enough about songs to come up with ""Free Ride,"" and Ronnie Montrose, who knows enough about guitar to get by. Not only that, but Edgar's found a midrange. And not only that but he wears lipstick, eye makeup, and a cheek stud on the cover.
"
FALSE,B,Saints and Sinners,Johnny Winter,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8148,"
I think what puts me off this otherwise searing assertion of rock and roll prowess is the engineering. Rick Derringer has done the standard live-sound job, in which echo is amplified into unnatural ""depth,"" and theoretically that's fine. The average live-sound band is too busy doing promotional tours for its current album to worry about material for the next, but here the songs are lovingly chosen--there's even a good one from the pitiful Richard Supa. Rock and roll the way Johnny likes it, however, was meant to have a human dimension, and since he has trouble projecting irony or intimacy anyhow, a lot of these die a little when Derringer mixes them into heavy cuts.
"
FALSE,B,154,Wire,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4195,"
Predictions that these art-schoolers would turn into art-rockers no longer seem so cynical. Their gift for the horrifying vignette remains. But their tempos are slowing, sometimes to a crawl, as their textures venture toward the orchestral, and neither effect enhances the power of their vignettes, which become ever more personalistic and/or abstract.
"
FALSE,B,Document and Eyewitness,Wire,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8643,"
At first I diagnosed the grungy sound and semipro execution of this live LP-plus-EP as the band's worst case of arty-farty yet. But for all the chatter and false starts and extended instrumental nothings, it packs real momentum--you could even say it gets wild. The new songs are worthy of the name, too. So when it comes to arty-farty, I'll take this over the neaty-beaty of 154. By a hair and a half.

FALSE,B,Witch Queen,Witch Queen,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8154,"
Here Gino Soccio's disco goes pop, with the help of the Muscle Shoals boys and three jumpy, skillfully extended blasts from the riff-song past--Redbone's ""Witch Queen,"" Free's ""All Right Now,"" and T. Rex's ""Bang a Gong."" It's nowhere near Muzaky enough to desecrate material so unpretentious, but except for Barry Beckett's chunky piano break on ""Bang a Gong"" it doesn't add much, either.
"
FALSE,B,Naked and Warm,Bill Withers,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8157,"
Here Withers returns to the simple ways of his past, working five or six musicians for the kind of hard groove that doesn't have many parallels in black music these days. And almost succeeds in obscuring the continuing dearth of songs--there are only eight here, and the one that runs 10:46, a paean to L.A., includes a couplet about Disneyland that even I, a convert to Withers's plainspeech, find embarrassing every time out. Recommended single: ""Close to Me.""
"
FALSE,B,Now Look,Ron Wood,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8163,"
Just like former Face and co-Ronnie R. Lane, Wood has something English-folk about him. But with Lane it's deliberate--Wood sounds modal because that's the groove his lost pitch instinctively reverts to. This collaboration with producer-composer Bobby Womack is good for one major love song (""I Got Lost When I Found You""), several minor ones, and a lot of melodies that sound familiar when heard again. Just wish they didn't sound so accidental as well--might help me hum 'em.
"
FALSE,B,Giant,The Woodentops,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8652,"
With their ""move away from cynicism"" and airy touch, these Brits do bear a suspicious resemblance to Howard Jones if not Haircut 100, but at their best they're rootsy and rigorous. At their best, in fact, they ring one more change on the less-is-more magic you always think was exhausted the last time. The analogy is Feelies rather than R.E.M.--the lyrical uplift is a function of rave-up alone, with musical and verbal detail extraneous, as the perky/breathy/hooky/romantic distractions of this shot at the big time demonstrate all too well. ""Shout"" and ""Get It On,"" even ""Love Train"" are their mission in life. ""If we could always be together/It would be so sublime"" is Lionel Richie's.
"
FALSE,B,It's Like This,The Woods,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6208,"
No way it can mean much at this late date, but for a first side that never quits Don Dixon's backup trio sound like relaxed late dB's remaking Crazy Horse as Exile on Main Street. Thus it's one of those off-the-cuff pleasures most Amerindies are too self-involved to provide any more, a busman's holiday rather than an artistic statement and/or a career move. On side two the songs run out, which could be why the career move is declined. Lucky thing--even with a dozen songs they'd be riding for a fall.

FALSE,B,Explosion,Betty Wright,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8171,"
Inevitably, she's turning into a warm, perky soul pro, and given how unfashionable simple soul has become we ought to be grateful. But the only times I'm on my knees are on ""I Think I'd Better Think About It,"" in which she resists temptation--to infidelity rather than mere fucking by now--and ""If I Ever Do Wrong,"" in which she thinks some more.

FALSE,B,Footprint,Gary Wright,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8173,"
Like his mentor, George O'Hara, Gary makes his spiritual home right next to his musical one, close by that great echo chamber in the sky. But unlike George he writes anthems that are forthright and tuneful--why, even ""Give Me the Good Earth"" is down-to-earth. The ecology-minded will also approve of ""Love to Survive"" and ""Stand for Our Rights,"" both of which are vague enough to appeal to every constituency. Cosmic-commercial lives.

FALSE,B,The Bottom Line,O.V. Wright,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8175,"
With its unabashedly country (i.e., rural) singer and its back-to-basics Willie Mitchell production, this one has soul nostalgiacs hot and bothered, but I find the material thin and like it mostly for its oddities: the tribute to Guy Lombardo; the sexy mama who refuses to go, as opposed to get, down by declaring, ""I don't do windows""; and the old man who defines love as ""a misunderstanding between two damn fools.""

FALSE,B,Tammy's Greatest Hits Volume II,Tammy Wynette,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8176,"
While no one was looking, that stand-by-your-man gal was writing a female identity song: ""The Only Time I'm Really Me"" (is when I'm asleep--and presumably dreaming). Which is almost cancelled out by one of the most appalling divine justice songs in that godforsaken subgenre: ""The Wonders You Perform"" (at least it's not about her husband). Beyond those two it's the best of the usual--her sultry resignation has archetypal power when the ideology isn't too repellent. It's more archetypal on her first best-of, though.
"
FALSE,B,Womanhood,Tammy Wynette,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8178,"
In which Billy Sherrill performs (or permits) a miracle: five good songs on one side. (Nobody ever accused Bily of thinking big.) On side one, we learn about virtue sorely tempted, the limits of sisterhood, music as emotional communion, virtue abandoned, and the limits of professionalism. On side two, Tammy confuses Wolfman Jack with John the Baptist and then retreats into the commonplace. With country albums, you take what you can get.
"
FALSE,B,Ain't Love Grand,X,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8658,"
After five years of wresting art from commerce and/or vice versa, John and Exene try to have it both ways. Satisfying their bohemian urges with the neofolk Knitters on the art label Slash, they appease their major mentors and keep Billy in the band by taking X to the same producer as Christian heavy metal boys Stryper. Only just as you'd figure, Michael Wagener can't make John and Exene (or even Billy) sound commercial enough to convert anyone. On the first side he has trouble making them sound like anything at all.

FALSE,B,See How We Are,X,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8659,"
Even during the first four songs, when the sustained detail of the writing--with a boost from Dave Alvin's tormented yet unembittered ""4th of July""--makes it seems they'll fight for every inch, you miss Billy Zoom's syncretic junk: fine though he is, Tony Gilkyson is too neoclassy for these convinced vulgarians. Then the material devolves into complaints, throwaways, wasted stanzas, and utter clinkers.

Remember when Difford &amp; Tilbrook were writing a musical? Sounds like a job for Partridge &amp; Moulding. They could name it after ""The Everyday Story of Smalltown."" Which would keep them working at the proper scale and be the best thing for steam-powered trains since Ray Davies.

The problem with received tropes about love and music isn't that they're a turnoff in themselves--finally, I don't care what the words of ""Don't Stop the Music"" are, and the same goes for ""Crazy"" and ""Third Degree,"" which continue side one. But when the settings are undistinguished, as on side two, only very great singers can attract one's interest the way a good lyric might. Y&amp;P are very good singers.

Alf Moyet may not have as ""good"" a voice as Annie Lennox, but she's more fun to spend half an hour with--cut her and she bleeds, etc. A bit of an old romantic, though, which really isn't that much better than the new kind.

FALSE,B,Everybody Knows,Trisha Yearwood,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5809,"
Tricia had a dream, and by 1985 she was in Nashville pursuing it--studying ""music business,"" as her bio says, at Belmont College. An internship and some demo singing later, she had signed with MCA, where she now epitomizes the blandness of today's quality country. Not that she's bad or anything. Her voice is big and precise, and she ends up with a good song or two on every album--including this one, where she doesn't ruin strong titles by Kevin Welch and Steve Goodman and brings off a terrific Matraca Berg line about chocolate and magazines. But if songwriters love her so much, it must be because she brings nothing to the song but what they put there. The same cannot be said of Willie Nelson, George Jones, Reba McEntire, Garth Brooks--even Shania Twain. In pop music, good taste isn't timeless. It's boring.
"
FALSE,B,Fragile,Yes,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4240,"
I certainly prefer Yes's rock-classical synthesis--in which tricky intros, swooping dynamics, and intense textures are integrated into a self-sustaining (and -propelling) electric framework--to ELP's flashy chopsmanship. ""Round-About"" is a triumph right down to its nature-mystic lyric, the rhythm players each contribute a viable composition, Steve Howe remains a marvel, and even the rearranged Brahms from new keyboard player Rick Wakeman is tolerable. But isn't there supposed to be more to art than great contrivance?

FALSE,B,Guitars Cadillacs Etc. Etc.,Dwight Yoakam,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1105,"
As seems retrospectively inevitable in the neoclassicist era, a major finally gave this bluegrass-tinged hardshell a shot, expanding his generous indie EP of the same title (on Oak, if you care to look) into a skimpy album. Even first time around his twang-power purism was more retreat than reclamation. Add two superfluous covers, a duet with Maria McKee, and a title tune in which all those et ceteras turn out to be ""hillbilly music"" and you get Ricky Skaggs for sinners.

If Young's voice weren't as gruffly workaday as his guitar, he might be a threat--he's got a knack for the blues subject, from mama-in-law to barbecue to what money can buy. Even with the stupid string synthesizer butting in, this is a solid, coverable groove album. And the Johnnie Taylor medley kicks it off naturally.

FALSE,B,Old Ways,Neil Young,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8669,"
In a pathetic attempt to convince the world he makes a difference in the record business, Warners touts this as his country move, but he doesn't and it's not. He's been making country moves ever since ""Oh Lonesome Me"" without once showing any flair for the literal narrative and pungent sentimentality the country audience goes for, though his modestly engaging melodies are the equal of any Music Row tunesmith's. So what you get when he's on is a catchy ditty that starts off like an utter clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but soon jogs a litt""Old Ways"" are divided into bad (substance abuse) and not so bad (workaholism). ""Are There Any More Real Cowboys?"" hails ""workin' families"" who resist encroaching developers, ""Bound for Glory""'s trucker abandons wife and kids for a hard-lovin' hitchhiker with new ideas and a dog.

FALSE,B,Life,Neil Young & Crazy Horse,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8670,"
The autobiography of a loose cannon starts things off with a bang, proving once and for all that this furriner should volunteer his literary services to the Central Intelligence Agency, where surrealistic inconsistency and casual racism are hallmarks of every cover story. Then there are the reflections on liberty (war?) and fashion (terrorism?) and a heroine from that bygone epoch when dusky-skinned peoples had natural nobility going for them. After which he turns the record over to riff on ""Too lonely to fall in love"" and toss off some mournful tunes and get his garage band to caterwaul ""That's why we don't want to be good."" Make no mistake, there's plenty of life left in the son of a bitch. Which should surprise no one who believes it.

FALSE,B,Colossal Youth,Young Marble Giants,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4253,"
What a modern romance--two brothers, a girl, and a rhythm machine. I'd call it cult music of the year, only cults inspire evangelical enthusiasm, and what their fans like is not getting excited about something--finally, after too much noise and three-chord thrash. With Alison Statton's fragile leads unthreatened by guitar, bass, organ, or rhythm machine, and Stuart Moxham's lyrics your basic Mensa applications, they're nothing more and nothing less than robot folkies. So call it cult muzak of the year--quiet, tuneful, passing weird.

FALSE,B,Waka/Jawaka--Hot Rats,Frank Zappa,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8193,"
With Sal Marquez playing ""many trumpets"" all over ""Big Swifty,"" there are times you could drop the needle and think you were listening to recent Miles Davis. That's certainly what Zappa's been doing. But where Davis is occasionally too loose, Zappa's always too tight--he seems to perceive only what is weird and alienating in his influences, never what is humane. Also, Sal Marquez doesn't play trumpet(s) as good as Miles.

FALSE,B,Bongo Fury,Frank Zappa/Captain Beefheart/The Mothers,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8198,"
This sentimental reunion album, recorded (where else?) in Austin with (what else?) additional L.A. studio work, is dismissed by Zappaphiles and 'Fhearthearts alike, but what were they expecting? Perhaps because there's a blues avatar up top, the jazzy music has a soulful integrity, and though it's embarrassing to hear the Captain deliver Frankie's latest pervo exploitations, the rest of the songs are funnier because he's singing them.

FALSE,B,Zvuki Mu,Zvuki Mu,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6212,"
Described by an admirer as ""a witty drunkard, wild dancer and failed poet,"" Peter Mamonov is also an old-fashioned beatnik, with woman problems to match: ""Yesterday you gave yourself to me/And now you think I owe you,"" ""just don't thrust yourself upon me with your endless meals."" These he recreates in a wild and witty way, complete with hypnotic cabaret-rock (or something). Like a lot of glasnost culture, he has his retro attractions--in his own language, the quarter-truths of his boho sexism give off a pleasant shock. But like a lot of beatniks, he can't resist experiments that aren't as avant-garde as he thinks they are.

FALSE,B,The Best of ZZ Top,ZZ Top,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8204,"
""10 Legendary Texas Tales,"" the cover claims, but that's another tall one. ""Jesus Just Left Chicago"" is more like it--these boys obviously believe that even sonsofgod get the blues. And by concentrating all their favorite steals in one place come up with a not-bad boogie album that can stand in for five lousy ones. High point: ""Tush"" (hey, I thought that was Jewish).

FALSE,B,Afterburner,ZZ Top,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8680,"
With sales on Eliminator over five mil almost by accident, this hard-boogieing market strategy is defined by conscious commercial ambition--by its all but announced intention of making ZZ the next Bruce/Madonna/Prince/Michael, with two beards and a Beard at every checkout counter. The Trevor Hornish synth touches and out-front hooks are clues, but the proof is ""Rough Boy,"" an attempted top-five ballad that would sound like pure take-me-or-leave-me revved up. And in case you think they've lost their sense of humor, there's a new dance called the ""Velcro Fly."" I'm laughing, I'm laughing.
