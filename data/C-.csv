FALSE,C-,Reckless,Bryan Adams,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4291,"
The megabuck stops here. Maybe I'll let Bruce Springsteen teach me how to hear John Cougar Mellencamp, but damned if I'm going to let John Cougar Mellencamp teach me how to hear Bryan Adams. From antipunkdiscowave strut to Flashdance homage, he's a generic American hunk, only whiter because he's Canadian. Where Sammy Hagar flaunts his anticommunism and Don Henley flaunts his mouth, Adams flaunts nothing more and nothing less than his young reliable bod. Like all the above-mentioned good and bad he shares a mysterious nostalgia for the recent past with a lot of people who aren't half dead yet, at least chronologically. And more than any of them he has real problems relaxing, which puts him square in the soul-as-will-and-idea tradition of Lou Gramm, Pat Boone, Sophie Tucker, and so many others.

FALSE,C-,Seed,Afro Celts,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12192,"
Another U.K. band Americans don't need--musically, we're all Afrocelts, and uilleann pipes have nothing to do with it. Not that they have much to do with this oleaginous fusion unit, where a predictable surfeit of Celts--or at least white people, given headman Simon Emmerson's highly Anglo-Saxon surname--have long favored electronics and such pan-world signifiers as bouzouki, tabla, and flamenco guitar. Right, the aim is spiritual deep down--a way for Wiccans who only go to church on Halloween to get in touch with their inner shamans. So two Africans beat their ""tribal drums,"" as one admiring review ID'd them, while Emmerson and a late Pogue and a formerly Gaelic-only vocalist position themselves alongside a kora player whose hometown in Guinea has been electrified by a portion of their earnings. Next they should chip in some samplers. Music may come of this yet.

FALSE,C-,Hunting High and Low,A-Ha,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4304,"
Quite aware that I don't qualify as a pubescent female, I tried to be understanding. It's not their fault they're blond, after all--they're Norwegian. But though they'd clearly have been better off raised closer to the blues--in Wales, say--the gutturals of fellow Scandinavians from Gasolin' to the Nomads suggest that their precious Yes-gone-Europop accents are chosen freely. Over music they probably exerted less control.

FALSE,C-,History/America's Greatest Hits,America,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6305,"
Randy Newman once described ""A Horse With No Name"" as ""this song about a kid who thinks he's taken acid,"" and at least back then they were domesticating CSNY instead of CSN. More tuneful than Seals &amp; Crofts but with less to say, which they've managed to conceal by establishing meaningless highschool verse as a pop staple, they might be remembered as the '70s answer to the Association if they could come up with one song half as lively as ""Windy"" or ""Along Comes Mary.""

The art-rock Foreigner is a find--rare that a big new group is bad enough to sink your teeth into any more. John Wetton and Steve Howe added excitement to contexts as pretentious as King Crimson and Yes, but this is just pompous--schlock in the grand manner, with synthesizers John Williams would love. And after listening to two lyrics about why they like their girlfriends, three about ""surviving,"" and four about why they don't like their girlfriends, I'm ready for brain salad surgery. Inspirational Verse: ""So many lines/You've heard them all/A lie is every one/From men who never understand your personality.""

FALSE,C-,At This Time,Burt Bacharach,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13089,"
When I ask myself which of the many horrible things about this adoringly promoted ""political"" record is the very worst, I'm tempted to go for broke and say the arrangements. For in truth, it is difficult to imagine circumstances under which the pop paragon's latest instrumental divertissements would signify. Chris Botti provides a few high points on trumpet--that's right, Chris Botti, high points, canceled out and then some by the anonymous saxophone soloist, who sounds to my unschooled ears like a moonlighting Kenny G. Then there are the weak yet obtrusive beats hired out to such humanitarians as Kon Artis and Dr. Dre. Rufus Wainwright doesn't really believe ""Love's the answer like I said before/It's the one thing needed maybe now even more,"" Elvis Costello maintains a suspicious distance from ""Who Are These People?"" before belting it with equally suspicious enthusiasm, and both outsing--by a lot--John Pagano (?), Josie James (?), and Donna Taylor (?), who in turn outsing--by a whole lot--chief vocalist Bacharach. Who are these people?

FALSE,C-,Another Journal Entry,Barlow Girl,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13091,"
These three Christian sisters from Illinois specialize in arena-emo love songs to that perfect Guy, who unlike so many guys forgives them when they fail Him. One exception, if I'm not mistaken--and I may be, Christian code is a motherfucker--is ""5 Minutes of Fame,"" apparently a message song for the ""secondary virginity"" movement. Not that they're in need of the secondary kind themselves--they're lucky if ""maybe I gave in more than I should"" (for ""popularity"") recalls anything heavier than a copped feel. Here's hoping they meet Sufjan Stevens at prayer meeting.

This is a little better than the LPs the Gibb brothers came up with during their separation--Cucumber Castle, which at least sold some, and the solo flop Robin's Reign. It does include a bizarre juxtaposition of Jerry Reed imitation and singing strings. But ""Lonely Days"" sounded more distinctive on the radio than it does among its epigones here--the collective vibrato is turning into a grating affectation. Presumably they broke up because they sensed that the formula was getting stale. To try to re-create it yet again is to guarantee the transformation from good commercial group to bad one.
"
FALSE,C-,The London Chuck Berry Sessions,Chuck Berry,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6391,"
Though his backup for this promotion was less than stellar, Chuck Berry finally has an LP on the charts, which is certainly overdue recognition for the number one genius in rock and roll history. Only trouble is, the record is lousy. The live side is Chuck at his hoarsest, and ""My Ding-a-Ling"" isn't even funny the first time. The studio side is pure filler. Buy Chuck Berry's Golden Decade, More Chuck Berry, Chuck Berry's on Top, St. Louis to Liverpool, even Back Home. This doesn't do him justice.

In teen pop as in world music, Gaelic signifies untouched by the tarbrush--Van Morrison, Phil Lynott, and The Commitments notwithstanding. And despite the saucy bits in ""C'est La Vie"" (first a ""You show me yours,"" then an ""I'll blow you [away]""!), this bid to whiten the Spice Girls is so clean you'll be hard-pressed to remember it's there--unless, like me, you get sick to your stomach at Uilleann hooks, mid-Atlantic brogues, and Enya lite. The obligatory rhythmic recitation, yclept ""Freak Out"" and declared ""too hot for hip hop,"" has less bottom than Audrey Hepburn and is over in two minutes. ""Like the Rose,"" unfortunately, takes four.

The worst of the counterculture on a plastic platter--bullshit necromancy, drug-impaired reaction time, long solos, everything. They claim to oppose war, but if I don't believe in loving my enemies I don't believe in loving my allies either, and I've been worried something like this was going to happen since the first time I saw a numerology column in an underground newspaper.

FALSE,C-,Paranoid,Black Sabbath,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6409,"
They do take heavy to undreamt-of extremes, and I suppose I could enjoy them as camp, like a horror movie--the title cut is definitely screamworthy. After all, their audience can't take that Lucifer bit seriously, right? Well, depends on what you mean by serious. Personally, I've always suspected that horror movies catharsized stuff I was too rational to care about in the first place.
"
FALSE,C-,Master of Reality,Black Sabbath,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6410,"
As an increasingly regretful spearhead of the great Grand Funk switch, in which critics redefined GFR as a 1971 good old-fashioned rock and roll band even though I've never met a critic (myself included) who actually played the records, I feel entitled to put this in its place. Grand Funk is like an American white blues band of three years ago--dull. Black Sabbath is English--dull and decadent. I don't care how many rebels and incipient groovies are buying. I don't even care if the band members believe in their own Christian/satanist/liberal murk. This is a dim-witted, amoral exploitation.
"
FALSE,C-,Tear It Up--Live,Black Uhuru,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4406,"
Third album's awful soon for a live one, you might think, and then notice that only one of the eight titles is on Red or Sinsemilla. That's because six of them can be found--in clearer, denser, trickier, scarier, longer versions--on 1979's Showcase, available as a Joe Gibbs import. ""Abortion"" is anti, natch, and Jah knows where they can stick it, but you'd never guess from these remakes how effective it and all Uhuru's early songs can be. Here in Babylon we call this kind of thing a scam.

Just figured out how David Clayton-Thomas learned vocal projection: by belching. That's why when he gets really excited he sounds as if he's about to throw up. But it's only part of the reason he gets me so excited I feel like I'm about to throw up. The whole band commits ""Symphony for the Devil,"" a pretty good rock and roll song revealed as a pseudohistorical middlebrow muddle when suite-ened. And just who added themes by Bartok, Prokofiev, Thelonious, and Fred Lewis (Fred Lewis?) to a Stevie Winwood tune?

Long ago, before he sought institution in David Geffen's tastefully maintained diaspora, David was a nice baby who had grown up. His songs were tortuous and somewhat arty, but they had their strengths. This one sounds like outtakes from the Eagles, all easy rhythms and ladies and outlaws in old Chevrolets.

They sure can play their axes--might even be tolerable as a boogie band. But ""All in the Groove"" is just a classic-rock line. John Popper's interest in fun is strictly rhetorical, and his rhetoric is so prolix I bet they only play three-hour sets so he can get all the words in. I also bet that as a Jack Bruce fan he thinks it's groovy when his rhythm section hustles out more notes than a good groove needs.

FALSE,C-,As Far as I Can See . . .,Colin Blunstone/Rod Argent: The Zombies,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12535,"
""In you I found my Odyssey and Oracle,"" Rod's lyric sheet has Colin emoting, cashing in their long unjustly obscure, now unjustly classic post-breakup album while correcting for the youthful foolishness that makes it sing--in 1968 they ignorantly or pretentiously spelled it ""Odessey."" Where that one was suffused in preemptive nostalgia, this one is soggy with denial. It's full of better ways and flights into the sun, fresh starts on the south side and lives changed by the magic of Memphis (Egypt). Mortality casts its shadow--the April death of bassist Paul Atkinson is all over their longing for renewal. But the dull language deflects death's sting, and the music is craven crap that would have appalled them at 14 or 24--schlock orchestrations, socko choruses, showtime overstatements bound for the casino circuit. It's fine, maybe even essential, to assert your vitality as an old man. But imitating the old men you remember from boyhood is an ass-backwards way of doing it.

His imitation of Joe Cocker's Ray Charles imitation is almost OK, but usually he's indistinguishable from pop metal except in the wattage of his guitar parts and the shamelessness of his song doctors.

For years it has been my fond belief that a great rock band could be concocted of studio musicians. Professionals, you dig? Trained to communicate, with no hangups or pretensions. I was wrong because this is that group. It is super competent and super vapid, harmonizing tastefully on one well-executed ""love song"" after another. With a good beat, of course. If Crosby, etc. are the Limeliters of rock--and they are--then these guys are the Lettermen.

I am no expert on gospel music, but I have noticed two basic types: small group, which is like rock and roll, and chorale, which is like Hugo Winterhalter. Despite some nice instrumentation, this is in the second category. The unimaginative selection of songs is sung with a lot of soul, natch'ly, but with no discernible conviction.

Take a fad that has already peaked--punk-rock, say--and then trick it up with a gimmick that is simultaneously corny and outre, like dressing your group in roller derby outfits. Make sure the music is crummy. Then hand over your record company to David Geffen so you can goof off seriously.

Fast heavy metal, of course, a little too classy for satanism or even blatant sexism, but who cares when what we get from the Nietzsche Sales reads on the cover is ""Only the Strong (Will Survive)"" in ""A World Gone Wild."" The secret, as in most bands great and ghastly, is the man with the concept: singer and songwriter Michael Des Barres (ex-Silverhead), whose ""daddy was an aristocrat,"" and who's been ruining rock and roll in a vain attempt to prove that that makes him special for close to a decade.

I'm not claiming actually to have listened to this four-record set--you think I'm a nut?--but the event is too overwhelming to ignore altogether, and Chicago is a C-minus group if ever I heard one. Anyway, the packaging offers textual support for my opinion. The shrink-wrap is so loose that many Christmas gift recipients are going to suspect their girlfriends of buying review copies. And the lack of paper sleeves inside the cardboard sleeves inside the big box means that the only way to avoid scratching these plastic documents is to put the whole shebang out on the coffee table and never touch it again.

Eric was never the nonsinger he was wont to declare himself in retiring moments, but his vocal gift only made sense when laidback was commercial. On this album he isn't retiring--he's looking for work. So he resorts to none other than Phil Collins, once his Brit-rock opposite but now just a fellow ""survivor"" (and how). For several reasons, including market fashion, Collins mixes the drums very high. This induces Eric to, um, project in accordance with market fashion. Sad. And also bad.

OK, they're a bit more proficient than most ""tight"" ""new wave"" bands. But Lee Abrams himself couldn't hear a hit here. So how'd they get their blue vinyl and blue-ribbon executive producers--both Lenny Waronker and Russ Titelman? Well, Dean Chamberlain works a&amp;r for Warners, and real producer Michael Ostin's dad Mo is an even bigger wig at Warners than the aforementioned. I'd never call this process deplorable per se--like pols' kids Vietnamizing their dads in the '60s, somebody has to punk up the biz's sires, and tandem tyro Paul Wexler did Tin Huey a solid that way. In this particular case, however, the outcome isn't even cute or catchy enough to dismiss as skinny-tie music--although the drummer does wear one, just in case.

A remarkable percentage of female singer-songwriters resemble movie stars, at least on their album jackets, which makes me wonder whether companies sign them because they sing and write.

Since the three women who comprise this group are avowed feminists in a time of blatant reaction, I found it hard to admit to myself how much I hated them at first. I hate them. Their music is squeaky-clean folk-rock, their humor the smug folkie sarcasm that seems to have its roots in junior high school talent shows.

If I read my copy of Clive correctly, the eternally youthful Leitch received $250,000 for this LP, on which he (forthrightly) refers to himself as a ""well known has-been"" and (slowly) thinks up reasons why the planet should adjust to his mental reflexes, thusly: ""Slow Down World--Take a Break for God's Sake."" Saith Clive: ""If He's willing to make a few commercial concessions, any album of his could be a major reentry."" So I guess these ain't those.

FALSE,C-,What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits,The Doobie Brothers,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6740,"
The quotation originated with Seneca and is very impressive, though one wonders (as one is no doubt supposed to) just what vices-turned-habits are indicated. Ordinary music? Or something even more enervating? After all, boogie chillen, wouldn't it have a better beat if it were phrased ""what once were vices now are habits""? Oh well--unlike Three Dog Night, who they would do well to emulate, they've never shown any flair with outside material.

FALSE,C-,Rio,Duran Duran,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4693,"
With music drily electronic enough to pass for new wave and pop moistly textural enough to go over as pop, lyrics that rearrange received language from several levels of discourse into a noncommital private doggerel, and a limitless supply of Bowie clones to handle the vocal chores, this is Anglodisco at its most solemnly expedient. It lacks even the forced cheerfulness of (whatever happened to?) Haircut 100 (wait, I don't really want to know), as if it had as many hooks as A Flock of Seagulls (not bloody likely) it still wouldn't be silly enough to be any fun.

Dylan is Bob, the influential singer-songwriter who's resurfaced as the brains of the Traveling Wilburys; the Dead are Grateful, and not just because charismatic guitarist-antileader Jerry Garcia survived an offstage coma--they're rich men, and they sound it. Like Dylan, Garcia plays hardest and works most playfully when somebody pokes him a little--Ornette Coleman, say. But unlike Ornette, Dylan's not forever young, and what he makes of his catalogue here is exactly what he's been making of it for years--money.

On the hit, mellow electrobeat and Gregorian fog provide mutual relief, and the rest of this disco for Camille P. is filler. Some Amurricans think a whispered ""Je te desire"" is por . . . er, erotic--sexy! I've always preferred ""I wanna fuck you"" myself.

Metal has evolved at such a drastic pace that this assiduously inoffensive prefab seems almost folkloric, a weird anachronism in which the great tradition of Jon Bon Jovi and Mark Slaughter--manly tenor, moderate tempos, technically unassailable riffs--is preserved for the dwindling faithful. They ""Reach for the Sky,"" they ""Hold That Dream,"" they ""Rock You Tonight,"" and because their ""Mama Didn't Raise No Fool,"" they describe the inevitable bone job as ""Sleeping With You."" Now isn't that sweet?

People who love Yes will probably like this spinoff and imitation. I find Yes sharp and clever at best and the shapeless and intolerably precious at all times. Nor do I believe music gains body (or sexuality) by capillary action from its cover--the ""advance"" from Yes's psychedoodles to Flash's rear-view crotch shot only make me wonder whether this band comes by its name lysergically.

The contrast of Levi Stubbs's self-indulgence against Motown's economical bottom worked sometimes, although toward the end the breast-beating began to sound like an Olatunji imitation.

Like Steve Miller, Frampton is a medium-snazzy guitarist taking no chances on an absurdly salable formula this time out; the only development from his first (and best) two albums is that this one has a kinda ""live"" feel, and the material is very thin. But at least Frampton sounds completely unsmug, an achievement in a star of his magnitude.

Now permit me to refrain from listing the titles from which the title track is constructed. Dull even when he isn't describing his medical problems, this no-talent is masscult rock at its most brazen, as certain to fall as Tom DeLay (meaning it looks that way and I hope the fuck).

Well, let's see, a quick survey of the relevant ones: guitar plugged into telephone, forty-five on tape deck, calendar opened to November 31, copy of People with Gold on the cover, and this record, with its borrowed life--anyone can make ""Doo Wah Diddy Diddy"" sound OK--and authentic self-pity.

Gold is Barry Manilow in a flannel shirt, and that the cover depicts him in white tie only compounds the offense. Who but the ultimate session men would sing such I'm-OK lyrics in a blues-country pop-slop style so unfettered by details of personality? In early 1977, after Elektra/Asylum made music history by raising the list price of the new Queen LP 14 percent, E/A prexy Steve Wax defended the move in terms of development capital--the profits from Queen were needed to support the label's uncommercial artists. One of Wax's examples: Andrew Gold. Who do you suppose will be promoted with the profits from Gold's $7.98 LP? The fusioneers of the label's new ""jazz"" line? Or Warren Zevon?

I guess I turn in my Free Grand Funk button, because I think this declaration of independence from the dastardly Terry Knight continues their two-year decline. Especially annoying is Mark Farner's singing, which combines the worst of Jack Bruce with the worst of Eddie Fisher, but the music--including Craig Frost's organ--isn't what you'd call dynamic.

Personally, I've always thought sucking was fun, but I know people intend an insult when they say disco sucks, and this is the kind of preprogrammed pap they're thinking of. Most of it has as much emotional substance as the soundtrack to Integrated Beach Party--here the background music for the boisterous-barbecue sequence, there the accompaniment for the gentle-fuck scene. This does feature a nice post-doowop vocal on ""Happiness Togetherness"" (what am I supposed to call it, fifth cut first side?), and ""The Groove Line"" does its filthy work as fast as a Dr. Pepper jingle, but only on the title cut do the layered rhythms and harmonies get interesting, the way good disco should. And surprise: this is not a hit on the disco circuit.

On his last album, in CD-cusp 1989, six out of 10 tracks ran over five minutes; on this one, it's nine out of 13, with two others clocking in at 4:49 and 4:50. Since my own suspicions have been on record since the Eagles conquered the air, believe my formerly sympathetic California buddy Greil Marcus in Salon: ""While it's well known that as one gets older, one tends to find changes in the world at large unsettling, confusing, fucking irritating, a rebuke to one's very existence, it's generally not a good idea to make a career out of saying so.""

It may seem unfair to judge a band on a live double, but they go out of their way to define themselves with this seven-song job, which celebrates the ascendancy of ruff 'n' tuff Steve Marriott over wan 'n' gone Peter Frampton by raunching up blues and soul titles too magnificent to mention in such company. Lotsa getdown vocals, lotsa getdown guitar, and an important political message, which is that short guys get laid more than normal people. A lie.

The title of a mildly enjoyable schlock single--which somehow got little FM play even though Jim Peterik does an amazing David Clayton-Thomas imitation--is also the title of a properly schlocky follow-up LP.

If Idol's interest in William Gibson's uncopyrightable neologism was originally piqued by the dollar signs that appear in front of his eyes whenever he encounters the magic rune p-u-n-k, well, the fate of any good idea is that sooner or later it touches people with no deep connection to it--like punk itself and the former William Broad, for instance. Not that Idol would think of offending this new generation he's read about. So ""Adam in Chains,"" which after a long spoken intro devolves into what a vulgarian might take for his latest love-gone-bad rant, is in fact ""a prayer for the tomorrow people and powerjunkies."" And the deathless ""Suck on my love meat"" is intended as a critique, not a celebration. Sexist, our Billy? How cyber would that be?

As he turns 35, the 5's original teenthrob undertakes to fill little brother's shoes. Having dominated songwriting as well as lead vocals on the family's 2300 Jackson Street, a perky piece of disposable pop-funk that failed to go gold, he's forced to hand-pick black-crossover hacks from Surface to David Z on his (huxtry, huxtry) ""first solo album in over 3 years."" A mild-voiced journeyman whose heyday is 10 if not 20 years behind him, he's equally bland as love man (title hit promises they can still be friends) and stud (though he does thank six foals on the back cover). Docked a notch not just for muttering, ""Hey baby, I'd like to buck you,"" but for having some hired b-boy chime in with the requisite ""Word.""

Slick James, the P-Funk propaganda ministry calls him, but on his getting-laid album Slick Lame is more like it. After limping onto the set with the quasi-uptempo ""Bit Time"" (""And I know success is all mine""), he makes with the free-love smarm, returning to what he calls funk only on the climactic ""Mary-Go-Round,"" which takes a utilitarian view of a woman who lives the free-love life.

Worth ignoring while she was merely precious, she demands our brief attention now that she's becoming overvalued as well. With the possible exception of Saint Joan, who at least had some stature, this is the bad folkie joke to end all bad folkie jokes. With her self-righteousness, her self-dramatization, her abiding love for her own voice, her breathy little-girl innocence and breathless baby-doll sexuality, her useless ideas about prejudice and injustice and let us not forget abuse, she may well prove as insufferable as any hollow-bodied guitarist ever to get away with craving the world's adoration.

""The cynical few,"" by which Howard appears to mean people who can think, will detect in the very title of this revolving self-help manual a hint of what the German cynic Nietzsche called ressentiment. No special interests here, folks, because all of us--male and female, rich and poor, white and other, top of the pops and glued to the telly--are in the same human boat. You think you have problems, even enemies? Think again: ""And if they were not meant to be/Well don't you think they wouldn't be""? Howard's music, up-to-date synthpopbeat featuring a human voice that may well belong to Howard himself, reflects his acceptance of the known world by adding not a thing to it. Here's hoping he changes his head sometime soon--he sure could use a new one.

When last seen they were onstage at Carnegie Hall, reading that stanza about writers and critics from ""The Times They Are A-Changin',"" and despite the title this is obviously their stab at artistic respectability, less The Knack's Second Album than Commander Chapman's Nasty Mouths Club Band. Or maybe they understand what critics don't: that little girls think it's cute and sexy to write songs about Mexican guys pimping their wives to Jewish guys. What critics understand and they don't--or maybe they're just so close to satori that they accept their limitations--is that whatever the subject, little girls prefer catchy, punchy second-hand songs to varied, indecisive thirdhand ones. In fact, so do critics.

The most inconsistent of Gladys's albums with the Pips offered frequent glimmers of the soul in the middle of the road, but this solo shot is dreary. Not only is it markedly duller than The One and Only . . . , supposedly her farewell to the Pips, but it's also less interesting than Callin', the second album by the Pips along together. I assume producer Gary Klein arranged the switch from New York soul session guys, who have their moments, to El Lay schlock-pop session guys, who don't. So he and second-stringer Tony Macaulay (why he have three songs on this album? why he produce them?) will do as scapegoats. But is it their fault she says ""little one"" instead of ""little wog"" on a version of ""Sail Away"" in which the slave trader's gently humorous persona recalls the narrator of ""Try to Remember""? And was it they who saddled her with the Jim Gilstrap Singers, soon to change their name to the Paps? Even her summer TV show was more fun than this.

It says something for these funk pioneers that unlike James Brown, George Clinton, and the Ohio Players they've adapted painlessly, nay profitably, to disco: a number-one single leads their Deodato-produced album into the top ten. What it says is that their funk was as bland as you suspected. Even the number-one single is disco as transformed not by funksters (cf. ""(not just) Knee Deep"" or even ""The Original Disco Man"") but by bizzers (cf. ""Fame"" or even ""Guilty"")--disco without a cult, which means without a loyal audience either.

If in 1973 I'd been told that thirteen years hence Casey Kasem would name a then ghettoized funk group as the top singles act of the '80s, my heart would have swelled until my head interjected that the top singles act of the '70s was the Osmond family. In this I would have been wise, and if I'd then been told that the secret of Kool's success would be a bland black singer named James Taylor, I would have observed that he couldn't possibly be worse than our white one. In this I could have been unduly optimistic.

The cover depicts a frightened little girl peering up from a swing at a hook-handed rapist whose huge shadow slants across her space; the girl's shadow seems to hang from the gallows-shaped K of the band logo. They love this image, exploit it in every trade ad as Sony flogs their death-industrial into its second year. They sing about child abuse, too--guess what, they're agin it. But if their name isn't short for kiddie porn, they should insist on a video where they get eaten by giant chickens.

Hans Fenger was a gifted teacher on a mission. Cutting keepsake vinyl for his kiddie choir was a great way for him to reward past involvement while inspiring more. Irwin Chusid is a tedious ideologue with a hustle. Turning that vinyl into a collectible CD is the latest way for him to remind the converted that artistic intention is reserved for the beholder in these postmodern times--especially if the beholder has a hustle. A few of these songs were great, a few of them sucked, and every one was more innocent and/or desperate in its original version except Barry Manilow's (but not the Bay City Rollers'). A special annoyance is the reportedly tear-jerking ""Desperado"" by a 10-year-old who doesn't seem to have any idea what the song means, which is to her credit as a human being but not as a singer. The sole revelation is Brian Wilson, whose six songs still sound like themselves.

I've liked this woman on record with Neil Young and on stage with Commander Cody, but her solo debut is the worst kind of backup-chick garbage, pure El Lay from its folk-pop production to its Sam Cooke desecration and J.D.

Drolly self-deprecating anti-folkie covers iconic anarcho-punk Purists for ultraleft analysis in musical form--that's just what this reeling world could use, you'd think. And indeed, it's not altogether stupid. But it's also hate-filled and hateful--not just the Crass, but second-generation beatnik Lewis, who like most hereditary bohemians was brought up to think he's better than normal people. However well he understands capitalist exploitation, his emotional response is stunted: ""I hate the living dead and their work in factories/They go like sheep to their production lines."" (""Like sheep""--what a cool image!) Historically, people in this economy have taken what they can get and had some fun in their spare time. They like Sarah Palin because they know she's as smart as Jeffrey Lewis and suspect they're not all that far behind themselves.

Exemplifying the pitfalls of the mixtape hustle is this item, which I bought blind from Amazon earlier in the year; it has now disappeared there, while mixtape king and sometime Weezy packager DJ Khaled's different CD of the same name remains on sale. Biggest problem with this one is, it isn't a Lil Wayne record. With four features and some cameos, he clocks fewer minutes on these 25 tracks than not just New Orleans rap daddy Birdman but Atlanta's carrot-nosed Young Jeezy and two of the dullest thugs in the lying business: college-educated Miami brutalist Rick Ross and elephant in the Bronx Fat Joe. Were Wayne to toss off ""I am a professional/I will cut your testicles,"" he'd sound wicked sharp; when Fat Joe recites the line, of which he's plainly very proud, even the opera sample can't dispel the impression that he's hoping to find employment as a veterinarian's assistant. While everybody else's criminal boasts are delivered in bench-press mode, Wayne can't stop dancing. Sure he'll entertain at ""The Crack House,"" but: ""This is the crack house welcome to the crack house/Man I'm talking more parties than a frat house/This is the problem, this is not music/I hope you find it, 'cause he about to lose it.""

Arthur Lee has made a good career out of anticipating and capitalizing on ideas that were natural to other people. Sometimes, as on his best Jagger imitations and most of the Forever Changes studio effects, he has seemed an almost transcendantly pop figure, and he has always written interesting songs.

Fearing serial tsunamis of subcosmic truism and womanist gush, I'd always kept away from the edge of this Canadian, such as it was. But between her Lilith Fair counterpalooza and ""Building a Mystery"" bonanza, I had to dive in, and got less than I'd bargained for. McLachlan isn't a mystic, a sister, even a NewAger--merely a singer-songwriter of monumental banality. Now ensconced in the mature satisfactions that come eventually to many unhappy young women, most of whom don't possess a clear multioctave voice or modest tune sense, she's proud to encase her homilies of succor and self-acceptance in settings that don't call undue attention to her compositional ambitions. Renormalized pop at its most unnecessary.

The title cut is the great novelty song that may be about the death of rock and roll or may be about its refusal to die. The other material here indicates that McLean himself believes the former, but since it also indicates that he couldn't have composed ""American Pie""--he just took dictation from the shade of Buddy Holly, who must be taking some pretty strong drugs up there to make such a mistake--you might as well judge for yourself. And do so like a real novelty-lover, by buying the single--unless you're in the market for a song about how nobody understood Van Gogh.

Here's where the pimple comes to a head--if this isn't adolescent angst in its death throes, then Buddy Holly lived his sweet, unselfconscious life in vain. The lyrics offer wit amid heat and power (will ""lyric-sheet verse"" soon turn into the macho converse of ""greeting-card verse""?) and the music pulls out the stops quite knowingly (will Phil Spector soon be remembered as the Rachmaninoff of rock and roll?). Occasionally it seems that horrified, contemptuous laughter is exactly the reaction this production team intends, and it's even possible that two percent of the audience will get the joke. But the basic effect is grotesquely grandiose. Bruce Springsteen, beware--this is what you've wrought, and it could happen to you.

I can't deny it because I catch myself grinning--distanced by the years, and with the campy kicks magnified by a heightened awareness of Freddie Mercury's sexuality, the music of Queen has accrued the high gloss of committed kitsch, where that of Journey, say, has assumed the dull shapelessness of utter crap. Although I don't enjoy all of Classic Queen or Queen's Greatest Hits--the material's not quite that deep--they're often funny and they're also pop, oddly reminiscent of top-grade Cheap Trick. So lest anyone suspect me of sentimentalizing the dead, let me isolate this resurrected cult item, proof that you don't have to be homophobic to hate opera fantasies. Mercury's voice, unnecessarily strong and pure by rock standards, sounds like a ragged old thing up against that of a true diva well past her prime, while the diva trips over the elementary rhythmic demands of the Brian May-less material, which imparts new meaning to the concept of not quite that deep.

""Singers get all the pussy,"" the fledgling songwriter and vocalist observed on his last album, devoted to the comedy for which he is best known. ""You sing, women go crazy."" Poor guy, is he that hard up? Or is it just that like all comedians he longs to prove that he's not as nasty as we know him to be in his finest moments? Well, women aren't gonna take him on down because he sings like this--his voice is so thin that in the end Rick James (""Comedians get all the pussy. You crack a joke, women fall into bed with you"") wastes his best track in years on it. And though Stevie Wonder donates two songs, Murphy doesn't bring out his Stevie impression except on his own ""I, Me, Us, We,"" which as a result is the strongest piece of music here. It also typifies the one-worlder cheerleading of a lyricist who can't be as bright as we'd hoped him to be in his finest moments--he's got politics like Jerry Lewis, only with less soul.

If anyone can write a rock ballad to a deposed Russian princess made famous by Ingrid Bergman it's Murphy--the image sums up the F. Scott Fitzgerald/Rhett Butler (and Eva Braun?) side of a boy-man who's also heir to the traditional reverence for Jimi Hendrix and James Dean. Instead, the song is the embarrassing epitome of a record on which Murphy sounds spoiled instead of sensitive, presumptuous instead of ambitious, and about as comfortable with rock and roll as Roderick Falconer.

The title is as phony as the rest of the album, which despite the paid-for goodies--harmony here, intro there, even a song somewhere or other--is a tame collection of reshuffled platitudes.

Last time the offhand, dreamy mythos of the originals seemed designed for the thin, dreamy pathos of the voices, and even then the combination didn't wear very well except as pastoral Muzak.

The ""Schm"" is for schmaltz, to which this is a tribute--the selections, none of which were written after 1958, include ""For Me and My Gal"" and ""I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now."" Theoretically, this is a charming idea--who among us is better equipped to bring such music back to life? Actually, it's soporific--devoid of humor or irony but without any rediscovery of the whole-hearted emotion on which the old songs are predicated. Nilsson doesn't sing with much power and Gordon Jenkins's charts don't even qualify as period pieces. I know, I'm just a dumb rock and roll fan, so go waste your money. I wouldn't give my extra copy to my mother.

They're certainly realer than the Backstreet Boys. But no way does that guarantee they're as good. Their mild singing is soulful only because there's no competent pop that isn't anymore. Their goopy hit ballad has nothing on a little something called ""Heaven's Missing an Angel.""

Too used and abused to pursue their business interests, the self-appointed ""real niggaz"" watched other fake gangstas climb the charts till they could bear it no more. So they threw together this $6.98-list shortie and hoped Amerikkka would want it. Their best riff of 1988 is their best riff of 1990, attached to a blaxploitation docudrama pitting fake gangstas against fake cops (probably played by members of their management team). And for that 2 Live touch they hire a woman (as we'll call her) to mouth their instructions on cocksucking technique, one of many things they don't know dick about. To wit: first ""grab"" (ouch); then ""lick"" (just twice, before you get down to bidness); then ""insert"" (now ""take it slow""); and ""before you know it"" (damn soon), ""splash.""

This is supposed to be where they finally slam nonstop. In fact, however, the music's just like the lyrics--market-ready. Catchy, yes, and funky in its laid-back electro way, but never hard enough to scare off the novelty audience. Which might be fun if they didn't outpig the LAPD in the bargain. Can Chuck D really believe they mean what they say? Sure they really hate women, and anybody else who looks at them funny. But unless they're even sicker than they seem, they're too greedy to murder anybody as long as they can make so much money fronting about it. And so they've calculated every rhyme to push somebody's button--to serve up the thrill of transgression to ghettobound and merely ghettocentric young-black-males, and also to the big score, culturally deprived white boys seeking exotic role models. That kids will take them at their word obviously doesn't concern niggaz who'll be hard-pressed to contain their pent-up hostility after the bubble bursts. It'd be nice to think they'll off each other when that great day comes, but I doubt they have the balls. So in the interests of public safety, pray they don't get taken by their investment advisors.

The three best-selling record albums of all time are Tapestry, Bridge Over Troubled Water, and The Sound of Music. One way of explaining how unmonolithic ""mass"" culture really is is to point out how few consumers are likely to own all three. And a way of explaining how stupefying Jane Olivor is is to guess that she not only owns all three, but would put them in her all-time top 10. Live, she enunciates Neil Diamond and John Denver lyrics with the intense credulity of someone who thinks poetry is anything that rhymes; her LP is marginally adventurous, but if she becomes a star it will be by embodying the half of Barbra Streisand that Bette Midler put in the garbage. Recycling should never go this far.

As a country singer, Reed sustains three identities: crazy, picker, soap idol. He's a great crazy, as the title song demonstrates. And he's an all right picker, if you like pickers. But he couldn't sell soap to a hippie's mother. RCA should ban the ballad. I can imagine an A record called The Crazy Jerry Reed, but this one is docked a notch for time: 27.35.

If you want to explore ""the politics of feeling good,"" a correct enough program, then make people feel good first. Avoid ""carbon copies of the same old lines.""

FALSE,C-,Come In and Burn,Rollins Band,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5210,"
Success doesn't suit this drug addict, who will kick caffeine only when they synthesize rage itself. Since I got big yucks out of 1992's spoken-word twofer The Boxed Life, which recalled a lab-assistant job and other homely pursuits, I am entitled to grouse about the grim star diary that is 1997's spoken-word twofer Black Coffee Blues. And while it's no surprise that this thrash-and-churn is his metalest metal ever, it's amazing that Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen made Rollins their flagship rocker--for all his corp clout and cult cred, he was off the charts a month after he muscled on. As pathetic as it is for aging Spinal Taps to fabricate melodrama out of an adolescent despair they remember via groupies and fan mail, it's even more pathetic never to feel anything else.

Especially given the rich little rich girl's South African connection, I ignored this airless atrocity--lots of bad records sell, and parents do need X-mas gifts. But when it scored in my own critics' poll I could remain silent no longer. Forget phrasing, interpretation, or--God knows from someone who had trouble rocking ""Heat Wave""--swing. All Ronstadt does with these fine-to-middling pop standards is stifle them beneath her moderately gorgeous voice. Her triumph is conceptual--genteel neoconservatives, kneejerk pluralists, one-upping convolutionists, and out-and-out ignoramuses all get off on the idea of a ""rock"" performer validating the prerock values such songs signal. And may every one of them wear a tie, a garter belt, or both for the rest of their shrinking lives.

Don't let misguided feminism, critical convolutions, or the fact that good punk transcends ordinary notions of musicality tempt you. This is Kim Fowley's project, which means that it is tuneless and wooden as well as exploitative. How anyone can hang around El Lay so long without stealing a hook or two defies understanding. Maybe it's just perversity--which would make it the only genuinely perverse thing about the man.

I never quite got Leon's point back in the days of mad dogs and superstars, so you'll forgive me for having allowed his very first Kim Fowley collaboration to slip off the charts (from a high of 110 in Record World) before it reached my turntable. Turns out to be notable as a real con artists' summit--there's a tribute to ""Elvis and Marilyn"" that is now being distributed in verse form, a soap opera called ""Housewife"" that panders so ecumenically it's been covered by Wayne Newton, and a song to Leon's latest agent, Jesus.

It becomes clearer and clearer that these are Dixie dregs indeed. Ringing over the Allmans' inexorable flow, Chuck Leavell's Tyneresque piano chordings used to provide a satisfying simulation of spiritual uplift, but in a fusion I'll take Lonnie Liston Smith (if you can believe that). Nor is Randall Bramblett (even) a Joe Henderson on saxophone. Bramblett does contribute four strong songs. Unfortunately, three are available on his second solo album, Light of the Night, in arrangements that demonstrate conclusively the arbitrariness of these.

Big bands still can't rock, Setzer still can't sing, and that's only the beginning. There is for instance chief arranger Ray Herrmann, Bernard's black-sheep grandnephew, whose dad was 86'd by Stan Kenton because he didn't have any soul. There's the hyperactive desecration visited upon Rosemary Clooney's perky ""This Ole House,"" the croakin' belt an' croon of ""Since I Don't Have You,"" Leiber &amp; Stoller's obscure ""You're the Boss"" retouched so heavy-handedly you'd think Setzer wrote the thing himself. But no, that was--dig these titles!--""This Cat's on a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""Hollywood Nocturne,"" the Elmer Bernstein-influenced ""Switchblade 372."" With its Doc Severinsen blare and Paul Schaffer beats, its gross secondhand nostalgia and showoff guitar, the most preeningly stupid record to mount SoundScan all year.

With funding long at risk in the classical sector--the crooks getting those AIG bonuses are more into Cristal and hotties--Jonathan Meiburg is but one of many trained vocalists seeking his fortune in what is crudely classified pop. And he's had some moments. But on his most acclaimed work of art, his ecological doomshow reaches an apogee and nadir. ""We'll sleep until the world of man is paralyzed,"" croon ""the ambulance men"" in a title tune about piles of dead black birds. I'll leave it to those who care to determine what exactly the birds and ambulance men are doing there. Meiburg's cultivated sweetness bespeaks contempt for the world of man as he perceives it, rendering his projections both dubious and useless, so nertz to him.

Gracie keeps up with the times: in 1974 she called her sludge-rock Manhole, and if her silicon-pop title doesn't have quite as sharp a reverse-sexist twist it's because the ensuing decade has done more for her amour-propre than for her IQ. She demonstrates her usual staunchness of principle with an amazingly dumb piece of satire or something which takes on EKGs and electric blankets but not Linn drums. And is that Gracie singing ""Through the window through the window/I could almost touch the pane""? Rhymes with ""I was in the pouring rain,"" doesn't it?

One of those records--they abound in ""post-rock""--that get nothing but raves because only believers bother to listen. This drone duo met at the University of Texas in 1990; one is now a muso expatriated to Belgium, the other a debate coach expatriated to the University of Southern California. This two-hour double-CD/triple-LP, their first product since 2001, is grand, somber, amelodic, arhythmic and slow, leaving plenty of time to admire the notes' altered states. Nothing is dreamy, misty or languorous--minimalists though they are, they're committed to accruing aural mass.

The difference between an album you love and an album you hate is often one or two cuts. An inspired song that fulfills a fantasy you never knew you had can make you believe in a whole side, while a song that commits some deadly sin can drag innocents to perdition. In ""Music,"" for example, Cat tells us there wouldn't be any ""wars in the world/If everybody joined in the band."" This kind of lie is called a tautology; it's like saying there wouldn't be any hunger if everyone became an ice cream man.

The pall pop metal casts upon 1990's horrendous Hot 100 is a triumph of mass narrowcasting. By downplaying anything blatant in the music, marketers minimize tuneouts based on accidents of gender or subgeneration--potentially, any passive Caucasian under age 25 should be willing to consume (in descending order of marginal differentiation) Poison or Warrant or Jon Bon or Heart or Cheap Trick or David Goddamn Cassidy. So let the nadir stand in for all of them. Swallowing hooks from blooze to prog, masking their will to power in fake vulnerability and youthcult rote, Winger is Whitesnake with the sexism muted and the facelifts down the road.

So united are we that few Voice readers are even aware of the title song, which spent seven weeks atop the country chart hawking the Iraq war with the doubly misleading refrain, ""And you say you shouldn't worry about bin Laden/Have you forgotten?"" (To be perfectly clear, no sane American says don't worry about bin Laden, and no honest one claims he had anything to do with Iraq before we devastated it.) Also included are permission to a P.O.W. to cut Darryl off on the interstate, a white-collar grunt screwing a Mexican hooker, a blue-collar grunt running away with his cashier girlfriend, a lament that the Civil War was ever fought, and ""Those Less Fortunate Than I,"" a rare and convincing argument that he and his listeners bear some responsibility for the inner city. Nor does this last seem a p.c. smokescreen. More likely Worley's just a thoughtful guy who watches too much Fox News. Which doesn't make his smash an iota less evil.

The culprits are ex-Easybeats Harry Vanda and George ""No Relation"" Young, the power-pop production heroes whose first LP with this singer actually did offer much of the bright thrust claimed for the style--not to mention the triviality that goes along with it. It didn't sell, though, and here V&amp;Y prove their depth of aesthetic principle by mellowing and syncopating their boy into MOR AOR fodder, four leisurely tunes to the side.
