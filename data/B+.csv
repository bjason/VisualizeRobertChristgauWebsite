FALSE,B+,Shake You Down,Gregory Abbott,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4280,"
The title single is a deceptively slight slow burn, a come-on so unassuming you don't notice you're being seduced until after you've slipped into something more comfortable, and most of the album works the same subliminally hooky con--harmless until it whispers ""gotcha,"" it's a model of consumer calculation. The persona is green-eyed handsome man with the wherewithal to support his fine tastes and yours. The songs are tuneful ditties with Bacharach/Bell chords and harmonies. And the singing is generic Spinners--growling or crooning or letting his falsetto do the talking, Abbott has learned to make the most of the edgy strain that's his unavoidable vocal trademark. There's something all too '80s about his bid to create a great love man without a great voice--if in 1971 Bill Withers was a toilet installer expressing his higher self and in 1978 Ray Parker Jr. was a bizwise craftsman selling his irrepressible formal exuberance, then in 1987 Abbott is a brokerage grunt looking to maximize his profitability. But by reinventing a black pop of modest means, he takes a first step toward returning that great crossover in the sky to the people. Wouldn't it be nice if somebody else took another one?

Popsymp enough to consider this an improvement over the far from awful The Book of Human Language (featuring ""The Balance,"" ""The Hurt,"" ""The Vision,"" etc.), I'm also streetsymp enough to hear how smug some might find the sensible moralizing and carousel hooks of ""Master Your High""--and people person enough to think ""Five Feet,"" named for the distance he wants to keep between him and you, is priggish. Still, most of these 16 tracks are sensible, moral, and hooky. And many are fun as well. Ten years a cult hero and his passion for rhyme is unabated. It would be priggish to deny him.

Hayseeds manqu������������������ who think he's betrayed his alt-country heritage should adapt to a world where traditionalism means not having a call out to the Neptunes. Tiny banjo fills, grand guitar solos, solo-acoustic, swelling strings that disguise your inability to distinguish between nuclear holocaust and breaking up with your girlfriend--they're all roots-rock now. With that tumescent ache in his voice, tunes easy as pickup lines, and a telltale tendency to vague out completely when saying anything you don't already know, Adams is a romantic egoist of the old school. Like every other alt-country hero worth spit, he assumed the pose because it gave him a way to look conceptual while knocking off some strophes. It's an excuse he's long past "

Can't claim this sustains the promise he had going for him on both sides of the Atlantic in the early '80s--that sense of limitless possibility betrayed by chaos in Nigeria, parochialism in Gaia, and the failure of Aura to move up the charts. But it's possible to applaud his development of Lagos's recording facilities and still be glad he's cut another studio album outside of Africa. A nickel short on both hook and flow, it nevertheless achieves an internationally suitable balance of detonation and quietude--and of voice, percussion, and guitar.

These boys are learning a trade in record time--even the sludgy numbers get crazy. Too bad the two real whompers are attached to rockstar lyrics, albeit clever ones, because Steve Tyler has a gift for the dirty line as well as the dirty look--anybody who can hook a song called ""Adam's Apple"" around the phrase ""love at first bite"" deserves to rehabilitate a blue blues like ""Big Ten Inch Record.""

Still, with almost a decade of bad records collective and solo behind them, there was no reason to expect a thing from this touching reunion. And against all odds the old farts light one up: if you can stand the crunch, you'll find more get-up-and-go on the first side than on any dozen random neogarage EP's.

Six of eight tracks on Corporate Revenge II were cut New Year's Eve 1984, a money gig for sure, and every one was at least eight years old at the time; a seventh previewed a song soon to appear on their Geffen debut--but recorded, heh heh, while they were still under CBS jurisdiction. And what we get is some of the toughest and least indulgent live metal ever vinylized, not quite Greatest Hits (four dupes) but way beyond Live Bootleg or Corporate Revenge I.

If fried brains is your idea of a rock dream, the first side will do the job at least as good as whatever raging slab is also your idea of a rock dream. For five songs, everything loud and acrid about them just keeps on coming--not even tune doctors can stave off the juggernaut. Of course, this band's idea of a rock dream is also the traditional ""Young Lust"" and ""Love in an Elevator""--OK as far as it goes, but I could do with more ""Janie's Got a Gun,"" in which an abused teenager offs her dad.

Lassana Diabat������������������'s balafon makes as much difference as Djelimady Tounkara's guitar, and though neither vocalist is prime, ngoni master Bassekou Kouyate packs more energy and gravity than second-stringer Eliades Ochoa even if his own solo album underwhelmed.

FALSE,B+,Ere Mela Mela,Mahmoud Ahmed,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4305,"
Because taste leads to knowledge, I enjoy fair familiarity with the West African music that's second cousin to rock and roll and none with the distant relatives in North Africa and the Middle East. But where knowledge ends, taste rules. Ahmed is a singer of unmistakable authority, and maybe an album of the ""many standards"" he's contributed to ""modern Ethiopian music"" would expand my horizons. Or maybe this is that album--I don't know. I do know that soon I lose the charge I get from the lead cuts, generated less by the ""strange, almost Indonesian-sounding scales"" of the vocals than by the two-sax horn section, which (maybe because it utilizes those scales) could be Afro-Brilliant Corners or ill-tempered synthesizer or avant-garde blues. For tastes that run to the Master Musicians of Jajouka and Om Kalsoum, he may be Elvis.

These muscular early recordings from 1972 or so, a/k/a ������������������thiopiques 6, sound rougher but no less fevered and distinct than the circa-1975 stuff collected on his certified classic Ere Mela Mela.

The title cut is the raunchiest fuck-me song in years, and the funniest: when Charlie bellows, ""I don't want you to fix my bed,"" the Misdemeanors chirp back, ""I'm not."" It just doesn't quit, and nothing else here comes up to it. But the overall level of rancor, humor, and genre experiment is gratifyingly high for what is basically an English r&amp;b album. Bang on.

FALSE,B+,Iraqi Music in a Time of War,Rahim AlHaj,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12154,"
Last February, mild-mannered Iraqi matinee idol Kazem al-Sahir played a sparsely populated Beacon. His 17-piece orchestra was exotically anodyne to me, painfully nostalgic to the attendant Iraqis. But either way it was steeped in denial. Recorded April 5 at Manhattan's Sufi Books, with Baghdad under attack, this solo oud recital is the opposite. The conservatory-trained AlHaj is a Saddam torture victim who escaped in 1991. Yet he is appalled by the destruction of his homeland. And yet again he betrays no rage: however uninspired as ""concepts,"" the ""compassion, love, and peace"" he preaches are courageous as music. With little knowledge of oud or taste for classical guitar, I'm struck by how unexotic he seems--how his sound, melodicism, and note values bridge East and West while remaining Iraqi. I'm impressed by how modest virtuosity can be in a classical tradition that honors simplicity. And I'm drawn in by the historical context, which implicates me in that tradition.

FALSE,B+,The Way of the World,Mose Allison,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14961,"
At 82, Allison has written a great song, which may seem odd given that it deals with neuron degeneration, and found an ideal producer, which is not how I usually describe Joe Henry. Ben Sidran offered him a sympathetic ear at Blue Note too, especially on 1997's Gimcracks and Gewgaws. But Sidran is a jazz loyalist with a songwriting sideline who brought out the player in him. Henry is a singer-songwriter with a jazz jones who conceived settings that would serve the lyrical gift that made Allison famous. ""My Brain"" is as right for Peter Townshend in 2010 as ""Young Man Blues"" was for Roger Daltrey in 1969. ""Modest Proposal"" and ""The Way of the World"" bring cosmic wisdom down to earth. ""I'm Alright"" is a big thumbs-up for anyone who flosses.

If Duane qualified as auteur, whatever that means, then he was the auteur-as-sideman. Over four sides (nineteen cuts, fifteen available elsewhere) he takes one vocal, contributes one original composition, and reserves his most definitive playing for other people's sessions--listen again to Boz Scaggs's ""Loan Me a Dime,"" not to mention the overlays Clapton got out of him on ""Layla."" Since Duane's only concept was the open-ended jam that so many session players mistake for artistic fulfillment, this is just as well; any format that limits the Brothers to four-minute tracks has much to recommend it. It doesn't result in very coherent albums, though. For scholars and acolytes.

Anybody who can comp for Aretha Franklin and ghost as the fifth Domino is obviously on his way to titanhood. One guitarist never made an album, though, and this is a lot more than brother Duane's showcase. Backup guitarist Dickey Betts puts in two songs of inspiration--""Revival"" shoulda been a hit--and Berry Oakley's bright ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" is a relief from the one-dimensional moan of the real leader of this band: little brother Gregg, whose ""Midnight Rider"" puts me in a forgiving mood anyway.

Finally a decent record comes out of Rolling Thunder, from what sounds like a country-rock band shocked by city living into a credible, slightly surrealistic nastiness, rather than the usual sleazy lies. T-Bone Burnett is that rare combination, a tall, inspired crazy; David Mansfield is a precocious, multi-instrumental sound effects man, and Steve Soles is a speed-rapping narcissist who can be thrown to the Poco fans. Plus a rhythm section that plays actual rock and roll. And Bobby Neuwirth in the background, where he belongs.

This unholy trio's second album is ""humbly offered in the light of the triune God,"" but T-Bone Burnett still sounds like a helluva monad to me. He doesn't know as much as he thinks he does, but when he steps aside from the songwriting the group usually falls flat--and when he pitches in, these guys could almost pass for a country-rock Steely Dan without money.

Nonbelievers consider him shrill, but I find something sweet and reflective right beneath his cool, caustic self-righteousness.

It's not easy to sound like no one else while performing what are still recognizably pop songs, and harder to remain anything like listenable in the process. But topped off by Joe Newman's ductile whine (can't call it weedy, too organic) and propelled by living bass and drums you'd swear were synthesized too, this Leeds-to-Cambridge foursome's unhurried electro-mesh is always more than pleasant and half the time mildly enthralling. ""Tessellate"" is the hit, ""Matilda"" the rouser, ""Dissolve Me"" the statement of aesthetic-erotic principle. How Brits can call them the new Radiohead beats me. But then, Brits and Radiohead often do.

So no wonder her excited new fanbase is so relieved by ""Archie, Marry Me."" Assuming the challenged couple get to cut that cake, I wish them many lubricious years of one-on-one ""debauchery""--Rankin's word, and I sincerely hope it's no metaphor.

Diligence rewarded: 10 years on the road, six DIY full-lengths, and 30-plus band members later, Reidsville, North Carolina's BJ Barham cold-turkeys the Jameson, ties the knot with Rachael, welcomes baby Josephine, and gets label financing on an album fit to introduce him to the nation at large. Beginning with the stricken anthem ""The World Is on Fire,"" he fashions songs for non-urbanites appalled by America's twin epidemics of cruelty and cowardice--for lifelong patriots negotiating the ground ""between hypocrite and hallelujah"" in what's become ""the home of the afraid.""

Anderson is Ricky Skaggs without Jesus--his voice lowdown rather than angelic, his roots in the honky tonks rather than the mountains, his album wild and blue, a sexier way to say (and sing) highways and heartaches.

By now, his irreverent working-stiff warmth is both likable shtick and a precondition of his specialty, happy love songs whose notion of permanent fun combines conjugal self-sufficiency and downhome raunch.

The difference isn't between ""spoken word"" and ""music."" The difference is that this is stories and the dull Bright Red is songs--and that right now she can better justify her obsession with the limits of American sense by telling about her travels than by devising metaphors for her displacement. Anyway, Bright Red's music retreats so far downtown from Strange Angels that it's reprised (minimally, of course) in the portentous swells and eerie punctuation employed so effectively on this album--which showcases her most striking musical talent, for recitative, even if the clipped phrases and drawn-out final consonants do get predictable.

Michael Bivins's juxtaposition of boy sopranos against dissonant jackbeats is pedagogy at its finest.

Problem is, while this 2010 album is arresting, it's also fatiguing. Of course she's singing in her sand-blasted power contralto, but over 12 tracks it's often more like she's holding forth--after all that hectoring you crave some lilt, the sense that maybe she'll dance a few steps when she does thisone live.

So in 2010 they handed production to a DFA honcho. At their best--namely, the echoing hypno-raves ""Magnetic Warrior"" and ""Wild Strawberries""--they now sound like the Seeds turning into Joy Division after somebody spiked their hash with MDA. Admittedly, they do occasionally get embarrassed and try to respect their roots--the garage kind, and even the roots kind. One way or the other, however, the singer's buried so deep you couldn't figure out what he was saying if you cared, which you don't. 'Course, sales did not ensue this time either.

They're lots bigger, so be grateful they're only somewhat broader--and that for Alex Turner maturity means subtlety, not cynicism. The herberts, paparazzi and under assistant Japanese promo men of the first few songs are rendered more generic by their big loud beats, but once Turner gets down to interpersonals his romances gone sour are tender and nuanced--check out the failed fling of ""Only Ones Who Know,"" the conflicted reunion of ""505,"" the scorned compassion of ""Do Me a Favour."" And if we have to endure songs about the superstar round, ""This House Is a Circus"" is wiser than Bloc Party's.

OK, I'm convinced. Sometimes funny, always real, and never ever pretentious, she proves that a big, husky voice needn't turn you into a self-important fool.

The secret of Armatrading's songs is their plainness, but it's also their drawback. When she hits an image--""I read your letter yesterday/It fell between the covers/And my bare skin""--she lights up a real life. More often, though, she just says what she has to say with whatever unprepossessing idiom is at hand, and her melodies are even less inclined to witticism than her words. This style of candor, engaging in theory, escapes tedium in practice by way of Armatrading's bluntly dramatic singing. Rarely have less tuneful songs so impressed themselves on my mind.

The perennially unclassifiable London West Indian meets Instant Records' Richard Gottehrer for her punchiest and most attractive album--she even comes close to laughing a couple of times. The title tune is to narcissism as ""Brown Sugar"" is to racism--she doesn't prettify it, but she doesn't forswear its pleasures, either. Suggesting to this white male heterosexual that unclassifiable may be a polite way to say unreachable--and that unreachable may be why even songs as well-realized as these wouldn't take that extra pop leap if Gottehrer weren't motorvating them.

Funk vocals are so cartoon-defined you'd figure the bassist to end up with the real band after the split. But it must have been Arrington's parts of Slave's collective compositions that made them stick. Here he proposes nothing less than to modulate the nasalities, glottal constrictions, and Mel Blanc raunch of Ohio playing into an emotionally integrated--soulful, as the expression goes--singing style. Funnier lyrics would make the task easier. Likewise funnier bass parts.

With its tape loops, orchestral percussion, and artsong timbres, this is as far from rock as guitar-based music can be; it's also closer to Eno's hypnotic repetitions than Henry Co. has ever come. This time the lyrics aren't so much attempted myths as haiku-like apothegms set in some abstract historical space. They're not great poetry, but they're not bad poetry either, which combined with the music makes for pretty good poetry.

These kids deserve to turn into teen heroes everybody can be proud of. They respect the rock and roll verities, but in a dynamic rather than an arty or nostalgic way: their instrumental wallop is powerful enough to keep them in there with the heavies, but so deft that the lyricism of their songs is left untouched. A lot of bands around CBGB will spend their lives wishing they could have gotten it together like this.

For six highly listenable, casually unmatched tracks, every beat hooks without being obvious enough about it--in a telling segue, a track that rides a Clams Casino glitch precedes a track that rides a Clams Casino Santigold cameo. Skillfully but never dazzlingly, congenially but never charismatically, with entertainment value added by a screwed-and-chopped alter ego, Rocky raps over the music without saying a damn thing older, meaner, and sharper rappers haven't said before. Then, bang, three dynamite songs, starting with an attention grabber bearing the asterisks-in-original title and literal message ""F**kin' Problems,"" followed by a f**k-you banger from the Skrillex songbook and the terrific virtual-posse ""1 Train"": hello goodbye to Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson, and Big K.R.I.T.

Not only is this token of tribute to the great god Disco notably less intense than the nonpareil Is It Still Good to Ya, it's notably less memorable than Send It, which offers three songs that beat anything here.

Hooked by their most confident and attractive single since 1978's ""Is It Still Good to Ya"" (and maybe since whenever), this never rises nearly so high again, but the nontitle side especially is a return to the consistency of So So Satisfied and Stay Free. Which is to say that these world-class songwriters have made themselves another groove album. But not to suggest the pertinent contradiction: the groove is a flow, the flow hips and hops.

Nearly two hours of 1997-99 cassette-only rarely peak and never drag. A battle rapper already touching on the conscience-stricken sexual and relationship issues that would move shysters to slot him emo, Slug is so excited to discover how much rhyme he has in him that his creative optimism revs Ant's subtle tracks.

Rapper Slug and beatmaster Ant both change direction on this classy package (a bound book--download that, suckers). Ant's shift is less auspicious: no samples. But the ""Shoulda Known"" synth groan is his catchiest hook in years, and most of the music he coaxes out of his Twin Cities g-s-d-etc. cohort is distinguished enough, especially given his partner's progress. Slug has always made more of self-examination than most cult celebs who work that shtick, and he shows them how on tracks like the well-named ""Me."" But he's even sharper empathizing with smaller-time losers. True, two of his angst victims are waitresses, the club-circuit version of the cab drivers who've been giving journalists man-on-the-street copy for generations--how about slaves of telemarketing, or data entry? Nevertheless, the lost lives and loves he sketches are so painfully familiar they feel like truth. And Ant's homey beats enhance the illusion.

For months I struggled to get with the commendable postpunk feminism and accessible quasifunk rock and roll of this gender-balanced quartet, and for months I failed. Only in person did I notice that gender symbol Lesley Woods had about as much to say now as Grace Slick did in 1967--more than you'd predict and less than you'd hope--and that on the whole they sounded like a bored Gang of Four. Dozed off during the climactic ""It's Obvious."" Which I found rousing anyway. Ditto for the album when I got home.

Given the putrefaction potential of the straightforwardly literary romanticism Roddy Frame affects, it's amazing he did so brilliantly with it even once. In fact, it's fairly amazing that second time out he gets away with it three songs' worth--three songs whose verbal lyricism sharpens the consistently winsome music, which is the kind of unlikely feat critics expect of straightforwardly literary types. Silly though it seems, Frame may be right to worry that his youth is passing at twenty-one, unless you want to blame the five merely winsome songs on producer Mark Knopfler, who probably thought ""Here lies the essence of my peers"" a deep line and certainly cheered ""Knife"" on to nine minutes.

So though this sounds like, gee, a Tricky record, it's more grooveful and also more playful, catering to the theoretical paying customers however private it must be. Even for us Tricky fans, these intimations of vitality are a relief. Note, however, that one of unk's three consecutive guest tracks provides the album's title and its peak.

In the end, though, I prefer their first, when the inspiration was fresh.

Mediocre hardcore you can ignore, especially if you live in an area where they dig up the street a lot; hardcore of a certain quality you love or hate. More than ex-fusioneer Dr. Know on ""gits,"" it's the distinctive if not exactly authoritative blackboard-screechy ""throat"" of H.R. that provides the quality here, and I like it, kind of.

Like a good rapper, Greg Graffin is once again singing his own tune--no matter how the three chords play themselves out on the (probably nonexistent, but never mind) lead sheet, the natural drone of his voice adds a music of its own. And he's still finding naive new truths in disillusioned hardcore truisms. ""Culture was the seed of proliferation but it has gotten melded into an inharmonic whole"" is bad writing; so's ""Prescience was not lacking and the present was not all."" Yet propelled by the drone and the three chords, they clobber you with the life-probe that's always been rock and roll's secret, excuse, or reason for being.

Pretty convoluted: great falsetto of great drummer-led black pop band seeks solo identity, turns for production aid (and duet on single) to drummer who's led great (i.e., best-selling) white art-rock band back into money by ripping off (appropriating?) black rhythms and vocals. Funny thing is: though Phil Collins plays a little louder than Maurice White, he's got almost as many chops and may even sing better.

In a time when the only black people with the guts to go for the soul are Mississippi recidivists and moldy oldies, this L.A. sophisticate has the audacity to pretend she can make pop music out of the shit.

He's an Austin-based singer-songwriter who'll be coming back for the rest of his life from near-death in a 1986 Shining Path bombing. Deafer than not, he also relearned guitar with his left hand, so it would be presumptuous in the extreme to dismiss his quiet, putatively unfinished music as any kind of affectation--John Prine imitator, some might say. Around the middle, the mercy here risks bathos because the sad mood is so unvarying, but soon it rights itself. My two favorites honor marriages, one ended in its natural time by death, the other saved before it's too late by near-death. I also recommend the quiet antiwar tract where the husband gets a kiss for bringing his wife a Coke at the Little League game. And the one about Peru.

London postfeminists who appropriate girl-group epiphenomena affectlessly, to signify inauthenticity, they fare better with odious Stock Aitken Waterman synthpop than with the shallow Swain &amp; Jolley synthsoul they started out with--where Leee Johns sounded dreamy wafting through that detached mix, these lucky lasses just seemed untouchably dreamlike. It's some kind of camp achievement that like the totally plastic singles group they play at being, they're equal to their most ""meaningful"" early material nevertheless, and some kind of camp limitation that their rilly greatest hits are ""Venus"" and ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.""

I've gone both ways with this group--if Music from Big Pink didn't tempt me away from my urban fastness, The Band did manage to make me jump around in my apartment. What gets in the way of this follow-up, however, is neither natural alienation nor critical overanticipation--it's the music itself, which simply overmatches the words. The tunes are so bright and doughty, and the musicians pitch in with so much will, that the domestic banalities of side one seem out of place in a way those of Delaney &amp; Bonnie, say, never do. And if the settings are too complex for what Robbie Robertson knows, they're too unfocused for what he doesn't know, as the confused politico-philosophical grapplings on side two make agonizingly clear. Memorable as most of these songs are, they never hook in--never give up the musical-verbal phrase that might encapsulate their every-which-way power. Which perhaps means that they don't have much to say.

I've always been put off by the sprung quality of the Band's music--the sense that if someone were to undo the catch its works would be propelled forth in all directions. Instead of energizing the impulse to piece together the lyrics--in the manner of the Stones, not to mention Bob Dylan--the sound of albums like Music From Big Pink and Stage Fright (though not The Band or The Basement Tapes) tends to reinforce their own metaphorical impenetrability. So the pure comeliness of every melody on this album led to an immediate infatuation. As I listened to the words, however, infatuation turned to mild affection, for the best of these songs is sentimental, and the worst (the two that are set in the city) are grossly sentimental. Only Garth Hudson, who has turned into a synthesizer natural, saves things in the end, and just barely.

The movie improves when you can't see it--Robbie Robertson and friends don't play anywhere near as smug as they look (or talk). And for an olio featuring eleven guest vocalists and a studio ""suite,"" the soundtrack is remarkably coherent. The four new Band tunes are nothing special, but everybody lays into the oldies. The blues sequence--beefed up by Toussaint's horns, Butterfield's harp, Muddy's pipes, and a blistering if messy Robertson-Clapton duet--is a small landmark, Morrison and Young are worth going back to, and Dylan's ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down"" is spunky enough to make up for ""Forever Young."" Not only that, Joni Mitchell and Neil Diamond are on the same side. Bet this ages a lot better than Woodstock--in a way, it already has.

Only a grinch would deny the intrinsic entertainment value of this significant-by-definition package. For one thing, these are the first known radio tapes where the talk is more precious than the music--in addition to everything else, they were the funniest rock stars ever. A few of the covers--""A Shot of Rhythm and Blues,"" ""Soldier of Love,"" ""Lucille,"" and a ""Baby It's You"" that proves once and for all that John was the cute one--are among their greatest. But a number of the more obscure songs (Ann-Margret? the Jodimars?) never reached vinyl for the simple reason that they were too lame, and I bet most of the seven Chuck Berrys were vetoed for redundancy. What's more, these drop-in sessions give off none of the adrenaline rush of the screaming meemies at the Hollywood Bowl or the amphetamine intensity that breaks out of the dim Hamburg tapes--the audience is missing, and no one else is powerful enough to take its place. So in the end the chief historical beneficiary is George Martin, who may just have driven his lads to heights they were too relaxed to scale on their own.

Just a few years ago Paul Heaton impressed with his empathy for his elders. Two albums later the song that turns on gray hairs seems to be about him. He's not close to losing his gift and may never be; pros like him have a right to their ups and downs, and after the soggy Quench, his music man Paul Rotheray has aired it out some. I dare the callowest Blur fan to resist the three-note piano-then-guitar-then-bass rhythm figure that anchors ""10,000 Feet,"" sure to be a single with B sides before this 19-cut there, 17-cut here release finishes its U.K. run. But Blur are younger than the Beautiful South, always will be, and now they're on Anglophilia's slippery slope themselves. Americans are so insensitive.

On the recordings of Paul Berliner and elsewhere I've always found the African thumb piano--mbira, kalimba, sanza--overly delicate, fragile as a music box. These experimental compositions, by a Camerounian musicologist who calls on a wide range of supplementary African instruments and techniques, are lithe and lovely. And when Bebey breaks into his subguttural chest voice you won't know whether to gasp or giggle.

The absurdist neofolkie as goofball abuser, most strikingly in (""ironic""?) rural guise--hick hermit, acoustic bluesman, wallower in honky-tonk lamentation. Satan, tacos, and aphids make multiple appearances, as does a crazy alien's unnatural falsetto. Cultish, and less than the sum of its inconsistent parts. But the offhand dazzle of these odds and sods is the stuff cults are made of.

Because he's also the poster child of '90s irony, which morphed so neatly into the passivity '00s alt-rockers pit against evil, the poster child of information overload doesn't quite get down to cases here. But unlike Guero this one really has some war in it--makes ""a kick drum sound like an SOS"" and turns a homeless woman into a soldier in Iraq. The best song addresses a chronic problem clearly for once: ""I think I'm in love and it makes me kind of nervous to say so."" ""Dark Star"" despairs so resolutely it could make a dead man grateful.

At first I was put off by the commercial desperation that induced these chronic fatuosos to turn out their brightest album in many years. But commercial success validated it: ""Nights on Broadway"" and ""Jive Talkin'"" turned out to be the kind of fluff that sticks. Sad to say, an unpleasant tension between feigned soulfulness and transparent insincerity still mars most of side two, which does, however, lead off with an undiscovered gem: ""All This Making Love,"" a baroque, frantically mechanical evocation of compulsive sex.

Play Boban Markovic or Kocani Orkestar and you hear contained chaos and wild drums. Play Beirut, most of it multitracked by young Zach Condon working alone, and you hear irrepressible melodicism tempered by harmonic melancholy. Rather than a watering down, this mildness is a d������������������tournement, the personal stamp of a romantic caught twixt Keats and Ossian--half prodigy, half bullshit artist. He might even bring off the Buckley-Wainwright-Yorke vocalisms if he minded his words instead of melismating croons and moans. But only""What can you do when curtain falls/What will you do when curtain falls/You're left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right"" (the Balkans, fucked coming and going) and ""The times we had/Oh, when the wind would blow and rain would snow/Were not all bad/We put our feet just where they had to go"" (the sorrows of young Zachary).

Whatever its pretensions, all country music offers the same primary reward: tuneful variations on the verities of the ordinary. These harmonizing eclectics sometimes outdo themselves. The rueful, nostalgic ""Old Hippie"" is Nashville's own ""Born in the U.S.A.""--""He ain't tryin' to change nobody/He's just tryin' to adjust""--and ""Lie to You for Your Love"" is a generic paradox that puts their strong weakness for ass-man smarm in perspective.

Graham Brown to whoo-ee Waylon Jennings, these harmonizing eclectics were as good as I could find. Which ain't great and never has been, but will do. No matter its pretensions, all country music has the same primary reward: tuneful variations on the verities of the ordinary. The second side, which proceeds from a Marshall Crenshaw cover to the generic paradox of ""I Would Lie for Your Love"" to the rueful ""Old Hippie"" to filler, is exemplary.

Because the new jack thing is supposed to be a ""pop"" move, softening rap's male-bonded ""rock"" ethos with sweet beats and romantic lies, their misogyny is more alarming than usual. Scared shitless of how much they need the one thing on their minds, they dis the girls who give it to them. ""I had to prove my manhood/Show her that the B-I-V was damn good,"" but he's sure it isn't just him who makes her hot: ""She's like that every day."" You might say they'd have a shot at a decent sex life if they'd stop obsessing on every ""sexy X-rated video queen."" But that's the symptom, not the cure--a cure the slick, juicy polyrhythms of Dr. Freeze and the Shocklee-Sadler crew make me wish they'd find. Sure it's possible they're just shaking off their New Edition image. It's also possible they're mean bastards.

I'm agnostic at best as regards the urban legend of Bennett's ageless cool. It's too classy on his end and too voguish on that of his eager young admirers. But this guy isn't just 80--he's 88, old enough to awaken in a 72-year-old like myself something approaching the dreams of immortality he instills his thirtysomething partisans. Granted, it's his twentysomething partner who provides the elan vital here. Gaga grabs these standards as Linda Ronstadt never did and Annie Lennox should be tried for trying--rock-'em sock-'em uptempo, not quite overripe on ballads, and having a ball both ways. In a true collaboration--both solo turns fall flat--it's her enthusiasm, her vulgarity, and the liberties she takes with the tunes that make the concept sing. That said, however, Bennett always sounds like he has some left in the tank. It's inspirational, I admit.

In a lot of ways this is a perfect record--easy studio funk unmarred by a single error of commission. Benno does Boz Scaggs a lot looser and happier than Boz Scaggs has for a while, and Bobby Keys stands out among the sidemen (Radle, Keltner, Utley) only because he's never sounded better. It's divided into a irresistible dance side and a decent enough listening side. Yet I no longer trust such basically unthinking supercompetence to provide lasting pleasure. Anyone who doesn't share my reservations should probably buy this, and even if you do--well, I keep playing it.

Roughing his velvet voice with just the slightest hint of alluvial mud as Clyde Otis's strings swooped and punched, Benton was rock and roll's answer to Nat King Cole or black music's answer to Pat Boone. Either way he filled a need, and he wrote most of his own tunes, too. Though this selection from his 22 r&amp;b hits (among them two unincluded number one Dinah Washington duets) is skimpier than there's any reason for, I'll take him over Lou Rawls anyday.

If Laurie Anderson's a musician, so's this conceptualist. Her band includes Ivan Julian and Adele Bertei, and she needs 'em: she credits composers on 11 of 12 cuts, including the boite medley (thank God for cabaret, it lets you stay in New York and enjoy your co-op), the Prince cover (for Sheila E., Apollonia, Vanity, Wendy, and Lisa), and ""The Women of Rock 'n' Roll"" (the story of her magic night with Stevie Nicks, who hasn't called in six months).

Well I'll be. The inventor of rock and roll hasn't made an album this listenable in fifteen years--no great new songs, but he's never written better throwaways (or covered ""Ozymandias,"" either). Both Berry and Johnny Johnson--the piano half of his sound for a quarter of a century--have tricked up their styles without vitiating or cheapening them, and the result is a groove for all decades. Minor for sure, but what a surprise.

This wasn't the great Chuck Berry concert if only because his voice is half shot--all those cracks don't ruin the fun, but they don't expose unexpected nuances in it either. Though Julian Lennon and Linda Ronstadt are less obtrusive when you can't see them trying to look like they belong, most of the cameos are still only adequate-to-embarrassing: the sole triumph is Eric Clapton's ""Wee Wee Hours,"" with a typically miraculous solo from the omnipresent Johnnie Johnson. And so what? It's still the best live album the man ever made. I mean, what do you want?

Like most Gypsy outfits, these Hungarians work weddings, which involves pleasing many ethnic subgroupings--subber than the ""Albanian, Greek, Serbian, Macedonian, and Turkish"" cited in the notes--and complement many moods. Some of these moods are kind of moody, and the players like to show off their chops and their respect for propriety.

The chirpy opener about fun in the sun is a feint--the lyrics that follow are so depressive that the consistent cheer and conservatism of the tunes is like some perverse minimalist art move. Problem is, nothing in Beth Cosentino's self-inflicted boy problems and palpable longing for a childhood when she didn't have to deal with them suggests that she's got the guts for such a concept. Melodically and verbally, her clarity is a gift. But until she bucks up and tells that jerk to take a hike, it's not going to do her much good. Nobody loves a doormat.

I keep waiting for number two to come through on the dance floor the way the debut did, but ""Party out of Bounds"" and ""Quiche Lorraine"" are expert entertainments at best and the wacko parochialism of ""Private Idaho"" is a positive annoyance.

Sorry, but my fond belief in Kate &amp; Cindy as postmodern girl duo has just gone the way of my fond hopes for Joan and Chrissie as rock and roll future. Except for the postfeminist ""Housework,"" they contribute watercolors posing as Kenny Scharfs--not only don't ""Summer of Love"" and ""She Brakes for Rainbows"" redeem anybody's '60s retro, they don't even take off on it. So Fred's abrasive camp saves the day, and talk about satiric justice--he gets off a credible nudist anthem, a credible psychedelic fantasy, and (get this) a credible ecology song in the process.

In the end, their made-in-U.K. breakthrough attempt is a catchy, unconventional pop record--not only is the song for war-dead children about kids they knew, but you can be sure it doesn't suggest the war was unnecessary. But that's all it is. Ingratiation is so ingrained in these former freedom fighters that they're almost swallowed by former Sade producer Robin Millar, who goes for pan-Africana with quasi-Zairean horns and transforms subtle cross-rhythms into upfront hooks. Rewriting ""Skokiaan"" as ""Happy Birthday"" because they know ""Happy happy Africa"" won't wash anymore, structuring ""Rugare"" (""work hard and reap the fruits of your labour"") around schlocko synth chords and bridges that go nowhere, they're victims of crossover, compromising and accommodating when they should be expanding and appropriating. And they're still not half-bad.

Though they don't want you to know it, these hateful little twerps are sensitive souls--they're moved to make this godawful racket by the godawful pain of the world, which they learn about reading everything from textbooks to bondage mags.

Postpunks should forget Janis Joplin and dig this: just because they practiced in their own $300-a-month Marin commune doesn't mean they weren't a garage band.

""I ain't rap about dope nor do I sell it,"" raps a Mississippi ""country boy"" who's more mixed about pimping--maybe unreadable, maybe of two minds, maybe blurring the pimp sound and the pimp hustle. The sound he's definitely got down: a rich, comfortable funk he transports south from Willie Hutch's The Mack. And as befits someone who believes N.I.G.G.E.R. stands for ""Naive Individual Glorifying Greed and Encouraging Racism"" and gets life satisfaction from rotating his tires, his sound equals his hustle. Some may think his rhymes are too simple. I find ""Some thangs are forever, nothin' ever last/Like the risin' of the sun or when Big Mama pass"" pretty deep myself.

And without benefit of a ""Crack Attack"" or ""Shoot the President,"" here's 10 inches of ugly introduction to their politically incorrect punk-industrial. The guy processes his voice down deep and then talk-sings like a demented trucker, drag racer, or metal animal, leaving a sexy Kim Gordon tribute/parody to the gal, who also shines in groupie and waitress cameos.

Disrupting her delicate, speechlike soprano with unpredictable guitar comps acoustic and electric, Adrianne Lanker and her guys mean to prove that women needn't be loud to be strong and men needn't be needy. As the explicitly heterosexual opener puts it: ""There's a woman inside of me / There's one inside of you, too."" Admittedly if not proudly best suited to headphones or computer speakers, the band is subtle, arty, obscure--you know ""Great White Shark"" references an automobile accident only because Lanker said so in an interview, and ""Watering"" attenuates the brutality of sexual assault with imagery so sensationalistic it's abstract.

Seeing Youth live gave me new insight into why they call it toasting--he's a toastmaster, a Rastafarian George Jessel, complete with carry-a-tune crooning, name-dropping tributes, and shuffle-off-to-Babylon stage routines. All of which were wonderful--the enthusiasm was that unmediated. His evolution into a roots Mr. Entertainment has changed his records, which now include songs. Not great songs, either, as I would say. But ""Get On Up"" is a great chant, ""Bang Dibo"" a great goof, ""Many Moods of Big Youth"" a great m���""We Can Work It Out"" a great cover (by anybody).

But since Lester was a genius, I have to mention that it's manifestly more confident than 1981's perfectly acceptable Jook Savages on the Brazos, with which it shares four songs, preserved for posterity a second time after the singer had the opportunity to develop some mannerisms. He was better off relying on force of personality--musically he always had the instincts, and words were no problem.

After singing (and playing) the blues for ten years, Elvin makes like he was born to boogie. Completing his Marin-to-Macon switch by recording at Criteria in Miami instead of the Record Plant in Sausalito, he here provides Capricorn with enough hooks to keep the Brothers gone fishin for the next decade. All very debrained, of course, but the first side never stops, and if the title cut isn't the label's first top-ten song since ""Ramblin' Man,"" either my name ain't Juke Box Johnny or ""Fooled Around and Fell in Love"" got there first.

Bishop is a road musician. He doesn't knock himself out making Great Albums, but he doesn't get all twisted up racing after Breakthrough Hits, either. He doesn't even Promote Product much--on tour, he mentioned this LP only when he did a song from it, which happened once.

After six more years of Thatcher and the dawning of electrohop, it's as if Linx had laminated the soft edges of its prophetic premeditated funk to a flash, beatwise sheen. Both vocals and politics are more strident, pausing for love only to flog the jezebel whose lust for diamonds ends in the murder of an innocent jeweler by an innocent (sez they) black Briton.

This hasn't made itself felt the way Red did for fairly marginal reasons, hype/timing not least among them--the need for a new Marley becomes less urgent as the self-evident truth that there ain't gonna be one is absorbed.

The (translated) lyrics are intelligently romantic (with an Indian smuggler smuggled in), and after the usual unusual effort, I can report that the tunes are solid, the grooves Latino, and the vocals proof of a major pop intelligence--he's revamped the floridity of an entire tradition in the image of his own physical limitations. Can you dance to it? Better than me, I'm sure.

On their second try, producer Steve Barri and arranger Michael Omartian pull out the pop stops, and while the result isn't too long on conviction it does have its own ersatz character. Refabricated intros worthy of Three Dog Night, prefabricated songs worthy of Bobby Bland, and a woman named Yolanda who leaves Bobby ""in this wilderness with no money down""--the wilderness being Charlestown, South Carolina, and Yolanda's Pygmalion being the same guy who wrote ""My Maria"" and ""Shambala.""

Despite the funky title, this is Bland's country album, and while it won't turn him into Ray Charles, it's a modest success--he gets more suitable (even funky) arrangements form Nashvillians Don Gant and Ron Chancey than Charles gets from Sid Feller. On side one he sounds completely at (or down) home stealing songs from Merle Haggard and Charlie Rich. Overdisc he seems a little ill at ease reassuring a virgin with bom-bom-boms, but wouldn't you?

One of two bands cited as proof that L.A. punks aren't just bigots with mohawks (the other, the Go-Go's, has--gulp!--girls in it), these rock and rollers don't quite fit their rockabilly revivalist pigeonhole. Where the average Whitecat is so pencil-necked he can hardly hold up an acoustic bass, they have muscles, and where the average Rockin' Ronnie Weiser signing is a barely literate has-been who never really was, they have brains and potential. Or so songs like ""Barn Burning"" and, believe it or not, ""American Music"" lead one to believe. They do get that chickenshit Scotty Moore guitar sound right, though. With Ronnie at the boards, they don't have much choice.

FALSE,B+,Dinner Music,Carla Bley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=544,"
I'm quite taken with this, which reminds me in an abstract way of Another Green World. Where dance jazz was unselfconsciously functional, this is art jazz that was designed to be functional--just as Eno designed his electronic pop-rock to fade into the background the way so much electronic pop-rock does anyway. The result is yet another of those Jazz Composer's Orchestra get-togethers between avant-gardists (JCOA stalwarts Michael Mantler and Roswell Rudd) and pop luminaries (the Stuff studio funk axis), and this time the music meshes. Unfortunately, however, I find that only two of the right cuts--""Ida Lupino"" and ""Ad Infinitum""--combine melody and rigor as magically as the double-edged concept promises.

Ahh, New York. I remember Debbie Blondie when she was singing with nursery-rhyme breathiness for a group called the Wind in the Willows. Now she sounds flatly cynical against a very funny aural montage of girl-group and original-punk usages from the prepsychedelic era--less blithe, certainly, but more, you know, together. Which is what new-punk posturing is all about. Special award: best use of trash organ since ""Light My Fire.""

Side one is everything this band is supposed to be--seven fresh, clever, evanescent songs, each with its own hip twist. Whether Deborah Harry is claiming that using telepathy to win at poker is ""really not cheating"" or executing a siren call for the electric age (the bell she imitates sounds like it belongs on a squad car), her vocals are on top and out front, a pop-rock delight. But side two bombs, except for ""Kidnapper"" and a couple of refrains, and the singing gets lost in the mud. Me, I'd buy it for side one. But I'm not sure about you.

Reggae from a multilingual Ivory Coast star who puts message up front, this probably wouldn't get over on words even if you understood Mandingue or Dioula--in French and English, the politics are naive and toothless. As usual in West African pop, the voice is too mild, and as usual in West African reggae, the rhythm section is too buoyant. But glancing off such dance tunes as ""Idjidja"" and ""Kiti"" and, yes, ""Come Back Jesus"" (not to mention the base-covering ""S�����""), the singing completes an eloquently transatlantic groove--Afropop dread, a fast-flowing stream whose depth can't be fathomed. This achievement is also very West African.

There's something suspect about this ex-Manhattanite turned parttime Parisian and his multilingual Islamic reggae from Abidjan--he's a third-world marketer's dream even if he's marketing himself. But at worst he puts out a finer grade of generic Wailers than Rita's ever going to front, and three cuts sound like acts of genius rather than strokes of luck: the otherwise Francophone ""Kalachnikov Love,"" whatever that means (and I want to know); ""Jerusalem,"" slipping with a sly presumption of innocence from basic English to pidgin Hebrew, pidgin Arabic, and pidgin French; and ""Travailler C'Est Trop Dur,"" which breaks his loping skank into a pretty gallop. After all, there's something suspect about Prince, too.

Four arresting pieces of intelligent funk-lite set up six merely accomplished pieces of intelligent funk-lite before Dev Hynes's virtuosity saves the day. The transvestite subway trip ""Uncle ACE"" turns focus track when its distressed harmonics bloom into a saxish finale-turned-fade, with David Longstreth's pained shtick right after augmenting the mood. But despite the added charge of two surprise raps whose ordinary male sexism and striving accentuate Hynes's doomed sweetness, too much vocal space is tendered the pretty, vacant Samantha Urbani. Only when the auteur's piano saturates the climactic ""Time Will Tell"" does his vision of romance in perpetual suspended animation regain the poignancy he's so convinced it's worth.

Ramones fans will claim his first-beat sledgehammer is monotonous; I enjoy its simplicity just like I do the Ramones'. Not as much, I admit--""All I Want in the World (Is to Find That Girl)"" would be a retarded change of pace even if Kurtis talked it, and he doesn't. But though it bodes ill for both his rhythms and his politics, the bare competence of his Bachman-Turner Overdrive cover has special charm, and his hit metapun is a true breakthrough.

The best Stylistics album since Round Two is a Philly Phormalist's delight. Produced by Gamble-Huff veteran Norman Harris, it features the velvety falsetto of Ted White and four hit singles (only one of which, the Tod Browning tribute ""Sideshow,"" has broken pop). What's more, the filler includes a seven-minute ""Just Don't Want to Be Lonely"" that helps me understand why Ronnie Dyson and the Main Ingredient both cut the song, though not why anybody bought it when they did.

Warning: critics' band, managed by Sandy Pearlman with occasional lyrics by R. Meltzer. Reassurance: the most musical hard rock album since Who's Next. (Well, that's less than six months, and this is not a great time for hard rock albums.) The style is technocratic psychedelic, a distanced, decisively post-Altamont reworking of the hallucinogenic guitar patterns of yore, with lots of heavy trappings. Not that they don't have a lyrical side. In ""Then Came the Last Days of May,"" for instance, four young men ride out to seek their fortune in the dope biz and one makes his by wasting the other three.

Says S. Pearlman: ""We want to be disgusting, not trans-repulsive."" Says R. Meltzer: ""This is really hard rock comedy."" Musically, Long Island's only underground band impales the entire heavy ethos on a finely-honed guitar neck, often at high speed, which is the punch line. And the lyrics aren't inaudible, just unbelievable--a parody-surreal refraction of the abysmal ""poetry"" of heavy, with its evil women and gods of hellfire. Which is not to suggest that it doesn't become what it takes off from. But is that bad or good?

Just when I figured they were doomed to repeat themselves until the breakup, they come up with the Fleetwood Mac of heavy metal, not as fast as Tyranny and Mutation but longer on momentum, with MOR tongue-in-cheek replacing the black-leather posturing and future games.

If John Fogerty really wants to play all the instruments, he's wise to perform country music, because overdubbing on top of yourself is a good way to get the kind of semimechanical feel Nashville producers strive for. Although the energy rushes here (one guitar break on ""Jambalaya,"" the no-no-nos on ""Heart of Stone"") are almost as rare as the new songs, the voice sounds more original than ever: Fogerty may not be Jimmie Rodgers, but he makes a damn fine Lefty Frizzell.

Indifferent to concepts like ""content"" and ""originality,"" this casual dance-hit rip cycles (and recycles) about three basic riffs and some raucous yowsah-yowsah into an album that divides into irresistibly inspired A side and delightfully tossed-off B as surely as any New Orleans novelty or rockabilly romp.

Although these casually lapidary popsongs sounded slight as singles, they gain authority laid down seven or eight to a side. But for all their jumpy originality they're still slight, and Richard Barrone's lyrics are so oblique you have to wonder what his angle is. Growing up isn't that confusing--or that personal.

Though one's moralistic quibbles do recede as history demonstrates how much worse things can get and how little music has to do with it, KRS-One's talk of fucking virgins and blowing brains out will never make him my B-boy of the first resort. I could do without the turf war, too--from the Lower East Side, not to mention Kingston or Kinshasa (or Podunk), Queens and the South Bronx are both def enough. But his mind is complex and exemplary--he's sharp and articulate, his idealism more than a gang-code and his confusion profound. And Scott LaRock was a genius. Sampling blues metal as well as James Brown, spinning grooves to toast by, blind-siding the beat with grunts and telephones and dim backtalk, he was spare and rich simultaneously. Music will miss him more than Jaco Pastorius and Will Shatter put together.

FALSE,B+,By All Means Necessary,Boogie Down Productions,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=414,"
Deprived of the great murdered beatmaster Scott LaRock, KRS-One is reduced to a stark minimalism that matches his mood: still brandishing his piece on the cover, he's as serious as Jesse inside, occasionally pretentious but never full of himself. He criticizes the self-proclaimed kings of a scene too democratic to support royalty and the self-proclaimed godfathers of a scene too young to have an old school, identifies tribalism as the white man's game, and comes out strong for peace through strength. Only ""Jimmy"" is much fun, and ""Jimmy"" is a condom commercial. But at his best--""Stop the Violence,"" which might conceivably catch black radio in a community-spirited moment of weakness--he's as complex and cold-eyed as the kings themselves, with two extras: he's not middle-class and he's on a mission.

KRS-One isn't just serious, he aspires to sainthood, and tough noogs if you think that makes him ""boring"" or ""pretentious"" or any of that racist, anti-intellectual cant--he comes so close that the whole of the record is greater than the minimalism of its blueprint stylee. Austerely sampled or all the way live, the music per se is almost hookless and swingless. But the dubwise skank of his natural groove carries his rhymes when the rhymes themselves don't capture the consciousness like a good hook should. Though I wish he didn't feel compelled to argue what color Moses was, his fundamental conceit--a peace harder than violence--is visionary. And when he takes no shit from the police, I say amen.

This is palpably more strident. The Longhair medley just isn't as sly and delicate as it should be, and in general there's too much reliance on the left hand, with the consequent loss of dynamic subtlety compounded by a klutzy drum mix. But except on his unintentional travesty of ""King of the Road,"" Booker's forthright way with songs like ""All Around the World"" and ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"" and even ""Hound Dog"" has a barroom feel missing from the live disc. And the glorious schmaltz of ""Swedish Rhapsody"" was intended by an artist with a passion for camp.

As the clash of punk guitars battled the swelling Springsteen-cum-Lizzy pseudoclimaxes, I began to suspect a fix, especially since record-bizzers have been heard to murmur fondly about the ""musical"" skill of these up-and-coming Irish nasties. But throughout a first side that often shifts mood but never quits, this is the real stuff, banging home the survival value of a brain unclogged by useless feelings. Unfortunately, side two bogs down in evocations of misogyny, boredom, and the plight of the young, all surrounding an apparent throwaway called ""Close as You'll Ever Be"" that ought to be a single.

Satisfied owners of the group's Mercury debut might spring for the import (on Ensign), since this repeats two of the better tunes from that new wave no-sale. And seekers after straight-ahead cacophony might look around for the Mercury. But though this does turn rather campy at times--Bob Geldof's cheerfully narsty opportunism has lost body and focus--it will certainly do. I'll take a good calculating song about Adolf Hitler over an ordinary calculating song about the perils of romance any day, and if you're heading your music toward the rock mainstream, wit and flash don't hurt.

Yes indeed, the man can sing, though given that he made his name as a musician and writer I'm equally gratified he can rap. Competently in both cases. The difference comes in what he sings or raps.

Though the Rubber Band was the only P-Funk spinoff to sell through, distinguishing it from the parent organization quickly became problematic. Conceived partly as bait for Warner Bros., it did serve the special interests of subteen Geepies for a while, not to mention the special interests of Bootsy, certainly the most charismatic Funkateer save the Dr. himself, but before long Parliament was making kiddie moves and the Starman was fizzling. So on the one hand this is a welcome return to form, and on the other it's interim P-Funk--from the ""Shortnin' Bread"" intro through the ""unenjoyment line"" protest through the jump blues tribute all the way to the climactic ""Sound Crack,"" which after several dead-end tangents returns all space travelers to the ineluctable One.

When I think about it, I like the joke, too. So how come I'm not fucking, dancing, or laughing? Well, I suspect it ahs more to do with not being eleven than with not being black, and more to do with my funnybone than my booty.

These righteous Haitians are thought of as a pan-African party machine, but in the aural fact they're devotional. Well past their new flavor moment, they turn out to be one of those bands that develops its craft rather than one of those bands that hits you over the head with an idea they proceed to wear out. Something like soulful, drenched with synthesizers because synthesizers seem natural, their impassioned trance recalls Nyabinghi chants more than Holiness hymns, and is closely related to both.

Though there could be more flesh on the voice and more sass in the lyrics, Johnny Watson (with shades of Mose Allison, and, well, Blood Ulmer) isn't such a bad vocal model for a guitar player who wants to better himself. Nice Memphis Slim cover, too.

In its own way, this is audacious stuff right down to the stubborn wispiness of its sound, and Bowie's actorly intonations add humor and shades of meaning to the words. Which are often witty and rarely precious, offering an unusually candid and detailed vantage on the rock star's world. Admittedly, for a long time I wondered who cared, besides lost kids for whom such access feels like privilege.

The pubeless is-he-naked? illustration inside the doublefold suggests not bisexuality but asexuality--the affliction of a romantic for whom love turns nasty, awkward, and exploitative when touched by lust. So maybe the bleak future Bowie likes to scare his fans with is a metaphor for his own present, the American phase of which is reflected by these hardrocking mechanisms. But the cover, ""Let's Spend the Night Together,"" opens other possibilities: its lyric suggests an alternative to the brutality of ""Cracked Actor"" and its music can help you through the bitterest realities. As a result, this is more interesting thematically than Ziggy Stardust, and it's also better rock and roll.

I find side one's seven ""fragments""--since the two that clock in at less than 2:45 are 1:42 and 2:20, the term must refer to structures rather than length--almost as powerful as the ""overlong"" tracks on Station to Station. ""Such a wonderful person/But you got problems"" is definitely a love lyric for our time. But most of the movie music on side two is so far from hypnotic that I figure Bowie, rather than Eno, must deserve credit for it. I mean, is Eno really completely fascinated by banality?

When I first heard the Enofied instrumental textures on side two, as background music, they struck me as more complex than their counterparts on Low, and they are. Low now seems quite pop, slick and to the point even when the point is background noise; in fact, after I completed my comparison, I began to play it a lot. But what was interesting background on ""Heroes"" proved merely noteworthy as foreground, admirably rather than attractively ragged. Maybe after the next album I'll get the drift of this one.

If James Brown is the only rock and roller who deserves more than one concert album, then the Bowie to ban is David Live. Stage kicks off with some well-chosen Bowie oldies before moving into refreshingly one-dimensional versions of his best songs since 1975, including the key Eno collaborations, which were often oversubtle to begin with. For fans only, of course. I'm one.

No concepts, no stylistic excursions, no avant collaborations--this songbook may be the most conventional album he's ever put his name on. Vocally it can be hard to take--if ""Teenage Wildlife"" parodies his chanteur mode on purpose the joke's not worth the pain, and if you think Tom Verlaine can't sing, check out ""Kingdom Come""--though anyone vaguely interested has already made peace with that. Lyrically it's too facile as usual, though the one about Major Tom's jones gets me every time. And musically, it apotheosizes his checkered past, bringing you up short with a tune you'd forgotten you remembered or a sonic that scrunches your shoulders or a beat that keeps you on your feet when your coccyx is moaning sit down.

A find. Transcending its well-connected professional genre, the slightly distracted passion of Bramblett's singing combines with his oblique fusion of Southern boogie, studio country-rock, and Caribbean polyrhythms to take the edge of privilege off his philosophical fatalism. His music is too warm and funny to sound self-satisfied, and the way he collects images around an aphoristic catchphrase is too open-ended to sound smug. Start with side two.

It owes more lyrically to Gil Scott-Heron than to Barry White but evokes both and is candid to the point of wryness (and terseness) about using words primarily for musical color. I like the way the synthesized violins are timed and love the fanfare coda to ""Love,"" my favorite cut.

FALSE,B+,"New York, Fall 1974",Anthony Braxton,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11270,"
Braxton's music is classified as jazz because Braxton is a black saxophonist who often plays with jazzmen, but that hardly covers it. The feeling is closer to eccentricity than it is to spontaneity, and just as I was starting to dig the cerebral exercises on side two--one cut features new-music synthesizer minimalist Richard Teitelbaum--I noticed that even the wildest of the new-jazz james on side one was sounding cerebral. Don't get me wrong--my cerebrum really got a buzz on. But this is often a little stiff.

FALSE,B+,Breakfast Special,Breakfast Special,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6457,"
Where it survives as indigenous country music, bluegrass may well be a wondrous thing, but among citybilly archivists it only magnifies the usual folkie escapisms--purism and pastoral nostalgia--by encouraging mindless virtuosity. Which makes this virtuosic but eclectically streetwise record a small miracle that should delight anyone more spiritually attuned to the genre than a faithless wretch like me.

FALSE,B+,The Very Long Fuse,Breaking Circus,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4457,"
A guitar band with drum machine, as Chicago as Big Black or industrial dance music. Or maybe Big Black is industrial dance music. Well, this isn't--it's hard-edged rock and roll, more like Australia's Celibate Rifles than Britannia's identically configured Three Johns. In standard postpunk mode, the appeal is sound not sense--the good lyrics come in snatches at best. But the sound would never have caught my ear without the completely realized ""(Knife in the) Marathon,"" a dark tale of Olympic racism, or terrorism, or simple skulduggery.

FALSE,B+,"Lifted, or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground",Bright Eyes,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11726,"
Spewing his sprawls of lyric, melody, and instrumentation, Conor Oberst is the poster boy of the American Agony Association. Respect him as a co-equal and he'll drive you out of the room in nothing flat. Feel or indulge his suffering youth, however, and he'll kindle something like awe. This great leap forward, 13 songs lasting 73 minutes without benefit of extended groove, comes to a climactic halt with ""Let's Not Shit Ourselves (To Love and Be Loved),"" where his apology for a suicide attempt elicits his dad's Inspirational Retort: ""Child, I love you regardless and there is nothing you could do that would ever change this. I'm not angry. It happens. You just can't do it again.""

Any Jewish boy with glasses who makes his living doing Blind Willie McTell imitations had better remember his place. Hence, this key line: ""When I got up this morning I had Someone Else's Blues.""

So much more consumable than Jacob or Hublot, the food Bronson fixates on never gets fancier than heirloom tomatoes or seared Ahi tuna--no cross-hatched merganser breast with lychee infusion and truffle garnis for this fat guy. With crucial propulsion and more crucial fun from no-name Tommy Mas's unfashionably sampled, unfashionably funky beats, his gluttony humanizes hip-hop materialism at an economically accessible level. If only he didn't treat women as meat like thousands of hip-hop hungries before him, I might even play it for my favorite cook at dinnertime. Instead, the follow-up Well-Done trades in his homie Tommy on the more renowned and predictable Statik Selektah as it seeks revenge for the bad romance the fat guy had coming.

As previously and probably hereafter, I always eat up the food stuff and occasionally retch at the sex stuff, with the ""Thug Love Story 2012""/""Hookers at the Point"" pairing the test case. Sexist though both are, I'm a fan because like Ghostface's ""Wildflower"" they come down on the right side of that razor-thin exposure-exploitation dividing line. But where with Eminem's ""Kim"" I'll argue that case ad nauseum, here no one is obliged to differentiate between those tracks and the one where he makes the ""joke""-I-hope-he-claims about sharing a hooker with his three-year-old son--sometimes dumb is just evil, end of story. What nobody should try and deny is this album's accelerating momentum and unstinting silliness--not only does he call the itty-bitty that needs ""the surgery"" his ""pee-pee,"" he rhymes it with ""TV,"" ""CD,"" ""3-D,"" and ""Fiji."" Yummiest food-sex confluence: cunnilingus as razorback clams with bucatini.

Brooks apparently lives in a milieu so saturated with comedy that laughter itself seems redundant, perhaps even vulgar. All that matters is the idea of Funny. In just that sense, the album is very Funny. Fortunately, it is also good for a modicum of laughs. Reminiscent in tone of Are You on Something? by Ray D'Ariano, who is now a successful promo man at MCA, where he keeps everyone in the office in stitches.

Burdened by the responsibilities he believes come with success, Brooks leads with the first song in Nashville history to inveigh, however discreetly, against not just racism but homophobia. There's nothing as wicked as ""Papa Loved Mama,"" which didn't bat an eye when mama fucked around or papa ran her over with his truck. But ""Somewhere Other Than the Night,"" about sex on the farm, and ""Learning to Live Again,"" about a divorc������������������'s blind date, typify the smarts of a guy who knows not all suburbanites are as stupid as Michael Bolton believes.

A little heavy-handed (all right, a little more heavy-handed), with three rodeo songs and a big fat Irish anthem that won't be to everyone's taste (all right, your taste). Don't matter, because he's so far from the schlock phony he's taken for--so open-hearted, so extreme, so sui generis--that all but a couple of tracks do his thing even when he's protesting too much (which, all right, may be his thing). Cute trick: the two about marriage explain his weakness for bucking broncos.

FALSE,B+,Don't Be Cruel,Bobby Brown,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=364,"
It's the eternal fast one/slow one problem--when he states his prerogatives and tries to make the world dance he's irresistible, when he masks his motives and tries to make the tenderoni moan he's an obvious con. But he earns his prerogatives: the internal rhymes and voice-electrobeat patterning of the title track are so tricky they're hooky. And since I've never been much of an expert on tenderoni, I'm willing to suspend judgment on the half that leaves me unmoved.
"
FALSE,B+,One More for the Road,Charles Brown,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4461,"
This long overdue piece of record-making hits you with its craft and taste. Of course, you think. Brown's powers are undimmed since he topped the charts as a lounge singer forty years ago, so why shouldn't he sound just as fine in the studio today? And he does. With Billy Butler on guitar, his combo is at least as choice as the Three Blazers, and he has forty years of lounge classics to draw on--""One for My Baby,"" ""I Miss You So,"" ""Who Will the Next Fool Be,"" all right. There's only one problem: Brown is no Nat King Cole. His voice slips into the lugubrious so reflexively that at times you suspect clutch problems with the master reel, and it could just be that he's best appreciated over a highball--or else, like so many chart-toppers before him, in three-minute doses.

FALSE,B+,Bustin' Loose,Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6462,"
Toward the end of 1978, these D.C. journeymen got lucky and hit the discos with the title track, which was very funk-soul for that disco moment. The album that resulted is almost like a field recording--a completely unpretentious document of what sort of originals a modestly gifted funk-soul dance band might be doing in 1978. There's even a salsa. Very likable.
"
FALSE,B+,Atrocity Exhibition,Danny Brown,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16989,"
Brown has reached the point where success deadens more than it animates, conspicuous consumption turns trope turns bore, and copping to your ""downward spiral"" loses its pedagogical mojo. He's still plenty clever, but saying ""Some people say I think too much/I don't think they think enough"" only begins to prove it, and blaming his biochemistry as he keeps bitches on rotation is getting ""old,"" as one might say. What saves it more than ever is musicality. Not only does Brown add the voice of a thoughtful struggler to his squealing weirdo and caustic thug, he sees to it that the tracks permute and evolve into something that feels thought through. So when he dubs himself ""Coltrane on Soul Plane,"" Coltrane he earns, sort of. But I read where Soul Plane--never saw it, never will--was an unfunny hip-hop/blaxploitation parody of the already dumbass laff riot Airplane. Right, even bad jokes are better than going on about what a mess your life is. But they don't straighten it up.
"
FALSE,B+,Revolution of the Mind,James Brown,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6466,"
Ever the innovator, Brown here presents a live double-LP, ""Recorded Live at the Apollo Vol. III."" Good stuff, too--a consistent overview of his polyrhythm phase. But ""Sex Machine"" is sharper and ""Bewildered"" deeper on last year's live double. And with the medley on side three the tempo gets so hot that anybody but JB will have trouble dancing to it.
"
FALSE,B+,The Payback,James Brown,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6472,"
Because more is often more with JB, a studio double comprising eight long songs isn't necessarily a gyp. Especially when all the songs have new titles. Not only does most of this work as dance music, but two slow ones are actually sung. ""Time Is Running Out Fast,"" however, is a spectacularly inaccurate title for a horn-and-voice excursion that shambles on for 12:37.

FALSE,B+,Jam/1980's,James Brown,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6481,"
Free of the pretentious bluster that has marred so much of his work in the disco era, this is the groove album Brown has been announcing for years. He's finally learned how to relax his rhythms without diluting his essence, and the A side is simply and superbly what the title promises, though he may have the decade wrong. The B side is less of the same, and I bet no one who buys this record ever chooses to play it. I also bet they'd get dancing if they did.
"
FALSE,B+,James Brown . . . Live: Hot on the One,James Brown,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4463,"
Hard to believe almost ten years have passed since JB had the wherewithal to release a live double--not the new tunes, which he mostly skips for old stuff, but the commercial credibility. Hard to believe this one's so different--busier, relying on band and backup rather than the acuity of Brown's singing. Hard to believe it's so alive--until you play the damn thing, which only slackens to make room for the latest edition of ""Man's World.""

FALSE,B+,Nonstop!,James Brown,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4464,"
Titles like ""Popcorn 80's,"" ""Love 80's,"" ""Super Bull/Super Bad,"" ""I Go Crazy,"" signal a contract-fulfilling rehash, but this time he's rehashing the right stuff in the right way--the horn charts and rhythm arrangements are as tricky and on the one as in any newfangled funk you want to name. Most of the sweet ache has disappeared from ""I Go Crazy"" since 1960, and I'm not going to claim that the successfully renegotiated tempo makes up for it. But it is a consolation.
"
FALSE,B+,Bring It On,James Brown,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4465,"
The fast side is honorable and dispensable--great title riff plus filler, nothing anyone who owns some early-'70s JB is likely to need or even want, though neophytes will dance to it now. The slow side comprises the three strongest covers Brown's released since he stuck a classic ""Kansas City"" onto Everybody's Doin' the Hustle in 1975. He still approaches high notes with the caution of someone who's hoarse as indelibly as he's black and proud, but he's emoting like he wants you to believe ""Tennessee Waltz"" and ""For Your Precious Love"" and in between comes ""The Right Time,"" which isn't really slow at all and features a Brownette who approaches any kind of note as if she owns it.

His wailing purist intensity closer to Hank than to any of the proud Hank fans who made him a gamble worth taking, Brown damn near gets across on sound alone and damn near makes it. Just before you've had it with ""I'll Climb Any Mountain"" (guess what he'll swim any), you realize he was astute enough to expend one of his few decent tunes on it. But soon you also notice that the chorus of ""Every Now and Then,"" which you went along with because it was fast, does actually go: ""Like a thief in the night/It cuts like a knife."" Imagine Hank without hits. Pray Brown gets the knack, or buys himself a few.

FALSE,B+,Running on Empty,Jackson Browne,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6491,"
Out of the studio--this was recorded on tour--Jackson sounds relaxed verbally, vocally, even instrumentally. He cuts his own meager melodies with nice ones by Danny O'Keefe and Danny Kortchmar. He does a funny and far from uncritical version of ""Cocaine"" and a loving and far from unfunny version of ""Stay."" I consider this his most attractive album. But his devotees may consider the self-effacement a deprivation.

FALSE,B+,Time Out,The Dave Brubeck Quartet,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15837,"
Inspired by a State Department-backed Eurasian tour and released in 1959, Brubeck's all-time bestseller is supposedly where he and drummer Joe Morello explore exotic Oriental time signatures, although near as most of us can tell it's got a lot of waltzes whether they're in 3/4 or 6/4. The big exceptions are the two classics: Brubeck's ""Blue Rondo A La Turk,"" in 9/8 even though it's a (bluesy) rondo, a sonatalike form invented by the exotic French, and Desmond's ""Take Five,"" in 5/4, steadied by a stubborn Brubeck vamp and covered wherever folks were cool: Stan Getz, Chet Atkins, Grover Washington, Rodrigo y Gabriela. While some say Morello doesn't swing enough, he's an inventive colorist, and as waltzes go, most of the remaining originals combine composition and propulsion with crowd-pleasing panache.

FALSE,B+,Things We Like,Jack Bruce,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6492,"
Recorded in Cream's heyday with John McLaughlin on guitar, Jon Hiseman on drums, and Dick Heckstall-Smith on saxophones, this has zip to do with rock or ""jazz-rock""--it's an enjoyable contemporary jazz LP that owes more to Ornette Coleman and to bebop than to the simplistic modalism favored by most rockers. McLaughlin would be a find if Miles Davis hadn't found him in the meantime, and Bruce's playing is deft when it's solid and contained when it's stormy. His compositions are less notable--only ""Hckhh Blues"" stands up next to the tune borrowed from Milt Jackson and Mel Torme. But the real surprises are Hiseman and Heckstall-Smith, now kingpins of the infamous jazz-rock big band Colosseum, Hiseman because he's serviceable and Heckstall-Smith because he's a pleasure--his melodies striking, his eclecticism intelligent and strong-willed. The thinness of his tone, however, is frustrating--he is the lead voice, after all.

This fluent, affluent rumination on the price of sin and the wages of success really isn't how they do it in L.A. anymore, which must be why I had such a hassle getting a handle on it. Moral signposts are provided by the covers: rock and roll ""It Was I"" (love is painful), pop ""September Song"" (and the most precious thing there is), country ""A Satisfied Mind"" (so be thankful for what you've got). Now if only Lindsey didn't spend so much time flexing his archness, all this might be perceptible to the naked ear.

Like most rappers, Richard Terfry sings at his peril, and like most rappers, he's better off with made beats than played ones. Nevertheless, with occasional input from Tortoise and D-Styles, he and two Halifax pals reclaim the sonic legacy of Serge Gainsbourg. His growly flow confuses Afrocentrists, and there's a chance the guy ""who can't tell the difference between real art and high kitsch"" will prove to be Terfry himself. But even free-associating he can outrhyme 99 percent of the spitters who've never heard of him, and every time the one about the goldfish comes up it's clear he has more stories to tell.

I value my time too much to mess with downloads on spec, but knowing me for a fan, Nova Scotian rap mutant Rich Terfry was slick enough to burn me three untracked one-hour CDs. These have been good by now for five-six spins apiece, usually as background music--as my wife will vouch, they're excellent for sharing breakfast or settling down to sleep. The beats are basic and original--dig that bluegrass, that koto, that Shadowy thrum. Ever the wordslinger, Buck is usually rhyming, and usually worth hearing when you direct your ears his way: ""Hooker in a mink coat died on a Friday/Crappy UFO on the side of the highway,"" ""Can't make sense of the menu I'm readin'/Mistakenly playin' the wrong venue in Sweden."" We'll find out whether there are Real Songs here when he releases a Real Album. I just hope he salvages the 50 Cent dis 42 minutes into the second disc, where he IDs his philosophy of hip-hop as Italian neo-realism as opposed to MGM. ""I created a religion based on wild misinterpretation,"" he raps. ""Dancing is not important to me--you got a problem with that?""

Everybody's (everyman's) (everystar's?) favorite girlfriend gets production from Rick Derringer and Ric Ocasek on material originating with Love, Tom Petty, Iggy Pop, and--the biggest winner, no doubt because it's the biggest obscurity--the Nightcrawlers, whose ""Little Black Egg"" went local in L.A. circa 1967. Those who complain about the size of her voice would probably do the same about her tits. I say she sings with a courtesan's confidence and intend a compliment.

Recorded July 1, 1998, a 78-minute double-CD proves how stiff and thin this made-up collective's mysteriously canonical 1997 studio album is. How? By kicking off with and obliterating the same three songs in the same order, then moving on to a less striking rendition of the lead track from the much better Introducing . . . Ruben Gonzalez. Together for years by then, they're playing off each other and to a crowd--looser, louder, showier, more excited. Yet even so, chief vocalists Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo never leap the language barrier the way pianist Gonzalez does, and if this be the last hurrah of genuine Cuban son, what are those Cooders doing in the mix, and those rumba horns? For too long in the middle, it's just pleasurable exotica-next-door. But then the climactic ""Candela"" goes an extra minute-and-a-half for a reason. And then Ferrer and Portuondo get beautiful.

Buffett's certainly more likable than the average professional rakehell--he's complex, he's honest, he takes good care of his sense of humor, and above all he doesn't come on like a hot shit. This is his most reflective album, and though I'm nothing like him--""Wonder Why We Ever Go Home"" is hardly my take on aging--I find myself interested whenever he stops and thinks, which happens mostly on side one. ""Banana Republics,"" about expatriates reaping the wages (and pleasures) of imperialism even if Buffett would never put it that way, is my favorite, but I also love this breakthrough insight from his breakthrough single: ""Some people claim that there's a woman to blame/But I know it's my own damn fault.""

""In a world that's not so bad,"" Doug Martsch builds a hideout worth visiting--more tree house than basement or cave, with hooks for footholds and misty guitar vistas when you finish the climb.

So when he says, ""You won't help anyone/cause you're unusable,"" he can't possibly be talking about himself. I hope.

They claim jazz so hard that either they're inordinately proud of that stupid flute feature or they don't know what they're doing, which is nailing an instrumental funk situated somewhere between the MG's and the Meters. Master DJ Kid Koala is one crucial attraction--probably supplied the cracker-barrel riffs on their name. Another is rapper James ""Blu Rum 12"" Sobers, whose ""Reverse Psychology"" mines a tradition that goes back to Dr. Hook's ""Levitate.""

In which Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson, and eleven other English folkies redo twelve American songs, and I bet the Silver Beatles loved every one of them. The conjunction brings out the passionately droll in all the principals, especially Denny and Thompson, but the great moments are ""The Loco-Motion,"" with Linda Peters playing Little Eva, and ""Nadine,"" which Tyger Hutchings delivers deadpan, as if reading off cue cards after a quick runthrough.

With the ""Bishop of Soul"" backed by Brenda Bergman's Realtones, this live double from America's premier folkie label looks like an irrelevance, but the D.C. audience signifies otherwise. Burke's singing has lost subtlety rather than power, and since all but two of the twenty-four songs he sets his voice to are relegated to medleys, his reading of specific lyrics aren't the issue so much as the preacherly context he creates for them--the way his monologues connect musically acute texts like ""If You Need Me"" and ""Hold What You've Got"" and ""Down in the Valley"" and ""Gotta Get You Off of My Mind"" to the facts of love in a world where women sign their own welfare checks.

With his fondness for the grand gesture, I just knew Burke was going to build the hushed title cut to a crescendo, but instead of trivializing the song with a false resolution he maintains its tension for seven minutes. That's the triumph, but the same level of taste prevails--this is a modern soul album that engages the material at hand instead of pimping for reactionaries. And with contributions from the likes of Paul Kelly and Jimmy Lewis, the material is worth engaging.

Burnett's foray into straight country is right purty, but it could stand to get a little bent. Abjuring strings, backup choruses, trap sets, puns, and sales potential, it takes the neo out of neotraditionalism, and though I smiled when T-Bone bought his baby ""clothes of rayon,"" I was disturbed to realize that even his synthetics are ensconced in the past.

Marcus Garvey dub, with the instrumental tracks remixed to create illusions of depth and focus. I know two people who consider it one of the great reggae albums, and oddly enough neither is a doper. Odd because, though I'm not much of a doper myself, I find that marijuana greatly enhances appreciation of this music. Which makes sense--marijuana certainly enhanced its creation as well.

Ever more delicate backup horns subsume ever more docile backup vocals as his unearthly outcries grow more coaxing, less admonitory. But the end is the same: Winston Rodney is so synchronic that in 1982 he gives up pretty much the same trancy buzz as in 1976. He's just less excited about it.

FALSE,B+,People of the World,Burning Spear,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4482,"
Like many angry young men before him, Winston Rodney has mellowed with the gathering years and assets. And like many angry young men before him, he's surrendered some edge. Innate musicality plus the right cushy production will sometimes benefit victims of this syndrome, and here he finds the formula, keyed to a horn section that happens to comprise three American women. So all hail unity and the honorable disc-race.

Burton's only competition among nouveau rockabilly composers is the Blasters' Dave Alvin, and like almost anyone with a knack for song form in 1982 he's flexible. In fact, his only remaining link to pure rockabilly is a fondness for novelty numbers like the factual ""Rabies Shots"" and the utterly heretical ""Breathe for Me, Presley!,"" and in the end his sense of humor is his limitation. In rock and roll of any kind you have to sing better than Robert Klein.

The Hiccups make with good old guitar, bass, and drums while Charlie fakes some rockabilly up front, and when it works it's quite catchy in an utterly received sort of way. The conservatism isn't annoying or boring because although Charlie loves this music--listen to ""One Man's Trash""--he doesn't give a damn for roots or form. He just wants to write some songs. I'm not sorry he doesn't share my liberal respect for Vietnam and world hunger, and when he diddleybops through his parents' coronaries I know why. Inspirational Verse: ""Water's thick, but blood is thicker/Daddy (Mommy) had a bum, bum ticker.""

FALSE,B+,Minimum Wage Rock & Roll,Bus Boys,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4486,"
They climax with their own ""Respect,"" which climaxes ""If you don't like rock 'n' roll music you can kiss my ass."" And they mean it, man, though their idea of rock 'n' roll--AOR guitar breaks, rhythms less funky than Jeff Porcaro's or Don Christensen's, harmonies that owe the Beach Boys and Steely Dan--is too uncool to break through the prejudices of the hipsters prone to cheer five blacks and a Chicano for putting it out. Sometimes they aim too straight for the charts, but when they play their existential joke--speaking up for dishwashers and shoeshine boys, for blacks who think immigrants are destroying the neighborhood and blacks who win one for the coach and blacks who join the Klan so they can join a band--I say cool. Inspirational Verse: ""Bet you never heard music like this by spades.""

FALSE,B+,American Worker,Bus Boys,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4487,"
At first I was no more impressed by this professional black arena-rock than I am by, say, professional lesbian folk-rock. Less, actually--bombast is annoying. But in the end I was disarmed by the audacity, esprit, and sheer versatility--not many arena-rockers are comfortable simulating funk, reggae, and surf music--and won over by the songs themselves, every one informed by the kind of middle-American compassion you might expect from a black band with enough soul to hope to touch the arena-rock masses.
"
FALSE,B+,The Best of Johnny Bush,Johnny Bush,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6517,"
When Bush's hurting, almost operatic baritone strains against Tommy Hill's spare, hard, danceable arrangements, you begin to suspect that God did make honky-tonk angels after all--male ones. Now if only all of Bush's hosannas were as terse and colloquial as the three Willie Nelson songs here. Hyperbolic corn can work in country music--Bush's dramatization of Marty Robbins's ""You Gave Me a Mountain"" brings a catch to the throat and a tear to the eye. But too often the corn here is as commonplace as Bush's big legit move, a cover of ""All in the Game.""
"
FALSE,B+,The Dreaming,Kate Bush,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4488,"
The most impressive Fripp/Gabriel-style art-rock album of the postpunk refulgence makes lines like ""I love life"" and ""Some say knowledge is something that you never have"" say something. Part of the reason is that Bush is flaky enough to seek the higher plane in ""a hired plane,"" although as you might expect the resulting analysis often crumbles under scrutiny. It also helps that the emotional range of her singing sometimes approaches its physical range, although when it doesn't you'd best duck. But the revelation is the dense, demanding music, which gets the folk exoticism of current art-rock fashion out of mandolins and uillean pipes and didgeridoos rather than clumsy polyrhythms, and goes for pop outreach with hooks rather than clumsy polyrhythms.
"
FALSE,B+,Fashion Maswedi,Mzikayifani Buthelezi,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4492,"
A traditionally raised country Zulu, he sings like he's calling cattle or berating his six wives while his brother saws away on concertina or violin and groups of wives and male underlings muscle up to the mike. Pretty raw even for mbaqanga, and pretty repetitive, too--Jo'burg rhythm pros provide the now-familiar four-four. But familiarity doesn't flatten the overall intensity--instead, Buthelezi's wail demonstrates its character. If someone had bothered to pick and choose from his 100-plus titles instead of rereleasing an old album, he might end up more than a strange name in a catalogue.
"
FALSE,B+,Easy Life,Chris Butler,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16253,"
It has its slow spots, especially on a few fast-forwards from 1970, but this cobbled-together concept album by a long-scrabbling professional on the rock fringe earns its subtitle: ""The Bohemian Dream &amp; American Nightmare of Kent State 1970."" The buoyant title track evokes the late-hippie mindset as accurately as Neil Young's melancholy ""Don't Let It Bring You Down,"" and the surrounding historical detail powers an acute portrait of a movement that was simultaneously casual and righteous--a movement of young people who'd never seen their world contract and couldn't believe it actually might. Part one of the long tale that ends the album proper climaxes with a road trip to see the Dead in Cleveland, during which Butler sneaks onstage and plays beer can until Jerry tells him to shut the fuck up. In part two, the bummed-out kid gives his drum kit to Jeff Miller three weeks before Miller becomes one of four Kent State students slaughtered by the Ohio National Guard on May 4, 1970. The postscript is Creedence's ""Fortunate Son,"" which lest you've forgotten is about not being one.
"
FALSE,B+,It All Comes Back,Paul Butterfield's Better Days,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6524,"
In which Butter returns to his own better days, when his miraculously unaffected but colorless singing provided pleasant valleys from which his weirdo sidemen could peak. The prize here is Geoff Muldaur's rendition of Bobby Charles's ""Small Town Talk,"" a song about back-stabbers that sounds as if it was made for the exurban bohemian community where the music originated--probably because that's the community it was written about. Ronnie Barron's frenetic remake of his own ""Louisiana Flood"" comes in second.
"
FALSE,B+,Psychic . . . Powerless . . . Another Man's Sac,The Butthole Surfers,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3513,"
Truly repulsive music imposes the most stringent of aesthetic standards--who wants to listen if it's just good? So while I'm sort of impressed by the (relative) accessibility of their first full-length LP--guitar that might actually win over some wayward metal freak seeking X-rated thrills--I must report that only ""Lady Sniff,"" punctuated by perfectly timed gobs, pukes, farts, belches, and Mexican radio, lives up to ""The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's Grave.""
"
FALSE,B+,A Different Kind of Tension,Buzzcocks,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3518,"
I suppose people call them a pop band because they still write about love, but that they say ""I can't love you"" rather than the usual does make a difference. Not in profundity--one sentiment is as banal as the other--but in a mood that suits a sound as bright and abrasive as new steel wool. Pete Shelley articulates his truisms with insight as well as flair, especially in ""You Say You Don't Love Me"" and ""I Believe."" My favorite, though, is Steve Diggle's ""You Know You Can't Help It,"" about sex, which I'm happy to report he likes--although he does observe that ""love makes war."" Hey, does it?
"
FALSE,B+,Ballad of Easy Rider,The Byrds,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10964,"
I'm sorry to report that this is the poorest Byrds album. It improves with listening, especially at high volume, but Roger McGuinn does seem to be returning to his roots, which unfortunately lie deep in commercial folk music. All the rock dynamics are fading, and what replaces them is thoughtful but not compelling.
"
FALSE,B+,Do the Boomerang: The Music of Junior Walker,Don Byron,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13419,"
First: Sounds grrreat. Then: Who needs this arty clarinetist with Walker's gutbucket sax a click away? Finally: Terrific modern jazz-funk record ������������������ la Hank Crawford, with just enough just-funky-enough vocals to counteract Byron's smooth tone on sax. Check th""Shotgun"" on Walker's Millennium Collection or Ultimate Collection, then the Rodney Holmes syncopations beneath Byron's version. Benjamin is a titan and Holmes isn't. But Holmes has heard James Brown, and the change'll do you good.
"
FALSE,B+,Sex and Soul,Roy C.,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6530,"
Roy Hammond is a driven artist--he cut this in his garage--and his compulsiveness comes out in the lyrics; despite convincing asides about racism and Vietnam, his title ought to be Infidelity and Suffering. The songs are raw and outspoken, and the suffering's in the voice even more than the words--he strains its paradoxically mellow limits sometimes, so seekers after the Perfect Note should seek elsewhere. But old Swamp Dogg fans will put aside their feminist reservations and learn how the other half lives.
"
FALSE,B+,Special Edition,J.J. Cale,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4494,"
When he came up, Cale seemed one more carrier of the laid-back contagion, but fifteen years later, with the contagion dispersed into the adult-contemporary ether and its carriers in hock up to their souls, you have to respect him for the principled bluesman he's proven to be. Principled, but distinctly minor--only convinced narcoleptics want the complete set. The rest of us will be happy to stop at this compilation, though we'd be happier if it didn't pass up ""Call Me the Breeze"" and ""I Got the Same Old Blues"" for more up-to-date entries.
"
FALSE,B+,Paris 1919,John Cale,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1759,"
In which Cale subsumes Little Feat, the academy in stasis, and other subversive elements into a form known generically (don't tell anyone) as schlock-rock. Winsome stuff it is, too--delectable melodies, dulcet singing, and such civilized rhymes as ""Andalucia"" and ""see ya."" But when you try to get past the surface pleasure of phrases like ""claim you with my iron drum"" and ""cows that agriculture won't allow"" you realize that poets who emulate Edward Lear had better be funny about it--or else stick with Delmore Schwartz.
"
FALSE,B+,Honi Soit,John Cale,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12060,"
After a mere eight months of diligent listening I've concluded that Cale's fans were right--his songwriting has regained its adroitness. And after a mere eight minutes of random thought I've concluded that I was right too--his singing hasn't.
"
FALSE,B+,Los de Atras Vienen Conmigo,Calle 13,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14353,"
You don't have to speak Spanish to conclude that this arty, political San Juan rap duo deserve their rocketing reputation--I sure can't, though when I squint at the booklet my puny recognition vocabulary helps. But you do have to immerse and concentrate--and accept that you'll miss most of what's going on even then. They're reggaeton only by association, a lot further from Daddy Yankee's hey-mami dancehall than the Roots were from Dr. Dre's jeep-pimping funk. By all accounts and the little I can work out, their lyrics are playfully associative and outrageously filthy. But for gringos, their humor resides almost entirely in Visitante's out-there arrangements and Residente's overt vocal comedy, as on the Balkanized ""Fiesta de Locos."" If some promotional visionary were to provide trots, that might change. But as it is, big guests Caf������������������ Tacuba and Ruben Blades are too mainstream to launch C"
FALSE,B+,Style,Cameo,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4498,"
It never peaks, which means it'll never be as hot a party record as the A side of Alligator Woman, but this on-the-one cartoon (cf. Slave's Showtime) is an all-round showcase for syndrum natural Larry Blackmon, funk's most underutilized resource. Keyb man Charles Singleton does smart stuff with the slow stuff by covering ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" and making something of the atmospheric ""Interlude (Serenity)."" Maybe next time they'll only abandon their God-given tempo to sex it up heavy like on ""Slow Movin'.""
"
FALSE,B+,Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart,Camper Van Beethoven,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=528,"
Suddenly these postmodern postfolkie weirdos are transformed into, of all things, a rock band--sans chops. And unfortunately, chops are an issue: both the one-dimensional matter-of-factness of the vocal concept and the time-keeping world-beat-by-numbers of the rhythmic philosophy stick out of Dennis Herring's honest AOR production, which messes up the band's balance even though it leaves everything but the mix untouched. Beneath this disorienting surface the message continues its evolution toward postanomie, and it would be a kick to hear ""Life Is Grand,"" say, on the radio. Not AOR, though--college radio, where the nay-sayers it's aimed at call the shots.
"
FALSE,B+,Key Lime Pie,Camper Van Beethoven,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=529,"
After an instrumental establishes the band's voice, out march four amazing songs--two literal, two associative, all smart, ambitious, eccentric, eloquent, unassuming, compassionate, and cognizant of history. Music's a more forceful version of their by now homey-sounding bouzouki-rock, and when the country-rock guitar hook snakes professionally out of the associative ""Sweet Hearts"" it makes sense somehow. But on an album they call ""bittersweet""--""not gloomy, but moody""--those four songs are pretty much it. ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"" smirks cheerfully at hippie nostalgia, and ""All Her Favorite Fruit"" is all those good adjectives. But both are swamped by music that's not gloomy, not moody, just lugubrious; the big drumbeats evoke nothing so much as the gong at a Chinese funeral. They knew better back when skinhead jokes were funny.
"
FALSE,B+,The Spotlight Kid,Captain Beefheart,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=537,"
Cap's much-bruited commercial bid turns out to have all the mass appeal of King of the Delta Blues Singers, complete with modernized terraplane and an avowal of primitivism in which the Kid threatens to ""Grow Fins."" All the primordial themes are here--sex, love, poverty, destiny, ecology--and the Howlin' Wolf imitations are as dense and heartfelt as the music. Still, Robert Johnson cuts him, and primitivism is rarely better the second time around. Maybe the Stones could cover ""I'm Gonna Booglarize You Baby."" But if this were all it's cracked up to be, that wouldn't be the only candidate.
"
FALSE,B+,I'm Going to Do What I Wanna Do: Live at My Father's Place,Captain Beefheart,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=543,"
Title protestations to the contrary, Don Van Vliet promos like a good touring artist should, supporting a near-great album that 22 years later has left the catalog (for the nonce) as nine de facto bonus tracks reprise his illustrious underground career. Live on this November night, his music was slacker and more forceful than on the studio Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller). His anointed helpers weren't improvisers, not hardly. But they were a fairly magic band.
"
FALSE,B+,Trout Mask Replica,Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10873,"
I find it impossible to give this record an A because it is just too weird. But I'd like to. Very great played at high volume when you're feeling shitty, because you'll never feel as shitty as this record.
"
FALSE,B+,Clear Spot,Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=536,"
This one really does rock out--it's got the Blackberries, horn charts, everything the promotion department could ask except a hummable tune. Much womanizing, of course--rather less, er, allusive than usual but laced with the unexpected, as in the title ""Nowadays a Woman's Gotta Hit a Man,"" a prescription from which Cap exempts himself. But what makes it work is that it really rocks out.
"
FALSE,B+,Mirror Man,Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6542,"
Recorded one night in 1965, these four pieces, which go on for more than fifty minutes, seem insultingly sloppy and thin at first--lacking Beefheart's later rhythmic assurance and aural density. But in their linear way they're pretty crazy and pretty involving. Makes you wonder why the Captain got left out of all the blues jams that followed in his wake.
"
FALSE,B+,First Band on the Moon,The Cardigans,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3522,"
Popper-than-thou aggregation backs cute blonde for fun and profit. Think Blondie. They're Swedish. Think Abba. They're Euroalt-by-default. Think, er, Bettie Serveert. Only nowadays, anythinger-than-thou commits you to that extra mile, so that these reformed metalheads make their Beatle move a la Black Velvet Flag. And since metalheads can really, how you say it, play their axes, they also score some funny Black Sabbath covers. As for the blonde, alt types were calling her dark even back when she was imitating a love doll. Me, I prefer her now that she's imitating a cynical young woman--especially since the metalheads provide dissonances suitable to her self-critical rhetoric, which greatly smartens their flute and tinkle.
"
FALSE,B+,KMAG YOYO,Hayes Carll,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15271,"
A little too decisively to instill much hope for his love life, the rowdy songs are deeper than the thoughtful ones, especially the duet with Young Republican Cary Ann Hearst, who thinks she might screw him even though he can't afford to tip the stripper. But he does rowdy real good. And the filial ""Grateful for Christmas"" enters the canon of alt-country unholiday songs well ahead of the Drive-Bys' competing entry--maybe even on a level with James McMurtry's and Robert Earl Keen's.
"
FALSE,B+,Just a Passing Change,Don Carlos,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4502,"
Although Carlos isn't as consistent as ranking romeo Gregory Isaacs, his peaks--the title tune, in which he glimpses Selassie's ghost from behind modest dub and haunting horns, and ""I Just Can't Stop,"" in which he flees Babylon till the break of dawn--bliss out the way true spiritual pop should. They lift the gracefully ordinary tunes way up even if three generically anonymous closers drag side two back down.
"
FALSE,B+,Take Me to the Limit,James Carr,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1647,"
Most of Carr's legend is in his voice, a great grave thing that doesn't so much interpret his best material as haunt it, and for as long as the songs on this album hold out the voice holds out too--even on the lighthearted ""Sugar Shock."" I think that's how it works, anyway--all I can swear is that somewhere around cut seven the proceedings thicken uncomfortably and then grind to a near-halt. Since the rest of Carr's legend revolves around his long periods of seclusion, I attributed the undistanced commitment of his rare, recent live show to the fact that he'd never sung his great songs into the ground. Having since located this record, I now suspect that some of those I thought I'd forgotten were new. ""Take Me to the Limit"" and ""She's Already Gone"" are squarely in the obsessive tradition of ""Dark End of the Street,"" which belonged to him first.

FALSE,B+,Tex-Mex Rock-Roll,"Joe ""King"" Carrasco and El Molino",1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1735,"
Like the Western swing it rocks and rolls, Tex-Mex is an acquired taste--often a little lightweight, but say that in the wrong bar in Austin and things might get heavy. Anyway, this is the real stuff, more striking than anything on Augie Meyers's dependable Texas Re-Cord Company label mostly because Carrasco writes songs of no special significance that might just as well have originated on the Rio Grande 100 years ago. Favorite titles: ""Jalapeno con Big Red"" and ""Rock Esta Noche.""
"
FALSE,B+,Catholic Boy,The Jim Carroll Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4507,"
Two big differences between Jim and Patti--Patti has no jump shot and Jim's a boy. Hence the title, I know, 'cept women get away with this kind of fringe/decadent hero/survivor myth/boaster better than men--it's fresher for them, not such a line. Face it, Jim's a phony--a moral weakling who's been charming suckers ever since he ran away from home. And if that's not the end of it, well, charming suckers takes talent--a lot easier to get by tending bar. He's got a great eye, a great memory, great connections. He knows how to put himself across. And he wrote ""People Who Died.""
"
FALSE,B+,The Cars,The Cars,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3524,"
Ric Ocasek writes catchy, hardheaded-to-coldhearted songs eased by wryly rhapsodic touches, the playing is tight and tough, and it all sounds wonderful on the radio. But though on a cut-by-cut basis Roy Thomas Baker's production adds as much as it distracts, here's hoping the records get rawer. That accentuated detachment may feel like a Roxy Music move in the first flush of studio infatuation, but schlock it up a little and this band really could turn into an American Queen.
"
FALSE,B+,Candy-O,The Cars,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3525,"
Hooks are mechanical by nature, but the affectlessness of these deserves special mention; only listeners who consider ""alienation is the craze"" a great insight will find much meaning here. On the other hand, only listeners who demand meaning in all things will find this useless. Cold and thin, shiny and hypnotic, it's what they do best--rock and roll that is definitely pop without a hint of cuteness. Which means that for them ""alienation is the craze"" may be a meaningful statement after all.
"
FALSE,B+,Heartbeat City,The Cars,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4511,"
With hooks recurring as predictably as zebras on a carousel or heartbeats in a city, the glossy approach the Cars invented has made this the best year for pure pop in damn near twenty, and it's only fair that they should return so confidently to form. They still don't have much to say and they're still pretty arch about it, but that's no reason for anybody to get unduly bothered, and neither is Greg Hawkes's Fairlight.
"
FALSE,B+,Sixty Minutes With Clarence Carter,Clarence Carter,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6551,"
The title has nothing to do with the record's duration--it's yet another play on this soul survivor's back-door-man routine. But thanks to Rich Hall's confident cop of the Allmans' high lick and an unusual things-ain't-getting-better lyric from George Jackson, a lot of this is more than routine.
"
FALSE,B+,At the Crossroads,James Carter Organ Trio,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15663,"
This occasional unit's live 2005 Out of Nowhere was a honking session, beefing up the young world-champeen multisaxer with Hamiet Bluiett's bari master class and Blood Ulmer's harmolodic Son House shtick. The most luscious beef on this more contained studio job is provided by guest singer Miche Braden sinking her chops into Fluffy Hunter's playfully filthy ""Walking Blues"" and a lounge through Muddy Waters's ""Ramblin' Blues."" The lounge feel is shored up by sometime guitarist Bruce Edwards, who if he ain't Ulmer at least ain't Jim Hall. Gotta admit it's a relief, though, when sometime guitarist Brandon Ross disrupts the long Julius Hemphill-penned closer. Even the organist, who does his job manfully throughout and whose name is Gerard Gibbs, avants around on that one.
"
FALSE,B+,Hell-On,Neko Case,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17332,"
Lyrically and melodically, Case has never been more accessible or accomplished. Emotionally, however, she's as distant as ever, and no longer inclined to soften that fact with a reassuring scrim of obscurism. Like her, you may well think God is a tire fire and petroleum an offense against the organic life it exploits and destroys. But that won't make the two of you allies--she rides alone. Here she's smartest and most effective memorializing a family friend who abused children without assaulting them sexually or physically, rendering him the proximate cause of ""Curse of the I-5 Corridor"" and its devastated ""So I left home and faked my ID/And fucked every man that I wanted to be.""
"
FALSE,B+,Johnny Cash Is Coming to Town,Johnny Cash,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4515,"
I'd have let his contract lapse too--the pathetic Class of '55 proved he was a has-been, huzzahs and all. But he was holding a few in reserve, like definitive Elvis Costello and Guy Clark, overdue James Talley and (why did nobody ever think of this?) Ernie Ford, and the song-factory prizes any Nashvillean with a mind to can turn up: ""The Night Hank Williams Came to Town,"" a hit, and ""Heavy Metal (Don't Mean Rock and Roll to Me),"" recommended to Mikhail Gorbachev for Goskino's next tractor movie. And then there are the two originals, which convince me he's still a has-been.
"
FALSE,B+,Out Among the Stars,Johnny Cash,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16127,"
The main reason you marvel that material this good was left in the can for 30 years is how many country albums settle for less. But the main reason the material itself astonishes is that Cash is so on his game in what was historically a fallow, coming-down-again biographical moment. In one novelty he gets it on with a chivalrously unnamed Minnie Pearl; in another, he puts a hundred bucks down on a Cadillac and drives it off a cliff on his last date with his ex-wife. Two love songs achieve high seriousness without whispering mawk. And Cash gets so much more out of Adam Mitchell's death-by-cop title song than Merle Haggard or Hazel Dickens. His natural gravity helps. But n.b., Rick Rubin: so does his possession of his bottomless pit of a voice.
"
FALSE,B+,Seven Year Ache,Rosanne Cash,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3012,"
It's a tribute to persistence of something-or-other that somebody should still be getting decent music out of the sterile studio-rock formula. What that something-or-other might be is perhaps indicated by the identity of the somebody, who is second-generation pro rather than a punk revoloo.
"
FALSE,B+,Somewhere in the Stars,Rosanne Cash,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4517,"
That ""Third Rate Romance"" is the least impressive thing here is proof enough of Cash's continuing growth--""Third Rate Romance"" is damn near impossible to ruin, and she doesn't come close. But since I was never much of a Ronstadtian myself, I can't quite make the leap from admiring the assured warmth and easy precision of Linda's de facto successor to inviting her over.

FALSE,B+,Cee-Lo Green . . . Is the Soul Machine,Cee-Lo,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12334,"
The intro, where he refuses to start until he's done chuckling over the failure of his baby boy to pronounce ""soul machine,"" sums up a guy neither as humble nor as special as he thinks. Half God's gift to hip-hop, half man of the people, he never quite puts all his good tracks together or across. These include trademarked Timbaland and Ludacris collabs, love song and friend song and antigangsta rave, the one at the beginning where he wishes he ""could write one song to right all wrongs"" (which who wouldn't?) and the one at the end where he swears he'll ""die trying"" to do just that (which he won't).

FALSE,B+,Quintessentially Yours,The Celibate Rifles,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4518,"
All right, they do lash out with a nice, nasty buzz--reminds me of those long-lost speed boys the Vibrators. But no pretenders who take most of their 1985 Yank debut from their 1983 Aussie debut and none of it from the follow-up are getting any rock and roll future awards from me.

FALSE,B+,Love in C Minor,Cerrone,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6558,"
Catchy tracks, a remake of ""Black Is Black,"" and a new standard in disco porn--the protagonist brings three women to simultaneous orgasm while keeping one finger on the ""Door Close"" button.
"
FALSE,B+,Check In,The Chalets,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13645,"
Big in Ireland, where this album is 2 years old, two gals and three guys prove a little too cute and through-conceived to fully exploit the innocence of the ""Two Chord Song,"" as their most compelling number is entitled. But excellent gender conflicts bedeck their well-enunciated lyrics, and if you can imagine yourself being unable to resist a chorus that goes ""I know you love me but you're f***ing crazy/I know you love me but you're f***ing crazy,"" you definitely won't resist this one.
"
FALSE,B+,The Captain,Kasey Chambers,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1882,"
If the voice doesn't get you, what can I say--you're not me, and you're also not a whole bunch of other people. Its burred drawl is deep country like Iris DeMent; its little-girl timbre evokes Dolly Parton and whispers Lolita. It's utterly arresting, and as soon as it warbles, ""I never lived through the Great Depression/Sometimes I feel as though I did,"" you want to kiss her. Of course, when it gets to ""I'm not much like my generation/Their music only hurts my ears,"" you may wish you'd pulled her nose instead. And when you learn that her ""southern kind of life"" took place in southern Australia--the cold part, noted for its drawl--you begin to suspect she's Gillian Welch without the death trip. You notice that her arrangements are slick country-rock, that her worldview is old hat, that you don't even know what the catchy title number means. So better not give your heart to this AC-ready 24-year-old-not yet. But by all means enjoy her voice and hum her tunes, which are delicious as music and dazzling as aesthetic constructions. And invest your hopes in the two kiss-offs--one to a boyfriend, the other to the world.

FALSE,B+,Modern Heart,Champaign,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4520,"
This clean, middle-American pop-funk's commitment to quality is so modest that its ""concept"" may well be not to stand out. So it takes forever to penetrate. But where most merely professional tunesmiths get irritating with prolonged exposure, Champaign start to glow--modestly, of course.

FALSE,B+,Stroll on With the Duke,Gene Chandler,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11450,"
How bitterly you bewail Chandler's relative obscurity depends on how unconditionally you credit Curtis Mayfield's genius. Me, I consider the Chicago sound second-city and don't find Chandler especially adept at negotiating the turns of the seven Mayfield songs on this admirably consistent early-'60s collection. Only the live ""Rainbow '65"" stands out like Jerry Butler's ""Bless Our Love"" or Bernice Williams's ""Festival of Love"" and ""The Big Lie."" And lest you suspect otherwise, Chandler never came close to topping ""Duke of Earl.""

FALSE,B+,The Glow of Love,Change,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4522,"
""New and true and gay,"" this gold album confirms disco's continuing autonomy as a market and as a style. From the Rodgers-&amp;-Edwards rip of ""A Lover's Holiday"" to the good ole Giorgio Moroder of ""The End,"" here's the complete bag of tricks. Luther Vandross's best Teddy Pendergrass impression doesn't redeem the militantly escapist lyrics and probably isn't meant to. But ""It's a Girl's Affair,"" sung by Jocelyn Shaw, is a softcore treat--and spell that ""Girls'"" on your next printing, please.
"
FALSE,B+,Miracles,Change,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4523,"
Where their debut took off from its moments of raunch, this is pure fantasy fare--the you-can-work-it-out advisories ""Hold Tight,"" ""Your Move,"" and ""Stop for Love"" never get down (to details), and ""On Top,"" ""Heaven of My Life,"" ""Paradise,"" and ""Miracles"" aren't exactly realistic (note titles). But what a terrific fantasy--so bright and casual and full of life. The hip punch of Mauro Malavasi's keyboards puts the dream in motion, and Diva Gray's lithe, modest vocals bring it to bed.

FALSE,B+,Tracy Chapman,Tracy Chapman,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4030,"
""Fast Car"" is so far-seeing, ""Mountains o' Things"" so necessary, that it's doubly annoying when she puts her name on begged questions like ""Why"" and ""Talkin' Bout a Revolution."" Maybe I should be heartened and so forth that Intelligent Young People are once again pushing naive left-folkie truisms, but she's too good for such condescension--even sings like a natural. Get real, girl.

FALSE,B+,A Message From the People,Ray Charles,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5275,"
Beginning with ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" an anthem sung by black schoolchildren, and climaxing with ""America the Beautiful,"" ditto but with less reason, Charles says his piece. Like the ecologist he is, he extracts all remaining truth from ""Abraham, Martin and John,"" and though he may be naive he adds a menace to ""Heaven Help Us All"" that Stevie Wonder wasn't genius enough to convey and turns Melanie's ""What Have They Done to My Song, Ma"" into the outcry of black musicians everywhere--which is probably why it rocks (and swings) like nothing he's done in years.

The problem with this Norman Granz brainstorm is Laine, a singer of formidable technique and zero soul who usually gives me tension headaches. But though she's nothing to write liner notes about, only rarely does her unnaturalness intrude--and she does do a great job with the score itself, which is no snap. Charles isn't always inspired--is he ever any more?--but the writing carries him over the smooth spots. Granz deserves credit for holding down the orchestrations and inviting Charles and his combo to improvise on the material. Of course, Granz might also unearth the Porgy and Bess he did twenty years ago with Ella and Louis--as might you. But this will do.

FALSE,B+,In Color,Cheap Trick,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=573,"
Nowadays, punk makes it possible to resist hard rock so slickly textured, but with these guys why bother?

Guess so.

For better or worse, and it's both, this is kind of what you'd figure sort of: a Sonic Youth record dominated by that band's most important member. It's also a record that makes us love Steve Shelley, because John Mooney's drums never propel Thurston past virtual pogo territory--and that says nothing of what a nice change it used to be to have someone besides Thurston sing. Imagine that ""Sleeping Where I Fall"" addresses his former bassist-wife if you want, but believe that the whole album is conceived as a bohemian history lesson. Present and accounted for are a flower child who prefers her music free, a song by Darby Crash, a song about Darby Crash, a song to William S. Burroughs, a song linking Dylan to Frank O'Hara, and ""Groovy &amp; Linda,"" who FYI were real hippie speed freaks surnamed Hutchinson and Fitzpatrick who were murdered in a boiler room two blocks from my apartment in 1967.

FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Cher,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6572,"
Snuff Garrett states her case more loudly than Sonny ever did, and if like me you have a soft spot in your heart for unabashed brass you find her biggest hits irresistible. The great Swarthy Trilogy--""Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves,"" ""Half-Breed,"" and ""Dark Lady""--is proof of an album that cut for cut is as vulgar as any in the post-Beatles era: Grand Funk is more wholesome and more arty, Neil Diamond a rabbi by comparison. She's at least as authentic as Tammy Wynette, too. Not all of these were such big hits, but who cares when one of the ringers is ""Melody,"" the name of an old doll to whom a just-deflowered Cher sings her proud confession.
"
FALSE,B+,Don Cherry,Don Cherry,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11307,"
A clear-eyed charity animates Cherry's three recent albums: Eternal Now (Antilles), dominated by Asian and African folk instruments; Hear &amp; Now (Atlantic), produced with standard electric jazz instrumentation by Narada Michael Walden; and this Eastward-looking acoustic jazz LP. Rather than transporting him into kitschy esoterica or providing an excuse for profitable one-worlder populism, Cherry's religious leanings seem to inspire a gut respect for the uses of musical ritual, whether in a Chinese temple or a movie-theatre-turned-rock-palace, so that he can recycle what is fresh about the folk roots and popular branches of the free-jazz idiom without betraying his own commitment to it. Not that his work isn't marred by rambling passages and received riffs; even this album, featuring musicians like Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins, has its share of sappy moments. But I can't think of a fusion hustler or black Buddhist who couldn't learn something from his sweetness and acuity.

She's marked out a meaningful piece of turf: sophisticated secondhand homegirl, personally decent and artistically accessible, a friend to rely on. But where the lithe beats and uncorny sonics flesh out the concept and jolt every track, the lyrics settle for honest. ""The choice is mine/With my ordinary joy and pain inside"" is up toward the high end, with ""Money talks love is for real"" and ""How long can we be this way"" too typical. Personal to Yo Yo: consider a career in rhyme medicine.

If you're going to live in the past, you might as well go whole hog like Greg Prevost, who in the great blues purist tradition performs only covers--of titles no one but other garage-band collectors has ever heard. The upshot is a seamless archive of quaint adolescent macho, definitive yet utterly negligible protohippie songs rendered by a band whose claim to expertise is the mastery of a dozen marginally distinct varieties of crudity.

Although you'd figure the collaboration would suffer after both Nile and Nard started coming up with good albums of their own, the damage is amazingly slight. The title track, a true song of faith (""Stand back-to-back, believer/Meet head-to-head/Fight toe-to-toe, believer/Dance cheek-to-cheek""), achieves the rough-minded positivity the rest of the album aims for. The true song of praise that comes next is every bit as believable. And the rest is blessing enough in this negative time.

Of course, the Gap ad in question isn't exactly a geek anymore. He's a stand-up comedian bringing intelligent rap to the masses, one one-liner at a time.

""Eight Songs From Eight Members From Eight Phases of the Chills!"" announces this '82-'84 singles comp, extensively annotated for the collectors it's aimed at. And unlike the mid-period Lost EP--next they'll construct an album from work tapes by Martin Phillips's pre-Chills Same--it doesn't bog down in horizon-stretching. These are simple pop songs by young people who are proud they can play them. They're slight, but they have the spirit. Best in show: the meaningless ""Satin Doll,"" which Phillips wrote when he was seventeen--presumably for the Same.

FALSE,B+,Bach's Bottom,Alex Chilton,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=51,"
These 1975 tracks, the best already released on Chilton's long-gone Ork EP, are about as Memphis as a garbage strike. Not only does anarchic equal chaotic equal sloppy equal a mess, but soulful equals spontaneous equals off-the-cuff equals a mess. None of which is to deny that he knows how to mess around.
"
FALSE,B+,No Sex/Under Class/Wild Kingdom,Alex Chilton,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4532,"
Too blocked or tuckered out (from what?) to put a whole album together, the inventor of power pop follows Feudalist Tarts onto the brutalist charts with yet another award-winning shortie. A's an AIDS song: ""Can't get it on or even get high/Come on baby, fuck me and die."" Lead B points out that he's not ""a rich musician."" And while the finale's title promises a summing up, instead it's a real B, with throwaway guitar solo rendering it almost as long as the other two combined. Really does deserve a side all to itself. EPs sure do help you get away with stuff.

FALSE,B+,High Priest,Alex Chilton,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=53,"
Chilton had a chance to lead his little flock back onto the paths of righteousness. In a microcosm where nobody can tell good pop junk from utter shit anymore, his first four cuts are a refresher course: one Slim Harpo let get away, a callow Goffin-King throwaway, his own tasteless Buddhist joke, and ""Volare."" Each the real thing, each different, each undreamed by the Fanzine Filosofy. But after that he lets things slide, from a straight (for him) declaration of love to a Lowell Fulson boogie to covers the Fleshtones could think of. These are parlous times, Alex. Sloppy's getting harder to bring off, and cute ain't enough.

That this longtime DC horn-funk unit ain't Fela's goes without saying. It's also a given that its politics are saner than Fela's. But Michael Skereikis's felt wisdom comes as a considerable surprise. Where so many similar messages come off unthinking, you never doubt that these preoccupy Skereikis as deeply as his music. When he calls his opener ""Questions of Our Day,"" you wouldn't mind if he ran them back again. When ""Tribulation"" winds through a long list of war-torn nations, there are so many you half wish he'd stop. And when he makes the case for DC statehood, you remember that in politics, sanity alone guarantees nothing.

They're too neat--too pop, too heavy metal, too defined--for hardcore purists, but these hooks come the way I like them: one recitative/mechanical handclap/girl response/sound of breaking glass per hyperdriven two-minute song. Too bad they didn't cop more of the EP (say ""Mannequin"" and ""I Got a Gun"" in addition to ""Manzanar""), thus stretching this specially priced but suspiciously unclocked album to customary hardcore length. Approximate time: 22:30.

Like the Angry Samoans, although not as clearly or catchily, these slammers double-time metal riffs behind the rants, yielding such indelible plaints as ""Deny Everything"" (""I'm being framed""), ""Paid Vacation"" (""It's Afghanistan!""), and ""Group Sex"" (sensitive reading from the personals plus screaming title chorus).

The groove is as inspired as this crack band of blues 'n' boogie pros can make it--when Cooder, Lee, Dunn &amp; Hawkins play their hearts out, mere professionalism (also mere boogie) gets left behind, and Clapton's guitar hasn't rung so crisp and clear since Layla. The drawback is that the music is the message, everything Clapton boasts he (""still"") has ""left to say"" on ""Ain't Going Down,"" his only notable new song. If blues power were my idea of God, I might feel a transcendent presence even so. But blues power in itself isn't even my idea of a foxhole.

I liked Clark's laconic vocal presence at first, although I eventually began to feel that, like the agreeably glopless Nashville production, it flattened this material more than it deserved.

My, here's a useful item--replaces three whole tracks from the just-this-minute-deleted Old No. 1, two of them bittersweet love-and-sex songs, with three newer Texas-mythos numbers. Very conceptual, but not exactly an improvement, and I even like two of the new ones: ""Broken Hearted People,"" which is also a bittersweet love-and-sex song, and ""Texas Cookin'."" I also miss the bittersweet love-and-sex song ""Instant Coffee Blues"" very much. Maybe Texas-mythos types understand food better than outlaws--the man has written well about home-grown tomatoes.

Those who (claim to) expect them to improve on Gramsci maintain that this is where they turn bozo once and for all. I counter that they're well ahead of a lot of respectable competition--the babble surrounding Robert De Niro on ""Red Angel Dragnet,"" for instance, may well be the first evidence ever that Taxi Driver has something real to say about urban oppression. Neither their funk nor their tone-poem dub has gained much pizzazz since Sandinista!, where both were easier to avoid. But I guarantee that they're not sinking into the pop slime--they're evolving, and here's hoping that someday they write songs as terse and clear as ""Janie Jones"" at this higher level of verbal, musical, and political density.

Since I play the much-maligned Combat Rock as much as any Clash I own, the advance badmouth didn't faze me. The orchestral (synthesized?) horns on the lead cut did put me off, but most of this kicks in, stubborn and jolly and elegiac and together. In the aural fact, it isn't pathetic that Joe strums and chants as if there's no yesterday, it's brave. Convincer: ""We Are the Clash.""

These Maureen Tucker fans recorded their entire output six or seven years ago in a New Zealand that considered Split Enz the cat's pyjamas, so no wonder they went for simplicity. Give them credit for some funny moments, like the doc who takes his shot before he gives you yours, but don't expect much in the way or words, because there aren't many. What they care about is droning guitar jams. Allotted a concept notch for knowing they were a groove band. Entire Lyric of Very Nice Farfisa Theme: ""Tally ho, tally ho.""

Too doleful and detached to be as compassionate as he feels he should be, Eef Barzelay turns his best impulses into slow tunes with homely words that express concern without quite holding together or committing him to anything.

If I told you that the two other great songs here are called ""Many Rivers to Cross"" and ""Viet Nam,"" would you agree that naming this album after its ""hit"" amounts to false advertising?

Conceptually, featured vocalist Vanessa Williams and Pedro Bell's Neegrow cover are the only coups. Lyrically you'll have to settle for pidgin pygmy here, title credo there, some fast-food jokes, and the cautionary ""Cool Joe."" Groovewise it's Clonesville. In short, George's flattest in a decade.

The best-of has always been a dubious consumer service: even when it's a genuine bargain, it allows bizzers to make money off the same music twice, and don't think they don't love every dollar of it. In this case one of the bizzers is the artiste, who already stuck two of these cuts onto that strange half-live, half-compilation ""mini-album"" earlier this year. There's not much arguing with the individual selections. Since it reshuffles the entire first side of You Shouldn't-Nuf Bit Fish, the most playable Clinton of the '80s if not all time, it's stronger cut for cut than that one, and it's a better dance record than Atomic Dog. But it's totally lacking in epistemological integrity, and if you think that's a ridiculous thing to say about a funk album, you've got placebo syndrome--George knows what I'm talking about, and without a dictionary.

Listening to their long-gone live double is like sitting midway back in the Garden because the fun is atmospheric: familiar epiphanies rise up out of the smoke, leaving the roof intact. This budget-priced one-sided video soundtrack offers a healthy serving of '70s raunch from about Row H of a hot '80s show--intense bottom, vocals loud and clear. Second side's a compilation, leading from ""Atomic Dog"" to two rereleases that'll make friends for Some of My Best Jokes. For fans, obviously.

Two and a half hours that confound my capacity for quantification. Some of the funk is standard-issue ass-bounce, many of the femme cameos are piss breaks, the slow ones run down; there's too much throwaway, experiment, and crap. But four long tracks are as remarkable as any Clinton of the past two decades: the so-funky-you-can-smell-it ""Something Stank,"" the Jerry Lee/Danny &amp; the Juniors medley ""Whole Lotta Shakin',"" ""I Can Dance"" and its stripper shit-talk, ""Viagra""'s too-fucking-hard speed-metal.

Alone among the great '50s vocal groups, the Coasters didn't sing protosoul--didn't invest pop sentiment with spiritual transport. Instead, Leiber &amp; Stoller crafted teen mini-sagas that exploited the cartoonish edge of Carl Gardner's sharp tenor and Bobby Nunn's (later Dub Jones's) broad bass. Yet performance--which for Leiber &amp; Stoller also signified production--can carry the music when the composition isn't at its familiar peak of idiomatic brilliance. Except for the delectably prefeminist ""Lady Like"" and the macho-busting ""Three Cool Cats,"" the lyrics of this arcana aren't fully worthy of the canon, but ""Wait a Minute"" and ""Gee Golly"" get by on vocal effects alone.

Cockburn is like a smart, nice, but not especially hip/cool English prof--if he caps ""Mama Just Wants to Barrelhouse All Night Long"" with ""Lord of the Starfields,"" just how raunchy is his barrelhouse likely to be? I'll take smart and nice over hip/cool anytime, and this best-of showcases his conventional wisdom at its most eloquent--you'll never catch the Devil taunting John Denver with an ecstatic ""Why don't we celebrate?""

An impressive document, but the same overkill (eleven musicians plus nine backup singers) that was so exhilarating live wears a little thick over a double-LP, especially when you compare the four repeats from Cocker's two studio albums--he sings more accurately when nobody's rushing him.

Not to be confused with 1969's classic Joe Cocker!, a distinction that gets at the difference quite nicely. It's said that Cocker's voice is gone, and I suppose that's true--it was never much less rough, but it was richer and more flexible. And the live ""Do Right Woman"" on side two is an overstated embarrassment. But the music on side one, with Chris Stainton providing the same old propulsion on piano as well as--hmm--collaborating with this supposed interpreter-only on some good-to-terrific songs, is as rollicking as ever, and the rest of side two is OK. The magic is gone, that's for sure, but maybe it's gone from us, not from him.

It's strange to encounter Cohen in the company of a large group--when he leads a thirteen minute singalong based on a blind man's placard he risks turning into the Pete Seeger of romantic existentialism. And I could do without the shaky guitar improv and the revival of ""Passing Thru,"" though both are tolerable. But it so happens that all five of the self-covers on this album are from Songs From a Room, which I've always thought could use redoing. And eventually the singalong becomes a yellalong, which is much better.

With a new crop of beautiful losers arising out of the latest bohemia as inexorably as ailanthus out of a vacant lot, the man who wrote the book is worth attending, because he's not bitter. After all, righteous anger has never been his long suit, and what does he have to be bitter about? At fifty, he's still living comfortably off the fruits of his spiritual torment. Of course, not every loser is so talented, or resilient, The hymn ""If It Be Your Will"" and the fable ""The Captain"" are as rich and twisted as anything in his career, and ""The Law"" does justice to his patented romantic irony, which by now has a soothing glow. If you're sick of hearing him whisper in your ear that to be a roue is a religious calling, so be it--me, I think this is a better advertisement for middle-aged sex than Dynasty.

Exercise lubricated his voice for a while, but it's dried out again. And when you're croaking the way Cohen is croaking--pun actively regretted, Cohen if anyone has earned the right to call his impending death by however dignified a name he deems appropriate--it takes more than a corps of angels and a Quebecquois Madonna collaborator to turn your verse into song. I admire and when I concentrate enjoy most of these tracks, in particular the spiritually advanced ""You Got Me Singing,"" the fondly remembered ""My Oh My,"" and the consciously complicit ""Almost Like the Blues."" But the only one I love is ""Slow,"" which is not about how considerately he makes love if that's what he's making these days. It's about how unhurriedly he approaches the death that impends for us all.

Smart about abortion's complexities and MLK's infidelities and weed's propensities, so aware of how ""mornin'"" spawns ""moanin'"" and ""wet shit"" swallows ""next shit"" that the sex rhymes hit a nerve, toned up by Drake and Jay-Z's 16s not to mention Trey Songz's and Missy Elliott's hooks, he's worth the shot Jay couldn't resist giving him.

FALSE,B+,Born Sinner,J Cole,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16023,"
You can see why this diligent St. John's magna tops off his make-or-break with the apologetic ""Let Nas Down""--the totemic rapper he betrayed, apparently, by tacking the harmless banger ""Work Out"" onto Cole World, as if Nas rechristening himself Escobar wasn't five times as cheap. Conceptually, this album is an Illmatic move. Musically it's fancied up as it must be from the spare skills of his three mixtapes. But like Illmatic it eschews pop emoluments, and conceptually it's just as canny. Craving street cred while rejecting crime as a hustle or a metaphor, the young man who ""couldn't sell crack but I rap good"" plays the mack daddy. But just as the younger Nas is fascinated by the pitfalls of a corner-boy lifestyle he's not quite part of, this ambitious youngblood is a chronically repentant horndog. Most of his sex songs are also apologies--to a wife or girlfriend, to the women he discards, to other women wronged by other dogs, he varies the theme with winning empathy. But I still prefer him class-conscious: spitting ""I hate richniggaz goddammit/'Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit"" and ending all but one of ""Mo Money""'s 24 quick lines with the M-word. On ""Crooked Smile,"" he combines the two themes hauntingly and elusively--helped big time by the historically pop women of TLC.

A Glaswegian whose romanticism mixes the mundane and the pretentious in nice lyrical proportions, Cole is like a middle-class Roddy Frame escaped to university instead of the bohemian fringe. Born just before the Beatles made it respectable for college kids to like beat music, he claims student life as the rock and roll subject it so obviously is, and I say about time. So what if he can't stop talking about books and movies and gathers his material on day trips from his walkup flat? Does that make him so different from you?

Released 1969 and 1972, Ornette's lost Impulse albums were recorded live at Berkeley May 1968 and NYU March 1969. Dewey Redman's tenor sax roughs up the alto/trumpet/violin-wielding leader, Charlie Haden bows darkly more than he plucks staunchly, and the drummer is 12-year-old Denardo, rumbling irrepressibly all over nine titles that are sometimes also tunes--""New York"" and ""Broken Shadows"" cross-referential, ""Song for Ch�"" a dirge to remember. It sounds good because what Ornette doesn't? But you hardly notice Don Cherry returning on the second album, and while you can hear what a magnificent player Denardo will become, he's here partly because he isn't yet--Ornette wanted a bottom more untethered than the mere magnificence a grooving Ed Blackwell would soon provide on 1970's Friends and Neighbors. The late '60s were politically turbulent times, and good for Ornette for trying to tell the truth about them. But in the end, that wasn't the kind of truth that set him free.

Fortunately, the next next goes for the bare live bones, with the classic ""Frosty"" establishing a bite and authority that are never relinquished. I miss that down-home wit, though--giving your bass player room for a hornpipe is the kind of dumb joke that's afflicted live albums for years.

Me, I think ""Dance Critters"" is a mean antiboogie and ""A Different Bob"" a different cheatin' song, and direct your attention to ""Considering a Move to Memphis,"" where Colorblind expects to bowl, speak in tongues, visit Graceland, eat piroshkis, and (most important) get to know Gus Cannon.

Half of this belated testament was recorded CBGB 1978, a final track Hurrah 1980. But I'd never heard of them, and when I checked with New York Rocker's Andy Schwartz, he remembered only the name. On the evidence of these 16 homages to first-growth Talking Heads, from long before it was determined that the world moved on a woman's hips, we were missing something: the halting yet propulsive, arty yet catchy ejaculations of the uptight nerd as subversive geek. A five-year-old sex fiend joins suburban tennis players exposing their underthings join two straight songs about kitchens join the incendiary ""Old People"": ""Get out in the streets/Turn over cars/Elbow young people/Set garbage on fire.""

Common raps about black life as most black people live it and black manhood as most young black men grow into it, and while his flow isn't primed for the dance floor, it's complex and full-bodied in a way few, you know, white artists could imitate, much less make up.

Protest songs are hard to nail even in the moment, and I can't promise that the three bull's-eyes here will sound as dead on in five years, or one. Cooder's innovation is reapplying the Popular Front mindset to the messy compromises of electoral politics, and all the must-hears illuminate the 2012 presidential election rather than merely referencing it: ""Mutt Romney Blues,"" where the Republican standard bearer does to his dog precisely what he'll do to us; ""Cold Cold Feeling,"" where a black man in the White House details his blues; and especially ""The 90 and the 9,"" where the singer explains why he's repurposing that gospel song about this may be the last time. ""Going to Tampa"" slaps on too broad a burlesque, ""Guantanamo"" wanders off message, and others just don't twist the screw tight enough. But I give him extra credit for both preaching to the converted and doing his damnedest to rally the holier-than-thou.

They're hardly the first art band with a great rhythm section, but just like Pylon and the B-52's, they're fronted by a singer you remember--the slightly demented David Hanson, who does a beefcake variation on Fred Schneider's sharply campy attack. The four songs on their candid bid for wealth, fame, drugs, and wealth sort themselves out nicely. But except on a title number in which Hanson envies Sammy Davis Jr., Leroy Nieman, and Colonel Tom Parker--in which he longs to ""live like Elvis""--they do slide back to their primordial white funk bottom when you leave them alone.

Larry Coryell is the greatest thing to happen to the guitar since stretched gut. The permanent evidence of this has been sparse, however--a bad record with the Free Spirits, timid ones with Gary Burton, a somewhat over-avant performance on the Jazz Composer's Orchestra set, and an inspired chorus here or there with jazz-rock leaders like Steve Marcus and Don Sebeskey. This is far more satisfying but still crabbed and uneven. It includes some wonderfully funny wah-wah work alongside apparent homages to Wes Montgomery, near-parody singing alongside a couple of tracks (one composed by Coryell and featuring Elvin Jones, one composed by Junior Walker) that approach the soaring pyrotechnics Coryell can produce when he is good live. Recommended.

Coryell has been the jazz rock hope since founding the Free Spirits four years ago, so it's worth noting that his best record to date sounds mostly unimprovised. The title of ""Elementary Guitar Solo #5"" describes it perfectly--an unsurprising, fairly deliberate progression of notes over the solid bottom of studio soul aces Chuck Rainey and Bernard Purdie, with Coryell's color, authority, and dynamics providing most of the ""jazz."" It's also worth noting that the most exciting track on the album does sound improvised--""The Jam with Albert"" (bassist Stinson). And that he's not singing a whole lot. And that he's still singing too much.

Between the first and last words of this working-trio album--""Welcome to the death of rock and roll"" and ""Bliss is all-eternal""--Coryell manages to play a lot of guitar, much of which (unlike the singing) sounds like rock and roll: themes over a steady beat. Even as an improvisor he's more into modal flights and electronic extravaganzas than inventing melodies off the changes. So ignore the rhetoric and face the music.

Yet odd as it may seem, I find that he suffers from Jackson Browne's syndrome--that is, he's a little boring.

Without the sustained melodicism of Imperial Bedroom (first side, anyway) to impart the illusion of meaningful wholeness, this is adjudged a major letdown by Elvis's acolytes. But ""Boxing Day"" is hardly the first time one of his punderous constructions has failed not just to signify but to communicate. Most of this disparate collection (first side, anyway) does what he's always done--convey an elusive feeling that's half pinned down by the words because that's all the grasp he's got on it. And though the alternate versions of ""Shipbuilding"" (Robert Wyatt) and ""Pills and Soap"" (the Imposter) are indeed more gripping, their literalness does place his personal contortions in useful perspective.

Pieced together in 1997 from impulsively conceived, doggedly recorded scraps of DAT and four-track by Austin mastermind Robert Harrison and a Memphis tape wizard who loved how Big Star the band was, Cotton Mather's second album caught the attention of some British Beatles fanatics d/b/a Oasis, who brought them over to open and even generated some U.K. sales. While allowing his vocal resemblance to ""John Lennon with a Southern accent and a head cold,"" Harrison's extensive notes don't cite the Beatles much even though ""My Before and After"" resembles ""Ticket to Ride"" more than its supposed inspiration ""(Reach Out) I'll Be There"" and ""Private Ruth"" echoes ""For No One"" straight up. Harrison is no more a genius than Noel Gallagher, so though the lyrics aren't spaced-out gibberish or obvious pap, they're unequal to the music--which definitely beats, for instance, the last three songs on the first Big Star album, and even more remarkable, kind of makes you appreciate Oasis.

In addition to balancing the instruments, the remixes add a few decorative flourishes, and as a Crenshaw fanatic I've already put them on a special tape. Did I get it free? You bet. What do you take me for--a collector?

FALSE,B+,Life's Too Short,Marshall Crenshaw,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2273,"
By now there's comfort in his surprising little modulations as well as his plain-spoken prosody, and it's nigh on 10 years since he collected so many strong songs; heard live, ""Better Back Off"" and ""Don't Disappear Now"" seem no less inevitable than ""Cynical Girl"" or ""Whenever You're on My Mind."" But even if he finally gets his just market share, the new converts won't sing the same praises as the original faithful, because by now his feeling for his craft runs to weary wisdom rather than brimming delight. Marshall's compact solos and Kenny Aronoff's firm beat reinforce his resolve without hinting at his grace.

FALSE,B+,Photographs and Memories,Jim Croce,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6653,"
Death hasn't changed this engaging, rather repetitious minor artist into a genius, but it's reminded us why he was (and is) engaging. His short-haul trucker persona (world-weary machismo with a heart of gold and a soul of beaten copper) and detached lowlife portraiture (he doesn't mess around that much with Jim himself) were a relief from post-hippie confessionalism, and his music was sweet and tough, never an easy combo to bring off. But like so many tough guys, he does get mawkish--only ""Operator"" adds insight as well as terse melody to our romantic mythology--and though his four albums do include a few good songs that didn't make it onto this fourteen-track compilation, they're enough like those that did that you can live without them.

An excellent joke in which a man out of tunes, utilizing croaking vocals and some well-placed banjo, transforms Kristofferson, Springsteen, Prince, and even Neil Diamond (""Solitary Man,"" Johnny Cash named an album after it) into alt-country all-depressives. And when he does the same for Queen-Bowie, the dolor is too funny to laugh off.

The cutting nasality of Crow's vocals is revivalism at its finest--he's not an original like Ray Benson, but he's got the style down. And as a swinging eclectic he borrows anything he likes, from the Cleftones to a dope-running epic to ""Turkey, Texas (Home of Bob Wills)."" Stop off in Turkey first. But if you like it there, put this on your Christmas list right after Asleep at the Wheel.

I used to assume they were just a good little band who'd latched onto a great little song, but while their new white-funk rhythms are superfluous and none of the tunes is ""My Boyfrield,"" I'm beginning to think they could go national.

Rick Rubin meets the doom fops of the former Southern Death Cult and concocts the metal dreams are made of--Zep for our time, supposedly. One reason it's a great joke is that in 2087 almost nobody will be able to tell it from the real thing. The other reason it's a great joke is that right now almost anybody can. Direct comparison reveals that Jimmy Page's thunderclap riffs, Robert Plant's banshee yowls, and John Bonham's ka-boom ka-boom are just as hard to replicate as you thought they were. I hear Steppenwolf (an unconvincing ""Born to Be Wild""), Cream (""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" as ""Aphrodisiac Jacket""), and Aerosmith--fop but no fool, Ian Astbury apes Steve Tyler rather than the unapproachable Plant. I also hear lots of Zep simplified--no sagas, no tempo shifts, no blues. Inspirational Verse: ""Zany antics of a beat generation/In their wild search for kicks.""

""Crack in New York,"" about Manley's war on ganja, almost gloats. Inspirational Cackle: ""Even professionals get spoiled by it too (hah!).""

Boy George really doesn't sound like Smokey Robinson, you know--not the way Frankie Miller sounds like Otis Redding, not even the way John Cougar sounds like Bruce Springsteen. If he did, he could probably put this tuneful collection all the way over--Smokey's spiritual gravity has redeemed some pretty lightweight lyrics, so this sensual specificity might just salvage some vague ones. As it is, George's warm, well-meaning, slightly clumsy croon signifies most effectively when it has the least to say--when it's most purely a medium for his warm, well-meaning, slightly clumsy self. Just like Helen Terry, who packs the voice of Merry Clayton into the body of Gertrude Stein, his real aim in life is to reenact the story of the ugly duckling--and to radiate the kind of extreme tolerance that's so often engendered by extreme sexual ambiguity.

Stephen Holden thinks kids liked Boy George's singing more than I did because he evoked not a soul man but a synthesizer. Right: a synthesizer who wants to be your friend. His music is too nice to withstand much critical scrutiny, which means he's best when he puts a vaguely dishy edge on his female-identified pansexual humanitarianism: ""Karma Chameleon,"" ""Church of the Poison Mind,"" ""Black Money."" And the topper is ""The War Song,"" which contributed more conspicuously to his U.S. downfall than mere heroin abuse. ""War is stupid/And people are stupid""--now is that nice?

The DIY/XXX rapper's 2017 breakthrough album starts with some street sociology and an earned brag before returning to the ""fuckin'-for-a-check"" rhymes that remain the bliss point of an irrepressible rhymer who never slurs a phrase or swallows a word. But the clincher is ""Biggie Smalls,"" one of several tracks that prove her heart is as big as the rest of her: not just ""Stretch marks in a bikini, I'm that damn brave"" but ""fuck dude if he don't like small boobs,"" because ""Big or small, it's who you are."" After which, right, it's back to ""Pay the damn price or go home to your wife."" But that's who she is whether or not it's who she'll remain.

The sound is dry postpunk, with touches of Wire's spare, arty melodicism, more Pink Flag than 154. Never pretty, it's treated with a properly mnemonic pop overlay--scan the titles and you'll recall a phrase from all but a few of these thirteen songs. Intelligent phrases they are, too. Yet what are we to think of a band whose best song is based on Albert Camus's The Stranger, a book that was holy writ for collegiate existentialists before Robert Smith was even born? The last thing we need is collegiate existentialism nostalgia.

Caught in his least lugubrious moments, Robert Smith stands revealed as a guy who gets a lot of skin because he believes he can live without it. He just won't play the ""stupid game"" that hooks the definitive ""Let's Go to Bed,"" with its rotating I-don't-if-you-don't challenges--care, feel, want it, say it, and of course play it (and now let's go to bed, it's getting late). Guys who don't make passes because they wear glasses hate him for this, as do guys who don't get laid despite their muscular bods and heads. Above the fray, I think he's kind of amusing myself--a real cool type.

Considering how cheap they are to produce, jazz combo records like this one are shamefully rare, and even when they're tightly conceived and not excessively earthbound (not just Grover Washington but Joe Henderson) or ethereal (not just Mahavishnu but Kenny Wheeler) it's rare yet that they're as melodic, economical, and fraught with small pleasures as this one.

FALSE,B+,Blues at Montreux,King Curtis and Champion Jack Dupree,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6667,"
Because great stylists aren't always great improvisers, and because great accompanists are only occasionally great leaders, even the music Curtis intended for LP release was marred by a certain marginal-differentiation monotony (his posthumous concert albums are even worse). And though Dupree, as one of Europe's resident Real Blues Singers, makes it into all kinds of collectors' series, his recent recordings have been forgettable. This LP cancels out the dross--just when Dupree's call gets redundant, Curtis responds with his saxophone. Like most live dates it lacks compression, and Dupree is old enough for his voice to be changing again, but this is a pleasant surprise.

FALSE,B+,Cymande,Cymande,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6668,"
What they call Nyah-rock is African with Jamaican influences--not straight reggae so much as Rastafarian by which I mean that a lot of the songs seem designed to give off a tribal aura. The groove is slow but very seductive, and while the improvisations aren't exciting as such, they're very satisfying rhythmically. The borrowed folk chants are exciting as such.

Long on hooks and cameos, the Wild Bunch DJ's mix tape connects by the crude expedient of not proving how obscure his crates are.

Dama is a classic folkie, a cosmopolitan leftist credited with inventing Malagasy nueva cancion, an elected legislator as renowned in Madagascar as Victor Jara was in Chile. D'Gary is a classic find, a prodigy-prot������������������g������������������ from cattle country where the main road is an 11-hour walk away. Though their rainbow rhythms are formally unique and patently pleasurable, not even producer Henry Kaiser claims to apprehend them fully. The hook is D'Gary's distinctively Malagasy way with his recently acquired guitar, and even more, since that wasn't enough to put his solo album over, Dama's calm, good-humored, deeply assured vocal presence--a politician's gift from a place and time where oratory is still entertainment.

Danny is Green on Red's Dan Stuart, a likable fool, Dusty the Dream Syndicate's Steve Wynn, a pretentious wise guy, and with the help of some L.A. drinking buddies they've come up with an album less ambitious and more satisfying than any either band has produced on its own. It makes a concept of the loser mythology that's such a big deal in L.A., and I was prepared to hate it--I've never believed that ""we've all gotta go down."" But the songs are relaxed, unassuming, and funny. I guess if the Heartbreakers could make heroin addiction sound like a good time, these guys have a right to do the same for alcoholism--they certainly have tradition behind them.

Though the 59-year-old jazzman sired Nas and references the ""embryonic state of the hip hop,"" for him that was ""young children's music."" And please, he's no ""griot."" Dara mines a more class- and nation-specific cultural mode: Afrocentric local color in the manner of PBS and Black History Month (release date: February 20). But where 1998's In the World proceeded directly to limbo on the rough-hewn cobblestones of its noble intentions, here he gets somewhere. More direct rhythmically, more considerate melodically, discerningly observed and recalled until it gets all poetic on our ass, this is at least as educational as Maya Angelou, and much more fun. One thing, though. Dara's warm trumpet tone is compared to Roy Eldridge's. You think maybe he could learn to sing with Little Jazz's nonchalant authority? We wish.

He can sing sweet or gritty, write sweet, gritty, or pretentious. His rhythms and arrangements show a sense of roots and a sense of style. He's got black consciousness and pop ambition.

Second generation hip comedy. The third time I listened to this record, the first side destroyed the two comedy albums I'd just heard--it includes the best ever Woodstock, Cheech &amp; Chong &amp; FM radio bits. It's very subtle, though, no yock-yocks. Potential.

In which the first man to record ""Green Green Grass of Home"" and ""Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp"" makes something of the literate modern-country approach typified by Mickey Newbury. Among his finds: two songs by Nico's favorite Orange County poet, Jackson Browne, and ""Willing,"" which keeps on trucking. Unfortunately, Darrell sounds too sensitive to project the kind of dumb authority that puts corny puns like ""Bed of Roses"" across, and the two songs from coproducer Larry Murray are irredeemable. But old folkie away from home Dick Rosmini is Murray's better half, and Clarence White picks real good.

But it'll sure stick to your ribs longer than what Jon Spencer stewed up with R.L.

FALSE,B+,On the Corner,Miles Davis,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6681,"
Because the tracks are very short, because Miles plays more organ than trumpet and not much of that, and because the improvisations are rhythmic rather than melodic--often on a theme from ""It's Your Thing"" that I'm not swearing the Isleys (much less Davis) invented--most jazzbos have thrown up their hands at this one. Well, poo on jazzbos. But that's no reason for rockbos to sing hosanna to the highest--rhythmic improvisations are hardly the equivalent of a big beat and don't guarantee a good one.

Double whammy. Not only isn't this new Miles, as people were quick to figure out despite the pseudo-streetwise On the Corner-style cover, but it isn't quite vintage Miles, either. Recorded in the late '60s, these were outtakes, and one of them--""Dual Mr. Tillman Anthony,"" a thirteen-minute piano ostinato showcase without even the justification of a heavy funk beat--should definitely have remained one. The rest is better, but I thank CBS's marketing whizzes for sending me back to Davis's great work with the same group--like Sorcerer and Nefertiti, both still in catalogue.

Miles tastes better out of the can than fresh watermelon or even V.S.O.P., but these tapes, mostly from when he was working out his '70s concept a decade or so ago, are damaged goods. Oddity: David Crosby's ""Guinnevere,"" itself based on a three-note motif from Sketches of Spain.

Like so many groove albums, this one is now-you-hear-it now-you-don't. But once you learn to live with the synthesizer colors of Robert Irving III, the only weak link in the band the leader's been forging since his comeback, you stop worrying about why he's making a conventional fusion record and realize that between his own muscle-mouth and John Scofield's sweet-and-sour licks and the quite audible Jones-Foster pulse he's made a pretty damn good conventional fusion record.

Miles's endgame at Columbia was true fusion--improvised jazz-rock, pretty good of its sort, but what a sort. This is more like pop-funk Sketches of Spain, with the starperson's trumpet glancing smartly off an up-to-date panoply of catchy little tunes, beats, and rhythm effects. I cried fraud at first, and if you have no use for catchy little anythings you'll agree, but I changed my mind. Marcus Miller acquits himself in the Gil Evans role, George Duke gets off a nice lick, and Scritti Politti provides a snappier cover than Cyndi Lauper. Minor, and his best in a decade.

Fewer than half of the 42 tracks are previously unreleased--dark magus Teo Macero broke up and relocated most of the others onto Live-Evil, Big Fun, Get Up With It, the obscure late catchall Directions, and, yes, A Tribute to Jack Johnson, the landmark album that climaxes this five-disc collector's indulgence. Outfitted with the usual pricey packaging and elaborate notes, it's ""complete"" only if the four missing ""Duran""s, 15 missing ""Nem Um Talvaez""s, etc., were false starts. But it's a mother of a motherlode. I'm glad Macero imposed his sense of form on Miles's '70s experiments, and definitely don't need the Bitches Brew box. But though the ""Go Ahead John"" Macero pieced together for Big Fun gets the good bits, I'd rather listen to the raw material that takes up 45 minutes of disc two. Though the multiple Hermeto Pascoal takes add up to a quiet disc four, they're as soothing as they wanna be. With major input from John McLaughlin and the bass tandem of Dave Holland and Michael Henderson, these jams were why electric jazz was once a thrilling idea--and still is sometimes.

Too bad Dawson's DIY imprint is above the Deluxe Edition hustle, because tracks 13 to 16 are ""bonus"" yuck at its most useless. Yuckiest of all is the insipid anarcho-pastoral finale ""Utopian Futures,"" which dreams an ideal world that would in fact lack--among many things I enjoy, such as non-DIY CDs--the library system she celebrates so heartily right before the album's true climax, the inspirational memoir of vanquished dysfunction ""Walk Like Thunder."" Oh well. She's 37 now, married and a mom, and like most aging hippies can be a crank or a lump--in her case, usually the former. So be glad her gift for whimsy and/or confessional lifts most of what we'll call the ""real"" album. Highlights include the pregnancy report ""All I Could Do,"" the literary reflection ""Miami Advice,"" and an ecumenically non-utopian protest song called ""Same Shit/Complicated""--to which I will merely add that Madison, Wisconsin isn't the only place with some nice cops.

To my surprise, this Chuck Berry look-alike and birds-and-bees sound-alike qualifies as another minor LA r&amp;b novelty auteur. His original ""Little Bitty Pretty One"" may not cut Thurston Harris's, but his original ""Over and Over"" deserves to outlast Dave Clark's and when he got desperate for a lyrical hook sometimes he came up with a ""Teenage Philosopher"" or a ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rock and Roll.""

A man of simple tastes, I'm thrown into a tizzy when I find myself uninterested in playing an album comprising twelve tunes I can hum after a dozen plays. I think it's because they're so prepossessing they short-circuit my simple aesthetic sense. I was thrown off for weeks, to take one example, by the soul horns that open the lead cut. They sounded fussy. Soul horns. On a pop record. Overreaching.

Just like Howard Stern says, it's tough being funny every time out, but at least they're in there pitching, hurling sophomoric knuckleballs at every freshman in sight. Though they've picked up some sarcasm at the feet of Camper Van, pop gothic remains their thing, from the '60s to Graceland to exploitation flicks to Anglodisco ""art fags,"" an epithet I'm sure Mark Knopfler will find hilarious.

For a while there I thought they'd scored a comedy album worthy of their IQs--its forward motion makes them sound like kids again. But they're such shallow little doofuses that the jokes only stick when they're aimed at the right targets, always a subjective call.

The elemental runs a lot deeper for this Jack White-Dean Fertita vehicle than for their secret sharers Queens of the Stone Age. Just as in the Delta blues they adore, even fewer songs here than on the debut will mean much cut adrift from this particular musical realization. Nevertheless, I heartily recommend ""The Difference Between Us"" to whoever wants it--the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, mayhap?

Whitney Balliett's notes compare her to Bobby Short, high praise from him but anathema if, like me, you think Short's show of class epitomizes what contemporary singing ought to avoid. Fortunately, Dearie has the grace to understate her high technique; she sounds like an emotionally substantial Astrud Gilberto. I can't think of a rock singer who could tiptoe so sure-footedly through these melodies, much less make them up, and if lyrical ploys about ""velvet wine"" are uncomfortably reminiscent of Nancy Sinatra, well, that's what happens when you sing for your supper club.

Having outlived their modishness, the biracial art-rap-cum-ragecore trio release a double album that, as I once requested, sidesteps their sex-hating/fearing misogyny. This they achieve not by putting it aside altogether but by sticking it on one disc, based musically on ""Bj�����������"" har har, epitomized thematically by ""Have a Sad Come BB"" (pronounced ""baby""), and entitled for confusion's sake Niggas on the Moon. Its longer opposite number, entitled for confusion's sake Jenny Death, is epitomized thematically by a breakneck Humvee of an opener called ""Break Mirrors With My Face in the United States."" They couldn't have anticipated Freddie Gray except in the sense that there'll always be another, the rare ragecore truism with undeniable truth value. But in this time of racist callousness, I find their all-purpose hostility and alienation apt and, sometimes, perversely satisfying--on ""Pss Pss,"" ""Centuries of Dawn,"" ""Beyond Alive.""

They came from nowhere with an airy debut that never touched ground or stopped coming, and nowhere is where it went. So this time they go against their own best instincts, bearing down on individual compositions rather than immersing themselves in sound. When they hit one--slow stuff like ""All This Love"" and ""I Like It"" is why the Lord blessed them--you can hear it breaking through and crossing over, always the Motown ideal. When they don't, all you hear is exquisitely cautious product.

Eldra DeBarge's genius isn't especially with-it--uptempo arrangements do nothing for his outstretched melodies and chilly harmonies. But he and his countless siblings scored one hit after another off In a Special Way, which led to a traumatic tour with the unsinkable Luther Vandross when Eldra might have been working up new product. Hence this mishmash--a Richard Perry-produced soundtrack one-off, a Giorgio Moroder-produced soundtrack one-off, a 1981 ballad featuring Eldra and sister Bunny in their classic falsetto mode, four standard medium-fasts from C-list funk-popper Jay Graydon, and two uptempo numbers from Eldra, who seems to be getting a handle on the stuff. Pray the paranoia underlying his all-too-interesting ""The Walls (Come Tumbling Down)"" dissipates when he settles into the studio again.

With his solo debut an old stiff, several lesser siblings convicted cocaine traffickers, and Uncle Berry passed on to his corporate reward, this is black pop on a beeline for the cutout bins, which I guess means it isn't really black pop at all. Just good black music, ancient to the future, all jumping rhythms and space-case melody, less catchy song than gorgeous sound. Can't say maturity's done him a damn bit of good.

But from Ellington copyright to Okinawan golden oldie, other descriptives also pertain--open, surprising, catchy.

Well after soukous supposedly withered away, a second-tier crowd-pleaser with a willingness to throw his big body into a dance he named puts out his 17th or 18th album, something like that. Vocally he's no Wemba or Rochereau, but Manda Chante (of Wenge Musica, how did you miss him?) caramelizes one track, and Le Jeune Makuta, Likanga Mangenza, and others I've never heard of take guest turns. Vocal colors shift as leads come and go; the chorus expands and contracts. Rhythms converge, thin out, flow horizonward. A saxophone comes in to garnish the guitars. Songs segue for easier dancing, or divide into parts the dancers better be ready for. The jollity is general, audible. A generic good time is had by all.

At twenty-eight, Joseph Bowie comes on as spoiled and stunted as the most solipsistic hardcore teen, so it says worlds for the power of his rhythm section and the imagination of his guitarists that he can't ruin his own music. More Ornette than Contortions this time, he even shows off his good breeding by funkifying a Charlie Parker tune. On the other hand, his ""For the Love of Money"" sounds like slumming, especially from a guy who couldn't outsing Kenny Gamble in the shower.

Because this date by the former Miles Davis drummer features the protean Lester Bowie in a relatively muted frame of mind, comparisons are made to In a Silent Way. But guitarist John Abercrombie is more like an anti-intellectual Bill Evans (bassist Eddie Gomez's mentor, by the way) than like John McLaughlin. And DeJohnette's heads don't match Davis's and Zawinul's on Silent Way any more than DeJohnette himself matches Tony Williams. For all that, a lot warmer than most of what this label seems to think is jazz, especially on side two.

Now that Eric and George have given their imprimature, D&amp;B's first release, on Elektra, is beginning to sell as it should. This one was recorded much earlier, with Duck Dunn and Jack Nix producing instead of Leon Russell, but released much later. Perhaps if I heard it first I'd like it more--or rather, even more, since I already like it--but I don't think it compares to the Elektra album (rated A plus in an earlier CG). The warmth that suffuses their music is obscured more than once by some perfunctory soul-shouting, and the arrangements are less than inventive. Nice enough, though.

After almost four years, Posdnuos and company emerge from the ether like the long-lost friends they are. Their wordplay assured in its subtle smarts, their delivery unassuming in its quick, unmacho mumble, their cultural awareness never smug about its balance, they bind up an identifiable feeling in an identifiable sound, and just about every one of the 17 tracks comes equipped with a solid beat and a likable hook or chorus.

Because it leads with the miraculous ""Let the Mystery Be""--an agnostic's declaration of faith so homespun it makes the word agnostic seem absurdly hoity-toity and severe, so unfaltering it modestly conceals the tremendous intellectual effort her decision not to know self-evidently required--this Kansas City 31-year-old's debut has authenticity hounds in a lather. But she never gets so near perfection again--the catchy ""Our Town"" seems contrived by comparison, the signature ""Infamous Angel"" obscure. Also, she worries more about her sins than an agnostic should. It's hard to believe she's ever done anything that bad.

Their second half-assed compilation in a year and a half finally gets it half right, putting a single sleeve around their most tuneful technotopia and death-fluff. Granted, it omits their only actual U.S. hit, ""People Are People,"" already reprised to bait the dire Some Great Reward, baiting instead with the previously un-American Everything Counts EP, which holds up indifferently in such select company, though the squishy ""Fly on the Windscreen"" bookends the blasphemous ""Blasphemous Rumors"" neatly enough. But the collection has a structure, proceeding chronologically from young technotopian romance to slightly older technodystopian despair. First they ""Just Can't Get Enough,"" then they ponder ""The Meaning of Love,"" then they doubt ""Love in Itself,"" then they play ""Master and Servant."" The little girls understand.

When Vince Clarke departed Yazward in 1982, Fashion-in-a-Hurry's commercial doom was presumed sealed, whereupon Martin Gore went ahead and proved how easy it is to write ditties once you're in a position to exploit them. It's not as if anybody can, but at this point in pop's progress potential supply far exceeds potential demand. Yet only rarely is the production process altogether mechanical. Gore can't create without venting his shallow morbidity, which happens to mesh with a historically inevitable strain of adolescent angst, and he takes himself seriously enough to have burdened albums with concept and such. This time, however, the title announces his determination to give it up to his even shallower singer, David Gahan, who likes Gore's message because it's a good way to impress girls. Dark themes combine with light tunes until the very end of side two. Anybody with an interest in adolescent angst (adolescents included) can sob or giggle along as the case may be.

Migrating to Ghana from Dahomey in 1955 to become a highlife star in the '60s, the trumpeter's selling point was his Francophone roots, which gave him a leg up on those newfangled Congolese rhythms. He wasn't above the occasional twist or cha-cha either. Initially these 19 cuts sound pleasingly familiar but not all that distinctive, on the cusp between the generic-elemental and the generic-cliched.

With Daniel Bejar's latest band sound already compared to everything from Aja and Avalon to late New Order, I'll take, um--Pet Shop Boys! Forgoing the rock expressionism he lacks the heart or chops for, Bejar bends Neil Tennant's bemused calm toward an acerbic subtlety suitable for deflecting one's historical anomie. Mix in a smoove groove suitable for deflecting others' disinterest in one's historical anomie and you have intelligent lounge music for 21st-century depressives. The X factor is trumpeter JP Carter, who no one will mistake for Chuck Mangione because he's there not for jazz cred but to stick it to the guitars Bejar lacks the heart and chops to stand up against.

The Emeralds are stay-at-home Spinners, and Abrim Tilmon, who writes (and helps sing) their material and is credited with coarranging an album that lists no producer or personnel, is Thom Bell without an instinct for the killer hook.

If this isn't Kiss for college kids, then it's Meat Loaf for college kids who are too sophisticated to like Meat Loaf. Aside from music per se, the Kiss connection is in their cartoonishness--Devo's robot moves create distance, a margin of safety, the way Kiss's makeup does. But the Meat Loaf connection is deeper, because this is real midnight-movie stuff--the antihumanist sci-fi silliness, the reveling in decay, the thrill of being in a cult that could attract millions and still seem like a cult, since 200 million others will never even get curious. (It's no surprise to be told that a lot of their ideas come from Eraserhead, but who wants to go see Eraserhead to make sure?) What makes this group worthy of attention at all--and now we're back with Kiss, though at a more complex level--is the catchy, comical, herky-jerky rock and roll they've devised out of the same old basic materials. In small doses it's as good as novelty music ever gets, and there isn't a really bad cut on this album. But it leads nowhere.

In a nation where preserving musical treasure has been a point of socialist pride, her adept, folky elaborations avoid the appearance of self-consciousness--the closely related guitar figures underlying these songs are graceful, welcome, inevitable.

And while I've loved the Gladiolas' goofy original of ""Little Darlin'"" ever since Alan Freed refused to play the Diamonds' in 1957, I have to admit that theirs is the classic. Attacking every target with a petty criminal's nervous intensity, they went all out on pure novelties--not only ""Little Darlin',"" but ""Daddy Cool"" and ""She Say (Oom Dooby Doom)""--and their frantic notion of fun says worlds about how rock and roll first hit the straightest white teenagers.

Hate to say this, but what makes Dibango's African dances so much catchier than those of the competition is that he's from a French part of the continent, which means he relates to the Caribbean--all of it--rather than to rock.

Since both records are more abstract than their cheering sections understand, the many voices Rock enlists make a difference. From Doom and Black Thought down to Phat Kat and Frank Nitty, they ground Dilla's beats where, for instance, the finished singles collected on Rapster's Dillanthology comp put them in the background where any pro knows they belong.

A meaningful title. Fifteen years ago, sweet-and-dirty New Orleans jive conveyed the same wry rebelliousness that Dr. John's night-tripping hoodoo did ten years later. These days he's purveying fifteen-year-old New Orleans jive himself, last time with his own band and classic songs, this time with a classic band--the Meters--and his own songs. Last time worked better, but producer Allen Toussaint, whose ""Life"" sounds terrific b/w Dr. John's own rakish ""Such a Night,"" gets this one over.

Dr. John does enunciate more piquantly than Frankie Miller or King Biscuit Boy, but this is basically another chance for Allen Toussaint to meet up with a white blues singer and groove all the way to the bank. Not that that's bad--these days it's my favorite subgenre, and this may be the best of them all. Despite the absence of a standout song (""Mos' Scocious"" is a great readymade) it's more fun than Right Place, Wrong Time. But it does lean toward the music-is-the-answer fallacy. Toussaint shouldn't write songs putting down those who fill their lives ""with money matters""--he's too wealthy. And Dr. John shouldn't sing them--he's too hip.

What a great gift idea--Stardust for r&amp;b weirdos who find Willie Nelson prosaic. Anything but straight, the ivory-tickling second-liner raids the pop songbook for hipper material than the richer outlaw, and has such a great time with Rickie Lee Jones you're sorry she has to leave--especially since his vocal poetry does wander on its own.

Wondering why these six slices of slide-guitar Americana cut through with such uncommon truth power, I learned that Jay Ward is a lifelong stutterer who escapes his prison not just by singing but by singing about his prison. Standin' at the edge of a dream gettin' ready to jump, nothing special in itself. Turnin' at the fork in the road, ditto. But ""I've got some tales on the tip of my tongue / Gettin' ready to speak""?

More or less totally destructive. The one-sided concept is hypochondria--what's the last soul album to use the word ""hyperventilation""? Side two leads off with the singer catching his wife in bed with another woman. By the way, I've finally figured out what his voice sounds like--an Afro-American air raid siren.

Worth finding for his liner notes alone (""Why does jury duty pay more than my job and why is it the only Joy I know is a dishwashing detergent?""), an unvanquished professional and hopeless eccentric goes sane. His voice won't fend off nuclear attack anymore, but from Shirley &amp; Lee to the Bellamy Brothers, from black history to rap, his vision of soul remains unique, and also remains a vision of soul.

Not so easy to describe this Seattle duo, so just say dance-pop performance art that dares Justin Timberlake to take SNL into the studio with him. The very silly third track ""Murderburger--Official Motion Picture Trailer"" suggests that their true calling is sketch comedy, but then the ""Laos! Laos! Laos!

One reason this band epitomizes corporate rock is that it has its meager merits, and I'm ashamed to say that on this compilation I enjoy them. In fact, the bassline hooks of ""China Grove"" and ""Long Train Runnin'"" move me so efficiently that by the time we get to ""Listen to the Music""--which with its easy-rolling rhythms, anonymous harmonies, countrified arrangement, meticulous production, and smug message made my ten-worst list in 1972--I'm still listening to the music.

KMD's reincarnated Zev Love X says his new handle starts with an abbreviation for Metal Face and is based on a Marvel villain who wants to rule the world for its own good. As concept, this could get tedious fast, but as a few skits it's one more scenic sonic on an album that reaches its high point when it samples not just the Scooby-Doo theme but Scoob himself, thus acknowledging that, as Scoob knows so well, some villains are just plain evil. Right, the album never comes into full focus. But it does flow, as music and as signifying. Message: this smart guy had some horrible setbacks and came out on the other side. A role model, you might say.

Doughty has never been tuneless. But he's better at lyrics than melody and better at declaiming than singing, which is one reason he foundered after he broke with the polyrhythmic Soul Coughing. It also explains why his old songs held up when he devised an alternatively polyrhythmic hipster hip-hop that he elaborated further for these new ones, breaking decisively with the trad band sound he settled for solo--backup more percussive and electronic, guests more rappers than singers. For the middle third of a 16-track album that lasts just 50 minutes, the lyrics have trouble filling in their title concepts. But everywhere he sounds at home. He's acerbic of course--he hasn't gone soft. But he's always credible, often thoughtful, and sometimes even spiritual.

Neither thug nor thug wannabe, he's plenty talented, but pretty shallow and without much focus as a mack. That's why his very first official album, pleasing and hookful though it be, consistently bemoans the confusing emoluments and accoutrements of fame. Given his limitations, his famous friends are a mixed benefit, because they show him up. Weezy schools him with wheezy jokes from jail. Nicki Minaj's nasty mouth comes as a turn-on. And Jay-Z's 16 takes up the self-doubt theme not to explore that narrow seam of his expanded consciousness but to show the young man how it's done: ""And since no good deed go unpunished/I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was/I once was cool as the Fonz was/But these bright lights turned me to a monster.""

But Steve Wynn's take on the usual world-weary table topics is gratifying matter-of-fact and no more, and music like this--music where the fun is in the no-fun--feels incomplete when it stops there.

A consistently listenable document of a documentably titanic live band. The only hedge is that it's front-loaded with most of the same songs that lead the band's greatest album, not that I ever mind hearing them again. Second half is a generous assortment that revs up the signature ""Puttin' People on the Moon"" with roughed-up Hood and Cooley solos, improves on the Cooley highlight from their weakest album, and updates Hood's deathless set piece ""18 Wheels of Love"" to bring the miracle into the present time--and also, you'll hope, the future.

These swampy genre pieces, spawned in the backwaters of the English pub scene and drawled with hush-moufed abandon by Sean Tyla (spelling phonetic?), are tuneful, affectionate, raunchy, and sometimes inspired--a lick here, a yell there, a concept somewhere else. but it's a lot harder for an English band that loves America by phonograph to tell us something about ourselves in 1974 than it was for a comparable band in 1964--especially since the 1974 band loves America's rural past, just like Ry Cooder.

The one that proves they really are P-Funk comes pretty early, however: ""Crooked Booty,"" which one doctor diagnosed and a better one prescribed.

Bowie does a song about international pop star Andy Warhol; more deeply cultured and deeply Brit, Dury does one for London pop visionary Peter Blake. His culture broad, informed, and utterly unhierarchical, his Britness rooted rather than snobbish or xenophobic, Dury has tended toward rock and roll music hall, but with the U.S. audience out of reach his music is drifting toward Europop cabaret, and sometimes his determination to ennoble the clich�������""I like you very much"" is preceded by a series of tropes that could have come out of a bad children's book and probably did.

There's not for everyone, and then there's this--Gary Lucas spelling Peter Stampfel on what started out a children's album and ended up half a children's album. Stampfel is a great singer only when both voice and heart are completely in it, and here sometimes he conveys more life than inspiration, maybe because even ""bad"" voices age. But Lucas's quick-pick guitar and groaned originals--however they began, ""Crawlspace"" and ""Sandman"" are children's songs now--tip the balance toward give-it-a-chance-willya. Includes a reeling ""Ring of Fire"" (""such a dirty song,"" murmurs Lucas, taken with the ""went down down down""), a postcanonical ""Rollin' Sea"" (""A wonderful place to hunt the snark/Or listen to the dogfish bark""), and three works of kidlike genius: the eight-year-old targeted ""Zoe's Song,"" the elaborately disgusting ""Rotten Family,"" and ""Captain Kidd,"" begun with Michael Hurley in 1963 about one Chris Lindsey, future Deacon of the Admirality of the Fellowship of the Sea.

The lyrics are indifferently crafted, and while their one-dimensionality is winningly perverse at a time when his old fans will take any ambiguity they can get, it does serve to flaunt their theological wrongheadedness and occasional jingoism. Nevertheless, this is his best album since Blood on the Tracks. The singing is passionate and detailed, and the pros behind him--especially Mark Knopfler, who has a studio career in store--play so sharply that his anger gathers general relevance at its most vindictive.

The absurd contention that by utilizing electronic horns and soul girls and big bam boom he's finally mastered pop fashion and state-of-the-craft production--I've actually heard this referred to as ""Disco Dylan""--proves only that his diehard fans are even more alienated from current music than he is. At best he's achieved the professionalism he's always claimed as his goal. No longer ""relevant"" enough to make ""statements"" that mean shit to any discernible audience--vide Infidels or, on this record, ""Trust Yourself"" (only if you say so, Bob)--he's certainly talented enough to come up with a good bunch of songs. Hence, his best album since Blood on the Tracks. I wish that was a bigger compliment, but debunking comparisons to Street-Legal are also way off--the arrangements and especially the singing are, yes, tasteful enough to support material that puts Elton John to shame. I mean how did he get that ominous calm, that soupcon of prophecy? And how did he come up with the toughest Vietnam-vet song yet?

Dylan's last cover album confused his followers mightily, not least because he called it Self-Portrait. And maybe he tossed this one off as per contract too--his boyish tenor and nimble acoustic guitar don't rescue ""Frankie and Albert"" or ""Sittin' on Top of the World"" from the taxidermist, and though ""Tomorrow Night"" could be a mean parody of Lonnie Johnson's sour-voiced original, it probably just sucks. But most of these old tunes he gooses or caresses to some kind of arousal--he clearly knows the sensitive spots of Stephen Foster's ""Hard Times"" and the antiredcoat jig ""Arthur McBride."" Not that he thinks such intimacy yields a self-portrait. Older than that now, he merely explores a world of song whose commonness and strangeness he knows he'll never comprehend.

But shaggy dog story or no shaggy dog story, ""Tangled Up in Blue"" doesn't belong, and neither does that supernal piece of crap ""Forever Young,"" because both are classic tracks from albums that precede Rolling Thunder and Desire, events that marked his epochal commitment to hackdom even if no one dreamed it at the time. On 14 cuts employing 57 session musicians, four of whom appear twice and none thrice, this collection celebrates that commitment. Its sonic trademark is the soulettes who back ""Changing of the Guards"" (Street Legal, 1978), ""The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar"" (Shot of Love, 1981), ""Silvio"" (Down in the Groove, 1988), and the magnificent 11-minute Sam Shepard collaboration ""Brownsville Girl"" (Knocked Out Loaded, 1986)--all obscure, all compelling, all cockeyed flights of prophecy or mythic narrative, and all featuring the backup pipes of Carol (sometimes Carolyn) Dennis, who I bet has been feeding him lines for two lost decades.

What no one ever mentions about this legendary Manchester concert is that the folk set stinks. It's arty, mannered, nervous, as if Dylan is sick of these songs, although three of the seven haven't even been released yet. And when they are, on Blonde on Blonde, they'll be band- if not Band-backed like all the others except ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" and as such relaxed, confident, committed, meaningful. Appallingly ideological though it is that anyone could have preferred this static display to what followed, the rock set is warmly received. This is not to say, however, that it lives up to its myth. You'll hear some of the most freewheeling, locked-in live music of the '60s--far more detailed and responsive than comparable Stones and Who, with Robbie Robertson so cockeyed funky he almost careens off the stage. You'll also hear some folkie fool shouting ""Judas"" and Dylan calling him a liar and, if you strain, somebody muttering ""play fucking loud."" But you will not hear the times a-changin' or Robert Zimmerman jousting with destiny. That stuff's for historians. And if we owe the historians for the terrific electric disc, they owe us for the awful acoustic one.

Although his voice is crumbling audibly and his band is too often static, Dylan remains one of our more thoughtful wordslingers in the ever-changing trad mode he's made his own. Still, the meme that this album is a major statement where Together Through Life was a holding action bespeaks the unseen hand of the autohype machine and the superstitious fears that attend 70th birthdays. Although the four trad relationship numbers that open build nicely on Together Through Life's strategy and groove, the closers aim higher with dubious-to-disgraceful results. For all its well-borrowed tune and well-digested details, nobody's putting the 14-minute Titanic ballad on repeat, and the seven-minute John Lennon dirge says nothing at half speed just like the naysayers neigh. That leaves four tracks, and how much you admire this record will depend on how redolent you find two of them: the quiet jeremiad ""Scarlet Town"" and the quieter love-triangle cut-'em-up ""Tin Angel."" I say they'd be better faster, possibly. As for ""Early Roman Kings,"" a black-comedy dis of the rich and richer, and ""Pay in Blood,"" folk-music death metal via sanguinary imagery and microphone placement, you gotta love 'em.

FALSE,B+,Hella Personal Film Festival,Open Mike Eagle + Paul White,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16777,"
Alt-rapper Eagle dominates this meeting of the oddballs, as vocalist-lyricists will. But it's the rockish samples of outlying London beatmaker White that define it, because their blatant indifference to hip-hop or EDM align Eagle with talky singer-songwriters like Jeffrey Lewis and Charlie King as much as with Kool A.D. or Serengeti. ""All my heroes is singers that can't sing,"" he ventures amid thoughts on cellphone dependence, barstool codependency, Obama flying by in a drone, and the skin he's in. So figure he already knows that the most powerful sonic here is a snatch of Lenny Bruce. That man had a sound.

FALSE,B+,On the Border,The Eagles,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3588,"
The critic in me has no doubt that this is their best album, although he notes that the male-bonding songs (which articulate an affirmative ethos) have more to say than the female-separation songs (which rationalize hostility into pity/contempt). And when the critic plays the record, the listener enjoys the Gram Parsons tribute ""My Man,"" the MOR-oriented ""Best of My Love,"" the vaguely anti-authoritarian ""On the Border,"" the permanently star-struck ""James Dean,"" and several others. But the listener is too turned off by what the band represents ever to put the thing on voluntarily.
"
FALSE,B+,That's the Way of the World,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1112,"
Trailing Parliament-Funkadelic in my personal post-Sly sweepstakes, but ahead of War (bombastic), Kool &amp; the Gang (culturally deprived), and hosts of others, this unit can do so many things it qualifies as the one-man band of black music even though it has nine members. Here ethnomusicology and colloquial homiletics are tacked onto the funk and soul and doowop and jazz, which makes for an instructive contrast--the taped-in-Africa Matepe Ensemble, whose spontaneous laughter closes out the coda, versus Maurice White, whose humorless platitutdes prove there's more to roots than turning a mbira into an ersatz vibraphone.
"
FALSE,B+,All 'n All,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1113,"
Focusing soulful horns, high-tension harmonies, and rhythms and textures from many lands onto a first side that cooks throughout. Only one element is lacking. Still, unsympathetic as I am to lyrics about conquering the universe on wings of thought, they make me shake my fundament anyway.
"
FALSE,B+,Raise!,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4714,"
As long as they hew to a few simple rules--up on the tempos, down on the bullshit, etc.--there's no reason why these fellows can't turn their sparkling harmonies and powerful groove into a pure, contentless celebration of virtuosity. I mean once a year--at least in theory. But this is the first time the possibility's ever even occurred to me, which must mean they felt a show of strength was due.
"
FALSE,B+,Touch the World,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1116,"
Though supposedly they've reconstituted as a lean quintet, the credits credit Maurice White and hired guns, notably Philip Bailey who sings lead on two cuts, shares lead on three, and backs up wherever. White gets only two compositions, which may explain why such a fabrication seems more in touch with the world than his solo album, where he made the mistake of expressing himself. Canceling out El Lay buy-a-song like ""Every Now and Then"" are the side-openers, the strongest protests this seminal pop transcendentalist has ever gotten down. Both focus on money, something he obviously has a feel for.
"
FALSE,B+,Stop That Train,Clint Eastwood & General Saint,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4717,"
If this album's enjoyably joky yarns and stoned satire seem to come from backstage while the debut's came from outer space, it's not just because the surprise factor is gone. It's also the settings, devised by Kingston's most dubwise studio astronauts on the first album but assigned here to rude Inity Rockers with ska accents and music hall tempos.
"
FALSE,B+,Echo and the Bunnymen,Echo and the Bunnymen,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4721,"
In a desperate attempt to market Ian McCulloch's crumpled shirts and skin problems (two of the most likable things about him, I'd say), Warners pulls two top cuts off Porcupine, counted by some a step in the right direction. Revealingly, they're the two worst things here, though where ""The Cutter"" is a pretentious dog (quills sticking out all over the little bugger), ""Back of Love"" is merely more histrionic than the competition. Suggested motto: ""Do It Clean,"" which here builds to a casual vocal rave-up in a seven-minute concert version that could almost make you believe these spaced-out student existentialists were rock-and-rollers.
"
FALSE,B+,Rockpile,Dave Edmunds,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=936,"
A glance at the titles suggests yet another ho-hum revival--Berry 'n' blues to go with a novelty-hit remake of Smiley Lewis's (not Pat Boone's, right?) ""I Hear You Knocking."" But a glance at the credits establishes that Edmunds played just about everything but bass himself, even on ""The Promised Land,"" apparently recorded in 1966. And a perusal of the titles adds Dylan twelve-bar, ""It Ain't Easy,"" and--what's this?--Neil Young's ""Dance Dance Dance"" to The Tradition. Sounds pretty weird, too.
"
FALSE,B+,Get It,Dave Edmunds,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=938,"
In which Edmunds convenes the Monmouth Rockabilly Seminar, featuring source material both standard (Hank Williams, Otis Blackwell, Arthur Crudup) and arcane (Rodgers &amp; Hart), recent research by Bob Seger and Graham Parker, and new monographs from Nicholas Lowe and Edmunds himself. Great stuff, although studious detachment don't necessarily do it proud.
"
FALSE,B+,D.E. 7th,Dave Edmunds,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=943,"
It's a measure of my respect for Edmunds that at this point his meticulous collections of oldies and newies impress me much the way good new Chicago blues albums do, and I vouch for number seven, especially the newies on side one. When was the last time you were more than mildly excited by a good new Chicago blues album?
"
FALSE,B+,Glad to Be Here,Bernard Edwards,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=269,"
Edwards's career training as a bass player doesn't suit him for lead roles, which means that what is basically a rather subtle Chic album may never sneak up on you the way it did on this fan. For what it's worth, the two Chic-est grooves on the album features Nard as vocalist but not bassist, leaving that role to synth whiz Ray Chew. Could this be magic?
"
FALSE,B+,Blackbird,Stoney Edwards,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6777,"
In which well-meaning producer Chip Taylor provides Edwards with a wonderful title tune about ""a couple of country niggers/Stealin' the rodeo"" while nudging him in a rockish, folkish direction, probably in the belief that he has a better shot at an audience over there. The results are hardly disgraceful, though Joe Cocker didn't get away with six minutes worth of ""Bird on a Wire"" either. But the straight country album Edwards did last year was a lot tougher. When people in Nashville get serious, they have a tendency to fall for pretentious schmaltz--that's the story of Mickey Newbury's life. A lot of this, straight country and folkish-rockish both, is too damn close to the edge.

FALSE,B+,Assassinator,Eek-A-Mouse,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1131,"
What kind of artist interprets the legend of Tarzan to the tune of ""Wimoweh"" immediately after outlining his ""Triple Love"" life just so he can revel in ""en"" rhymes(""ten,"" ""den,"", ""lend,"" ""bend,"" ""them,"" ""Ardenne,"" ""Hughenden,"" ""Gwen,"" ""Jen,"" ""Karen,"" ""they even make love with my best friend Ken,"" and of course the literal nonsense ""lah-den"")? A major eccentric who makes most of those who cultivate that image look like self-serving twits, that's who. Also an eccentric whose first three songs here start with death by gunfire.

FALSE,B+,Mouseketeer,Eek-A-Mouse,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4726,"
Prolific and then some, he's a little less consistent on this album than on its immediate competitor, and since there are no printed lyrics I'll probably never know what the anorexic was doing at Reggae Sunsplash. But the hot pressing and dubbed-up Henry Junjo Lawes production do compensate for his tendency to set all his songpoems to the same melody, leading off with his account of Queen Elizabeth's unscheduled audience and climaxing with an explanation (?) of how he got his name betting the horses.
"
FALSE,B+,Live,8 Eyed Spy,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4727,"
I've always had my doubts about Lydia Lunch, but this Chris Stamey-recorded tape establishes her beyond doubt as the most promising female novelty artist in the American underground. Unlike Debora Iyall, she makes no apparent distinction between sex and eros, which is why she's a novelty artist, but Iyall should follow her lead in the giving-it-what-you-got department. Pat Irwin's dissenting sax and George Scott's pushy bass are what they got, and where they got it was James Chance.

FALSE,B+,A New World Record,Electric Light Orchestra,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6780,"
Eat your diploma, Eric Carmen--after years of floundering, they've gone all the way and made a Moody Blues album with brains, hooks, and laffs galore. My fave is ""Rockaria!,"" about a lass who ""loves the way Puccini lays down a tune."" Granted, I initially thought it was strictly for those who got off on music appreciation in high school, like the lass. But now I think it's also for those who hated it, like me.

A New World Record aside, this is a singles band, which makes their compilation the European Tradition's answer to Bubble Gum Music Is the Naked Truth. I love that ""Mr. Blue Sky,"" almost my favorite is ""Turn to Stone,"" and how 'bout ""Telephone Line""?
"
FALSE,B+,Down on the Drag,Joe Ely,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6785,"
Ely's songwriting pal Butch Hancock, who's beginning to sound like a great one, contributes four more; if ""Fools Fall in Love"" sounds like a lame title, how do you like ""Wise men hit the bottom, Lord/A fool falls right on through""? But Ely himself seems to have run short of tunes, and except for ""Crazy Lemon"" (which gets across on the crazy force of its lyric and vocal, not on its melody), none of his songs call you back.
"
FALSE,B+,Live Shots,Joe Ely,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1725,"
Like a thousand blues and jazz guys before him, Ely is an American whose live album should have seen America first--not a year, a charting studio record, and a major endorsement after touring the U.K. The claim that this injustice was a corporate blunder is boogie bullshit: even prime material acutely performed sounds a little redundant in an artist whose fundamental is songs. Still, this is prime and acute. Let's hope he rides the Clash's tailwind right into downtown Lubbock.
"
FALSE,B+,Musta Notta Gotta Lotta,Joe Ely,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4731,"
Hanging out with the Clash hasn't been so great for Ely's music--he's rocking harder than ever, but with a forced urgency that detracts from the songs. Only ""I Keep Getting Paid the Same"" is heightened by his breakneck boogie, and both Roy Brown's ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" and Shorty Long's ""Rock Me My Baby"" would come across better if they rolled a little. Best in show: Butch Hancock's Spanish-tinged ""Wishin' for You.""
"
FALSE,B+,Lord of the Highway,Joe Ely,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1726,"
A decade of being told what a hot shit he is has Ely oversinging to signify his intensity, which is too bad: he might have snuck in ""Silver City"" if he'd talked the song instead of howling it. But when he keeps it light--pissed off at Billy the Kid or his girlfriend's karate lessons or that s.o.b. Lucky, who gets the lowdown on the honey he left behind--Ely rebounds like he's made of silicone. He's an honest man--when Steve Earle and Dwight Yoakam meet women who take self-defense courses, they're too fucking pure to admit it.
"
FALSE,B+,Love and Danger,Joe Ely,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1728,"
As these things are now measured, he's finally a country artist--a good one. You can tell by the way Tony Brown stops him from oversinging. By the way he lays into the similes on ""Sleepless in Love"" and the rhymes on ""She Collected."" By the way he writes nothing but love songs, including two stinkers. By the way Robert Earl Keen furnishes mythos and memories without filling Butch Hancock's shoes.
"
FALSE,B+,Past Life Martyred Saints,EMA,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15586,"
Erika Anderson claims ""Zen nihilism"" is what you get growing up on South Dakota's bleak prairie under South Dakota's endless sky, which sounds reasonable until you start counting how many South Dakotans feel this way: approximately one. So insofar as she pretends her willful pose is the holy truth, she's annoying. What saves that pose is the willful power of a presentation less Courtney Love or Chan Marshall than PJ Harvey--""nothin and nothin and nothin and nothin"" as an emotional reality that's her truth whether she's maxing out on free love or playing Russian roulette with a butterfly knife.
"
FALSE,B+,Death Travels West,The Embarrassment,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3592,"
Eight droning, astringent, strangely catchy songs about everything from the Lewis and Clark Expedition to ""There's no doubt about it my old friend's a monster."" The horror--the horror.
"
FALSE,B+,Kamikaze,Eminem,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17378,"
Strangely, the album he devotes to demolishing the Metacritic drones and social media ignorami who slimed Revival is more substantial than that clumsy labor of pride itself. That's because it's about hip-hop, his truest passion and sole area of undeniable expertise, rather than the larger emotional and political themes of what he conceived as a groundbreaking statement of principle. I mean, I like Migos, ""Hanna Montana"" as much as ""Bad and Boujee."" But anyone who got through the ambient overkill of Culture II without falling asleep should kick meth, and the parodies of the trio here are overdue--""Brain dead, eyedrops/Pain meds, Cyclops/Daybed, iPod/May-back, Maybach"" or ""Lug nut coaster [actual online-available consumer durable]/Lung jug roaster [set-up]/Young Thug poster [wham]/Unplugged toaster [cool]"" even more than the thematic ""Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of songs about nothin' and mumble 'em."" Similarly, the relationship songs are Kim songs that don't mention her name--metaphors for the emotional dysfunctionality of a narrator whose only show of relatable feeling here comes with his highly belated farewell to his D-12 crew. As for calling Tyler the Creator the F-word, can I mention that rebel without a clue Tyler has misused that odious term far more freely than Eminem ever did--and that the pro forma p.c.-ness of Mathers's apology (""hurting a lot of other people,"" attaboy) comes as a relief from someone we can hope comes to terms with conventional morality e'en now.

FALSE,B+,The Orlando Sentinel,Emperor X,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17084,"
In 2014, a testicular cancer survivor constructs weedy-to-wispy electronic/guitar-strum/handclap songs about getting your parents Medicaid and cell plans, President Sarkozy's bake sale, AI swim laws (??), Kafka shopping at Primark, dying young with resources and integrity intact, and just generally proving the Politburo right because we've got all this capital and what good does it do anyone? I wouldn't say he sounds happy about this, or much amused. But he is philosophical, because after all: ""One good effect of the crash / Now every altered state gets classified as work--at least enough to prevent an epidemic of a baseless adolescent philosophy."" Which scans, in its way.
"
FALSE,B+,"Greetings From Cairo, Illinois",Stace England,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13053,"
Roots-rock program music about the southernmost city in Illinois. He doesn't detail much vice, which was once the town's bread and butter, but there's lots of race--1909 lynch mob, segregated bus crosses big river, 1967 vigilantes, young Jesse Jackson stops by. Better researched than Sufjan, but not as evocative, nor any longer on answers.
"
FALSE,B+,What Is Beat?,The English Beat,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3597,"
With its remixes, live versions, and non-LP U.K. singles, this Jamaican farewell portends the consumer confusion of compilations to come. Strictly speaking, eight of its thirteen offerings are new to LP, but in general I prefer the original cuts (and sequencing), and I can't understand why the hot disco remix of ""Twist and Crawl"" was left out of the grab bag. Collectors might as well go for the cassette, which though it's slightly inferior audiowise does exploit the biz's sanest tactic to the noble campaign to scourge home taping by adding four tracks, two live and two U.K.-only, including the secret classic ""Wrong Side of the Bed.""
"
FALSE,B+,Music for Films,Brian Eno,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=446,"
Many of these eighteen cuts seem more like fragments than pieces, and although most of them provide subtle melodic or (especially) textural dynamics, the overall effect is a touch too willful in its impressionism for my tastes. Another Green World decelerating, which is a funny thing for movie music to do. Or maybe ECM with hindsight, a/k/a a tape splicer.
"
FALSE,B+,On Land,Brian Eno,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=449,"
In pulse, movement, and textural detail, this falls somewhere between the static Music for Airports (a bore) and the exotic Jon Hassell collaboration (a trip). Whenever I play it (usually late at night) I experience an undeniable pleasure so mild I'm not sure anyone would want to pay for it. Caveat emptor.

By way of the crass product advisory they deserve, let it be recorded that 1992's Funky Divas captures their cultural moment and this one beats it song for song, including mild pleasantries from their undistinguished debut and adieu. Say ciao to the queens of air-kiss soul.
"
FALSE,B+,Unfinished Business,EPMD,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1183,"
The full-sized hooks and understated groove still mesh, but fame has rendered this self-made duo less brazen and more arrogant simultaneously. The real money (and pussy) they now boast doesn't suit them any better than the increasing subtlety of their steals--they need tunes, not just beats. But beyond the humble origins described in ""Please Listen to My Demo"" and the dramatized public service announcement ""You Had Too Much To Drink,"" the overriding idea seems to be that stars can do it themselves. Which is the usual half-truth.
"
FALSE,B+,Gohead,Erasmus Hall,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4738,"
The best Clinton spinoff since the Brides (not including Bootsy, who's on board as well) makes the funk album of the year (not including rap, which I guess is where funk went). Of course, to hear Capitol tell it, George discovered these Detroit pros long after they had their own thing. In the nick of time, I'd say.
"
FALSE,B+,Don't Slander Me,Roky Erickson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4740,"
A garage rant about blues theology that built from blues readymades and accelerated on the kind of mad thrust you don't hear much from revivalists or anybody else, the now rerecorded title single was all natural timing and spirit possession, a paradise regained of rock and roll clich������������������. The album exploits this miracle--sounds like a bunch of would-be old farts (with genuine article Jack Casady lending a touch of authenticity) latching onto the old wildman for the kind of magic carpet ride other music lovers only collect. It's too precise, too forceful, too showy. And if you can bear the protracted tributes to Eric""You Drive Me Crazy."" Or ""Crazy Crazy Mama."" Or ""Bermuda,"" about the triangle.
"
FALSE,B+,The Evil One,Roky Erickson and the Aliens,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4739,"
Never a big Satanism fan, I've resisted this crazed and-you-thought-acid-was-bad testament from the long-wasted leader of the long-departed 13th Floor Elevators. But not one of the West Coast's new psychedelic rockboys has come up with half this many dirty guitar riffs, or anything that holds a candle to ""Don't Shake Me Lucifer."" And unlike the Flesh Eaters' Chris D., for instance, he seems to mean it, whatever exactly ""it"" might be.

She's compelling when the rhythm gets her, annoying when she pledges slow-motion devotion, just like uncounted party girls before her--and also like uncounted rock pros before her, which is more the point. Don't deny her her gimmick--received or stolen though this suburban salsa may be, it can getcha.
"
FALSE,B+,Be Yourself Tonight,Eurythmics,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4746,"
New wave's answer to Shirley Bassey is finally connecting with those of us who won't settle for voice-plus-hooks not because she shows signs of having a soul, but because she shows signs of having a brain. Of course, the two go together--her lush, brassy emotionalism is more coherent partly because it's grounded, less taken with alienation as a way of life. Dave Stewart's guitar doesn't hurt either. And neither do Aretha, Stevie, or Elvis.
"
FALSE,B+,Revenge,Eurythmics,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4747,"
Annie Lennox's rich, lustrous range and diction threaten to overwhelm these stripped-down arrangements, bringing such odious Annies as Haslam and Wilson to mind. But while you'd never call her enthusiasm natural, it's not forced or foolish either--this is rock and roll as sheer performance, its basics paraded with pride and a glint of humor. If only it was all side-openers like ""Missionary Man,"" recommended to Pat Robertson, and the V-8 airmobile ""Let's Go.""
"
FALSE,B+,Savage,Eurythmics,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4748,"
Beethoven-lover as Neiman-Marcus girl, trans-Asiatic jilt, real live pseudoferal yowl announcing the cock-crazy ""I Need a Man,"" synthesized pseudorathskeller clink-and-chatter punctuating the sarcasm-crazy ""I Need You""--this record peaks so high that I tried to ignore all the in-between. It's there, though--medium tempo romantic-as-in-movement pseudoschlock, edgier than their worst but not so's it cuts much ice.

In which a Norwegian sexpot or credible simulation of same devises ditties along the lines of ""I've got a credit card/Big as a whale/I want to buy your love/Is it for sale?"" By the stringent standards of the Black Eyed Peas, not deep, although ""Life Still Goes On"" tries. Not beatwise, either. But less well-fixed than she pretends, I bet. And seductively catchy, in which sexy helps.

FALSE,B+,So Much for the Afterglow,Everclear,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1216,"
Art Alexakis knows he got lucky and figures the surest way to maximize his success is to maximize his music, showing the strengths and weaknesses of someone you sincerely hope has found the investment counselor of his dreams. With his big riffs and self-aggrandizing evocations of a credible life, he's at his best working the timeworn audience-as-beloved trope. The title tune says everything he needs to say about follow-ups in the age of the one-shot.
"
FALSE,B+,T-Bird Rhythm,The Fabulous Thunderbirds,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4756,"
In theory I always appreciated this Texas party band's penchant for understatement--most white bluesboys demean themselves and the music they love by playing it strictly for raunch. But in practice their albums were, if you'll pardon my jargon, boring. So new producer Nick Lowe, who could find a pop hook in a field holler, makes a difference. Both sides open with fetchingly offhand ravers, Kim Wilson works his shoo-fly drawl for gumbo lilt, and the mysterious J. Miller contributes the irresistible ""You're Humbuggin' Me,"" which had me tearing through my Jimmy Reed records in a fruitless search for the original.
"
FALSE,B+,Snakes and Ladders/The Best of Faces,Faces,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6798,"
Not counting ""Pineapple and the Monkey,"" a special for all those who believe their quintessence was sloppy instrumentals, this showcases the good stuff from Long Player and Ooh La La. Lots of fun, a solid testament to a band that was never very much into solidity--and a little more of a Rod Stewart album than is desirable for peak flavor.
"
FALSE,B+,We Are the Rage,Jad Fair and the Shapir O'Rama,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1624,"
Although these 23 soliloquies in 46 minutes are a little long on noize-will-be-noize guitar, umpteenth collaborator Kim Rancourt (of When People Were Shorter and Lived in the Water, since you asked) does the 42-year-old boy wonder a favor by sticking up for himself. In fact, while nothing tops the climactic love poem only Jad could have written (""Her eyes are the color of a Slurpee""? ""She smells as good as pizza""?), it was Rancourt who gave him the definitive ""I Comb My Hair With My Hand."" And who sings several of the best soliloquies here all by himself.
"
FALSE,B+,Dangerous Acquaintances,Marianne Faithfull,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2249,"
More conventional than Broken English, which isn't to say it's less feminist. On the contrary, Faithfull is even writing her own lyrics instead of letting some man do it, and coming up with universal truths like ""where did it go to my youth"" and ""looking to find my identity"" in the process. And singing in such palpably broken English that she almost gets away with it. This time.
"
FALSE,B+,A Child's Adventure,Marianne Faithfull,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2250,"
Skilled work, hookful and lithely arranged and sung with a racked grace far more accomplished than the harrowing croaks of Broken English. If I were a woman in search of rock and roll models, I might well dote on it. But model rock and roll it's not--Broken English still got the power.
"
FALSE,B+,Kissin Time,Marianne Faithfull,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11546,"
She's a professional sufferer, to be taken seriously as who she is rather than what she symbolizes. That said, and despite two dull Billy Corgan copyrights, these collaborations with the likes of Blur and Beck are her best bunch of songs since--not Broken English, that's ridiculous, but Strange Weather or A Child's Adventure. And that said, its peak is a ghost closer from the '60s, Goffin-King's supremely untortured ""I'm Into Something Good""--inspired by Earl Jean's version, not Herman's Hermits', all feminists devoutly hope.

FALSE,B+,You're So Fine,The Falcons,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11455,"
I avoid Collectorland, a murky place where one-hit geniuses stab around in the dark and unidentified middlemen muffle the music. But raves on this group, which over the first nine years included Wilson Pickett, Eddie Floyd, Mack Rice, and Levi Stubbs's little brother Joe, overwhelmed my prejudices, and my eight months of listening were almost worth the trouble. These 16 cuts are pre-Pickett, and chief lead Stubbs is what you'd expect--like Pickett and Levi only less so. Wild and gritty in the smoothie era, the '50s Falcons made more of shouting uptempo harmony (and polyphony) than anybody but their producer noticed at the time, and revivalists should check out side one for covers. Side two starts getting generic even if the genre is their own.
"
FALSE,B+,I Found a Love,The Falcons,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11456,"
With Pickett replacing Stubbs and soul moving on up, songwriting gives way to performance, and when Stubbs rejoins the group the fireworks can get pretty amazing, especially with Don West's horn arrangement and Lance Finnie's guitar thrown in. But stylistically a lot of this is transitional, which means that often the fireworks consist of lead voices blending in like would-be smoothies. This is fine only as far as it goes.

After dismissing this as just too tuneless and crude--wasn't even fast--I played it in tandem with Public Image Ltd. one night and for a few bars could hardly tell the difference. Of course, in this case the heavy bass and distant guitars could simply mean a bad mix, but what the hell--when they praise spastics and ""the r&amp;r dream"" they're not being sarcastic (I don't think), and in this icky pop moment we could use some ugly rebellion. How about calling it punk?

FALSE,B+,This Nation's Saving Grace,The Fall,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4763,"
If the sentimental fallacy of good American rock and roll is roots, the sentimental fallacy of good British rock and roll is amateurism. Not that these veterans distinguished themselves from themselves before Yank guitarist Brix E. Smith righted husband Mark E.'s feckless avant-gardishness. Still, what they've arrived at now is cunningly sloppy, minimally catchy Hawkwind/Stooges with each three-chord drone long enough to make an avant-gardish statement but stopping short of actual boredom. And yeah, it beats roots by me.
"
FALSE,B+,The Frenz Experiment,The Fall,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4764,"
If Brix is so busy leading Mark into the valley of the shadow of sellout, how'd she let him get away with an album of vamps with recitation? Lyrics center around a title catchphrase--""Get a Hotel,"" ""The Steak Place,"" and ""Oswald Defence Lawyer"" are the cutest--and allude to crime. Vamps are mostly--shame on you, Brix--catchy.
"
FALSE,B+,Bandstand,The Family,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6803,"
When they kick ass on ""Burlesque"" or ""Glove"" or ""Broken Nose"" they sound raw and abrasive in the great English hard rock tradition, but the discords are altogether more cunning, and on this album their stubborn lyricism finally finds suitable melodies on ""Coronation"" and ""My Friend the Sun"" and the bittersweet ""Dark Eyes."" Their sexual anger is class-conscious, always a plus, and their sadness usually a matter of time, which they get away with when the melody is very suitable. And just as they begin to get it together they break up.
"
FALSE,B+,It's Only a Movie,The Family,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6804,"
So they didn't break up after all, but the close call seems to have mellowed them--this is their funniest, funkiest, most relaxed album. I know an autumnal Roger Chapman is a little hard to imagine, but this is a man of many guises--back in the beginning he sometimes came on like an opera singer. Pick: ""Leroy,"" inspired by ""No Money Down.""
"
FALSE,B+,Charity Ball,Fanny,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6807,"
Seeing this band live was a revelation--for women, playing old-fashioned tight commercial rock and roll was a challenge rather than a self-conscious historical exercise. But that's not why there's been such improvement in the studio, although the live show held a clue--drummer Alice de Buhr was the most exciting musician on stage. This record exploits her chops and presence, sinking the pop harmonies in a harder, funkier frame. The title tune is a pure raver that oughtabeahit, but almost every song has something--or several somethings--to recommend it. Which is a lot more than I'd say of the Hollies' latest.

If everything here had the propulsion of ""Like a G6,"" this would be 2010's answer to The E.N.D., forget the more likely-seeming candidate. Instead, a one-hit wonder their tribute to the Gulfstream 65 jet will remain. The other nine three-minute songs are more like little Fokkers--party-ready, Auto-Tuned electrohop whose disposable superficiality is an aesthetic principle and whose guest list is a reality show waiting to happen. R. Tedder of One Republic and S. Dogg of Faux Murder LLC? In this context, they could be the same dude. Not so Keri Hilson or Kate Pierson, however. In the morning, they remain hard-working Asian-American lads who respect their mothers.

FALSE,B+,. . . And His Orchestra,The Fastbacks,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4767,"
Ace junk guitarist Kurt Bloch is the orchestra leader, off-key heroine Lulu Garguilo his girl singer, and they care so much that if the mixes were cleaner they'd strike fear in the heart of the sainted Joan Jett. As it is, even the lyrics are pretty garage. Maybe next time they'll abandon their principles a little.
"
FALSE,B+,Big and Beautiful,Fat Boys,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4770,"
Just by announcing a ""stupid def side,"" they reaffirm their timeless message: stupid is def, def is stupid, all is one. Former sideman Dave Ogrin updates their beats without trying to tackle Rick Rubin head on. Their run-in with the Russkies is as meaningful a cultural exchange as ""Rapp Symphony (In C-Minor)."" And even more than their moving rendition of ""Sex Machine,"" the title track sits all over rap's serious macho heavies. It may even get these jumbo gigolos something good to eat.
"
FALSE,B+,Only Life,The Feelies,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3608,"
With rock and roll--music--as mystico-cerebral as the Feelies', analysis takes you only so far. In the end, you get it or you don't. Me, I find album three their most accomplished and least effective, and suspect that both its accomplishment and its (relative) ineffectiveness reflect the same crisis of growth. After all, this is rock and roll, not music; rock and roll has always had trouble with the mature perspective signalled by a couplet like ""Got a ways to go/So much to know."" Just because the perpetual nervousness of Crazy Rhythms and the pastoral lyricism of The Good Earth are callower, they fit the musical concept better. Either that or the concept is fading for me. Or for them.

FALSE,B+,Black President,Fela,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4776,"
Building steadily off unpolyrhythmic traps, underpinning/undermining the beat with multiple drums, stating and embellishing horn phrases and then stating and embellishing them again, repeating verbal taglines countless times again or varying them by a few words to strengthen his points, Fela has constructed Afrobeat, which to my ear is as like and unlike any competing African pop style as it is like and unlike any American pop style. It's just Fela, instantly recognizable, although not always instantly distinguished from other Fela. Distinguishing themselves here are ""I.T.T."" (""international thief thief"") and ""Sorrow Tears and Blood"" (""dem regular trademark""). That's three-quarters of the record.

FALSE,B+,Narvel Felts,Narvel Felts,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6813,"
An r&amp;b singer on the country side of the fence, Narvel recalls Roy Orbison (they both worked for Sun) or Ferlin Husky at the fountain of youth. Wotta voice--he even does ""Gone."" It should go without saying that I love sexy r&amp;b covers like ""Slip Away"" and ""Honey Love"" and filthy-minded country originals like ""Let My Fingers Do the Walking."" But even when he's maudlin and self-involved I get off some on his naked, nasal emotion. Sometimes I like the country side of the fence myself.

FALSE,B+,Fuera de Alcance/Out of Reach,Freddy Fender,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6815,"
N������������������ Baldemar Huerta, this South Texas legend is a real traditionalist, as he illustrates on the title number, a country song warbled in Spanish over a reggae backing track. Cutting ""Jamaica Farewell"" twenty years after Harry Belafonte went pop with it. Time travel is nothing to a man who's done three years for weed, a drug commemorated--along with wine, cocaine, and morphine--on a version of ""Junko Partner"" that made Dr. John blush as he tickled the ivories in fond support. And ""holding his hand and showing him the way is, no other than the great, incredible TV personality, Mr. Domingo Pe����������""
"
FALSE,B+,Rock 'n' Country,Freddy Fender,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1291,"
Fender is a wonder of nature--I just wish one of his albums was a wonder of human devising. This is his third LP for ABC in ten months, and like the others it doesn't get the essence of a man who can follow an incandescent country version of ""What'd I Say"" with an incandescent country version of ""How Much Is That Doggie in the Window."" That's the parlay that opens side two of Are You Ready for Freddy, his most satisfying side for ABC to date; this is his most satisfying whole LP. His tenor is so penetrating, his Spanish lisp so guileless, that it's a pleasure to hear him sing almost anything, but he doesn't transcend himself as often as seems possible; why, for instance, should ""Big Boss Man"" work so much better than ""Since I Met You Baby""? If only there were someone who knew.

FALSE,B+,"Another Time, Another Place",Bryan Ferry,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=453,"
Comedy routines are rarely as funny the second time around, especially when you've used up your best lines--""The `In' Crowd"" is the only zinger Ferry comes up with here. Elsewhere he who plays at corruption is afflicted with disease--lead poisoning, it sounds like, affecting not only his brain but also his lungs and his pants. ""You Are My Sunshine"" makes ""sense"" slow, but too often Ferry simply indulges his taste for the lachrymose on songs that deserve better.
"
FALSE,B+,In Your Mind,Bryan Ferry,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=455,"
Ferry has custom-designed a new line of songs for his solo concept, rather than borrowing from early Roxy or his humble forebears, and especially on side one the stuff is appealingly down-to-earth. But it doesn't go far enough. I used to think Ferry's big problem was the fruity baritone that epitomized his deliberate unnaturalness, but now I think it's the hopeless romanticism of his half-realized dreams. If he ever did convince large numbers of people to care about his obsessions, the result would be nothing more than a rather scary collective escapism.
"
FALSE,B+,The Bride Stripped Bare,Bryan Ferry,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=456,"
Maybe the smoke in Bryan's eyes has finally reached his heart; the apparent sincerity of some of the singing here makes those five-minute moments when he lingers ponderously over a key lyric easier to take. The Los Angeles musicians don't hurt either--the conjunction of his style of stylization (feigned detachment) makes for interesting expressive tension. And Waddy Wachtel is as apt a sound-effects man as Phil Manzanera ever was.
"
FALSE,B+,Street Life: 20 Greatest Hits,Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=459,"
Their third compilation in twelve years is the third to include ""Love Is the Drug,"" but I won't quibble. ""These Foolish Things"" was always better as a title than as rendition, but I won't quibble. The number in the subtitle follows the formula twenty = CD, and I'm quibbling. A great gift idea--for yourself you can buy less or more.
"
FALSE,B+,Dimples,"Richard ""Dimples"" Fields",1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4782,"
Except for Betty Wright's backtalking one-upwomanship, the prime originals here--""I Like Your Lovin"" and ""She's Got Papers on Me""--are standard-issue love-man come-ons, but ""Dimples""'s appropriation of the two greatest doowop oldies is self-aggrandizing sentimentality at its most audacious. And ""I've Got to Learn to Say No!"" leaves no doubt as to just what he gets from his earth angel in the still of the night.
"
FALSE,B+,We've Come for Your Beer,Fiends,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4784,"
This hardcore comedy highlight includes tributes to the MC-5, the Brady Bunch, John Belushi, and Bob Hope (""Die Bob Die"") among its twelve tunes or tracks or whatever. Not counting the perfectly timed ""Ramblin' Rose,"" my favorite is ""No More Drugs,"" an idea that's always good for a cheap laugh. Just wish more of them had as much tune or whatever.

FALSE,B+,Ziphansi Izintsizwa,Fihlamahlazo Nabochwepheshe,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4785,"
On several of the mbaqanga albums now available from New Music Distribution Service, the shock of the simple is neutralized by the dull ache of the monotonous. Here the beats remain pretty basic, and damned if I can hear the rude-bowed fiddle depicted on the cover, but the bass is active, there's constant squeezebox byplay, and the leader never shuts up, following song with harangue on almost every cut. Wish I had some idea what he was talking about.

These Wodaabe and Tuareg obviously put aside their cultural differences, because seeing the world like those Tinariwen dudes beats breeding cattle or camels, as the case may be. But so what? Their Wodaabe polyphony is a difference worth selling the world. Sahara trance-rock, Niger stylee.
"
FALSE,B+,Fine Young Cannibals,Fine Young Cannibals,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1254,"
Andy Cox and David Steele aren't quite up to Beat-quality tunes or the post-Caribbean funk that might compensate, and some will find Roland Gift's Brit-soul strain affected. Me, I knew he was singing about something real long before I checked out the lyrics, which testify as does all too little black crossover these days to an ordinary life of hard choices--a lot harder than whether to believe that woman, which rest assured does enter into it.
"
FALSE,B+,Clear Heart Full Eyes,Craig Finn,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15590,"
On a wittingly laid-back solo debut where the declamatory Hold Steady frontman knows he can't bring off the country vocals his best songs deserve, he nails three flat-out anyway: ""Terrified Eyes"" (couple destroyed by their hospital bills), ""When No One's Watching"" (snazzy scuzzball seeks needy women), and ""Balcony"" (she does with her new man what she did with her old man back when he was new). The rest tend more, how to say it, evocative. But at least they evoke specifics--Middle American dramatis personae as marginal as Wussy's.
"
FALSE,B+,We All Want the Same Things,Craig Finn,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17017,"
Finn's Americans are beyond politics. Barflies and hopheads, petty criminals unlikely to kill or maim, working stiffs with a hustle on the side, fuckups milking disability checks and insurance settlements, the musical lifers who bleed into all these categories--none of them are kids anymore, and of course, neither is Finn. My personal interest in this demographic has never been all that personal and continues to wane--I wish a few of his antiheroes had kids. But he sure can sing a sad story if you call that singing. And there's no denying the wah-wah hook of the opener, the musicality of the spoken-word ""God in Chicago,"" the unrequited love at first sight of ""It Hits When It Hits,"" or the secret love of ""Rescue Blues.""
"
FALSE,B+,In the Heart of the Heart of the Country,Fire Town,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4789,"
No oblique harmonies or trick meters or underhanded lyrics to prove how arty they are, just a blunt collection of pop songs that hauls out the hooks and hits you over the head with them thump-thump-thump. Which could and does get annoying when you're not feeling complaisant, but for the most part has its unfashionable charm. If you think the Smithereens are something, I dare you to play ""Rain on You"" three times. And if you don't, I double-dare you.
"
FALSE,B+,Fishbone,Fishbone,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4790,"
Looking like postmodern vaudevillians who've just signed themselves in at the mental hospital, with sartorial details appropriated from the Specials, Dizzy Gillespie, Jimi Hendrix, Stepin Fetchit, and whoever, these six black L.A. teenagers show a flair for visual outrage worthy of George Clinton himself, though funk is far down on an equally eclectic list of musical influences that subsumes metal, new wave, and cool-jazz finger-pop into a ska Prince Buster never dreamed of. It's all too scattered, without much songwriting focus beyond the Devo-meets-Clinton ""? (Modern Industry),"" but in a world of of Prince clones and ugly presidents these guys are cause for hope.
"
FALSE,B+,It's a Wonderful Life (We Gonna Have a Good Time),Fishbone,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4792,"
Songwriting on this Xmas novelty was so noticeable I thought maybe they'd reconstructed some obscurity from the flick of the same name, but the pissed-off title track's an original, as are Saint Nick as debbil-cum-wino, Christ as comsymp, and Uncle Scrooge as Uncle Jam. All are well-served by the band's feckless eclecticism, too. Call it a gift from God and hope it presages a brighter future.

FALSE,B+,Supersnazz,Flamin Groovies,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10877,"
This is some kind of cross between good-bad rock and roll and ""The Sheik of Araby,"" with just the kind of tongue-in-cheek aesthetic distance for which I have an unnatural weakness. The first three cuts on the first side give a representative taste.
"
FALSE,B+,Flamingo,Flamin Groovies,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3612,"
The mix and the groove are fierce enough to accommodate ""Keep a Knockin',"" ""Comin After Me"" is worthy of Chuck Berry, and ""Second Cousin"" could have been written for Jerry Lee Lewis, which makes a trinity. I do miss the wacked-out head of such Supersnazz classics as ""Laurie Did It"" and ""The First One's Free,"" but the fifteen minutes expanded on the last three cuts are a bigger problem--even the fast one drags. Sophisticated r&amp;r primitivists are supposed to know about that stuff.

Decorative flourishes and all, Flanagan's cocktail piano is as intelligent as easy-listening music ever gets--bebop as a received style. I prefer this to the classic Flanagan trio record--Eclypso, on Inner City--because I prefer the tunes (especially Monk's ""Friday the 13th""). Also because the less auspicious rhythm section--Smith (Jimmie) ain't Jones (Elvin)--merits fewer solos and breaks. And despite--tsk, tsk--the electric piano on the title cut.
"
FALSE,B+,Then Play On,Fleetwood Mac,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11046,"
I put this record on a couple of months ago, noted that the famous second-rate English blues band was mixing easy ballads and Latin rhythms with the hard stuff, and forgot about it. Much, much later I tried again. Well, it's an odd amalgam but very good. Recommended to the curious.
"
FALSE,B+,Fleetwood Mac in Chicago,Fleetwood Mac,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6827,"
Combining the recently released Vols. 1 and 2, this two-LP set lets five sincere but never sedulously irrelevant (cf. John Mayall) English lads explore their branches. It almost brings you back to those distant days when ""white blues"" was more than code for ""heavy."" Knowledgeable song selection, expressive playing--especially by Peter Green, who filters B.B. King through Santo &amp; Johnny with a saxophonist's sense of line--and lots of help from Otis Spann, Willie Dixon, Shakey Horton, and others makes the thinness of the singing seem like a tribute to a new tradition.
"
FALSE,B+,Bare Trees,Fleetwood Mac,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1263,"
Their new identity is ominously mellow, but at least this time it's recognizable, and they've upped the speed a little. A lot less muddled than Future Games and occasionally as rich as Kiln House, but so thoroughly homogenized that it's hard to remember exactly how the cream tasted once it's gone down.
"
FALSE,B+,Mystery to Me,Fleetwood Mac,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6829,"
I downgraded this at first because I doubted the continuing usefulness (much less creativity) of such smooth-rocking expertise. And I still do--when they achieve the contained, ""Layla""-like freneticism of ""The City,"" their professed distaste for urban ""darkness"" insures that the breakout will be a one-shot. But this album epitomizes what they've come to be, setting a gentle but ever more technological spaceyness over a bottom that, while never explosive, does drive the music with flair and economy, the least you can expect of a band named after its rhythm section. Even Bob Welch does himself proud.
"
FALSE,B+,Tusk,Fleetwood Mac,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1266,"
A million bucks is what I call obsessive production, but for once it means something. This is like reggae, or Eno--not only don't Lindsey Buckingham's swelling edges and dynamic separations get in the way of the music, they're inextricable from the music, or maybe they are the music. The passionate dissociation of the mix is entirely appropriate to an ensemble in which the three principals have all but disappeared (vocally) from each other's work. But only Buckingham is attuned enough to get exciting music out of a sound so spare and subtle it reveals the limits of Christine McVie's simplicity and shows Stevie Nicks up for the mooncalf she's always been. Also, it doesn't make for very good background noise.
"
FALSE,B+,Mirage,Fleetwood Mac,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4799,"
This is the safe follow-up Rumours wasn't, and I find myself alternately charmed by its craft and offended by its banality. After seven years, you'd think they'd weary of romantic tension-and-release. But despite the occasional I'm-scareds and can't-go-backs, you'd never know how much passion they've already put behind them--they write about infatuation and its aftermaths like twenty-year-olds. This is obviously a commercial advantage, and I wouldn't want to be immune to its truth. But pop music offers endless variations on that truth, and since only the most graceful are worth pondering I have to say that there isn't another ""Hold Me"" here.
"
FALSE,B+,Tango in the Night,Fleetwood Mac,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4800,"
Fifteen years ago, when their secret weapon was someone named Bob Welch, they made slick, spacy, steady-bottomed pop that was a little ahead of the times commercially. Now, when their secret weapon is their public, they make slick, spacy, steady-bottomed pop that's a little behind the times commercially. This is pleasant stuff, nothing to get exercised about either way--no Rumours or Fleetwood Mac, but better than Bare Trees or Mystery to Me, not to mention Mirage. Marginally better, anyway. In a style where margins are all. And all ain't all that much any more.

Brainchild of sometime Slash editor Chris D. and featuring a saxophone and an X-rated rhythm section, this eschews the no-speed-limit egoism of El Lay punk convention for a more matoor view of the world, based on the idea that horror movies are worth taking seriously. Not bad for a laff.
"
FALSE,B+,Roman Gods,Fleshtones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4804,"
This is where they get the junk-rock down--reckless enthusiasm plus the less stylish strains of late-'60s dance music add up to their own groove. But though it's hooky and endearing, it's short on what one might call nuggets, which is why a whole side of unexceptionably jet-propelled tracks tends to lose momentum. In fact, whenever I try to concentrate for even an entire cut, my mind starts to wander, just like with Jackson Browne.

Do dirty guitars, readymade chords and bass lines, and straight four-four make this now disbanded trio garage-rock? I suppose so, though rock and roll would be a better way of putting it. Either way I'm a sucker for guys who can turn a Carl Perkins chestnut into a Velvet Underground dirge and begin something called ""Jesus Christ"" with talk of aerosol sprays--which gets us to Mace, not to mention the ozone layer, in case you were wondering.

A live double recorded mostly in '80 and '82, when their fuck-it wasn't yet a defeat, this has the spirit. But though they were anarchists they were no fools, so they put their best material on their first and forever best album, leaving the profusion of originals finally available here to bring up the rear.

If you think I enjoy enjoying this epitome of new-wave commercialism, this pap beloved of no one but MTV-addled suburbanites (not even NME, ever!)--well, you're right. I'm not just being campy, either, except insofar as camp means the luxury of surrender to stupidity--in this case to sheer, sensationalistic aural pleasure, whooshes and zooms and sustains and computerized ostinatos and English boys whining about their spaced-out, financially secure lot, all held aloft on tunes Mr. Spock could dance to. There are too many slow ones on number two, so I don't play both sides indiscriminately like I do with the debut. But hell, ""What Am I Supposed to Do"" even has a decent lyric.

FALSE,B+,Burrito Deluxe,The Flying Burrito Brothers,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3617,"
The Gilded Palace of Sin was an ominous, obsessive, tongue-in-cheek country-rock synthesis, absorbing rural and urban, traditional and contemporary, at point of impact. This is a skillful, lightweight folk-rock blend, enlivening the tempos and themes of the country music whose usages it honors. Its high point is called ""Older Guys,"" a rock (as opposed to rock and roll) idea by definition, and though songs like ""Cody, Cody"" and ""Man in the Fog""--as well as Jagger-Richard's previously unrecorded ""Wild Horses""--obviously speak from Gram Parsons's Waycross soul, they're vague enough for Chris Hillman's folkie harmonies to take them over.

There's too much art project in this five-song cassette, but fanzines hype slighter, dumber, more received stuff as if it were their holy mission, so why shouldn't I express myself? A married couple blow (flute, ocarina) and beat (chopsticks, coffee spoon, plastic fork). A buddy lays down some organ. The encomium to John Quincy Adams and the comparison of Texas and Tennessee are equally fanciful and equally educational. ""Waiting for the Catfood To Come"" is an East Village ""Afternoon Delight.""

The hosannas and precious metal showered on this slight, self-centered reentry tempt one to overlook its slight, self-centered virtues. Fogerty's drumming has definitely sharpened, though he doesn't hold up the break on ""Zanz Can't Dance"" any better than Doug Clifford would have, and cut for cut Centerfield is catchier than his previous effort--he had nine years to come up with the tunes, after all. But the material just isn't Creedence-quality. The mythopoeic genre piece ""The Old Man Down the Road"" was the keynote single not out of commercial caution but because it's the strongest thing on the record, yet does anyone claim it's the equal of ""Proud Mary"" or ""Green River"" or even ""Rockin' All Over the World""? And is anyone foolish enough to believe that the generalized ""Mr. Greed"" (not to mention the simpy ""I Saw It on T.V."") has the teeth of ""Don't Look Now"" or ""Fortunate Son,"" or that his first-ever career resum�""Centerfield"" is a personal statement to compare with ""Lookin' Out My Back Door""--in short, that the genre pieces are illuminated by visionary flashes, which is what made Creedence a great band to begin with?

With Foley's posthumous albums patchier than need be, this documentary soundtrack is where to pay your respects. Before he passed at 39, Foley's resonant voice had been roughed up by alcohol and the crusty life, but his easy flow was always something to hear. Without the five keepers it shares with the Morlix tribute, its slow ones would be hard to take--""Our Little Town"" makes six minutes feel like a sermon so long the roast gets burnt--but Morlix doesn't do ""Let Me Ride in Your Big Cadillac,"" ""Living in the Woods in a Tree,"" or ""Cosmic Doo Doo,"" and all are candidates for canonization. Too bad both records pass on ""WW III,"" ""Oval Room,"" and the jokingly, shockingly sadistic ""Springtime in Uganda."" Foley clearly never thought living in a car diminished his citizenship one little bit.

""I didn't leave my room till I learned how to drive,"" Lou Barlow recalls about being 17, which is probably why he seems retarded to this day. He's not a thug or a dolt, God knows. But he has the awkward aura of someone whose social IQ is 100 points below his math-and-verbal, and I wouldn't bet his socks always match. This is so pretty it's almost a poem about quiet lyricism--and so passive you want to put crystal meth in its apple juice.

FALSE,B+,No Friction,Fool Proof,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1277,"
""Jazzmen Play the Blues,"" says the cover sticker. Such claims have excited me unreasonably ever since I witnessed Henry Threadgill and friends back Left-Hand Frank lo these many year ago, and what could live up to that? Not this, if only because no real bluesman (as opposed to rocker) anchors it. After progressing from Delta to New Orleans to bebop to lounge-organ, it settles into jazzmen's r&amp;b, with Pheeroan akLaff staying in Al Jackson's pocket on ""Love and Happiness"" but favoring a more swinging groove. Ronnie Drayton and Bernie Worrell make some lounge act, and ""August Wilson's Urban Blue Blues"" is what a young Ornette Coleman might have come up with if he'd tried to write a ""Now's the Time""--bent bebop, blues mostly by association.
"
FALSE,B+,Long Before Our Mothers Cried,Sonny Fortune,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11274,"
Support your local jazz musicians. Fortune is a sax player whose warm-up for the Wailers at Schafer turned my head around not with its originality--Fortune is a cultivator rather than a ground-breaker--but with its commitment to plain good music, from bop to new thing. A righteous thing to do with your life, and righteous to hear. Despite even the bracing piano comps of Stanley Cowell, there's nothing compelling here. But satisfying.
"
FALSE,B+,This Girl's in Love With You,Aretha Franklin,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6853,"
Although Soul '69 didn't convince me she was made for pop standards, this (basically appealing) mish-mash suggests that she's better suited to pop disposables like the title track and ""Son of a Preacher Man"" than to rock statements like ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""The Weight."" I admit that when she sings ""The Weight"" it sounds as if she knows what it means. But I still don't.
"
FALSE,B+,Aretha's Greatest Hits,Aretha Franklin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6854,"
Great stuff, but not the greatest--and not as consistent stylistically as 1969's Aretha's Gold, which it duplicates on eight out of fourteen cuts. As for the latest hits, well, Aretha's done better recently than the contrived humankindness of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" the contrived religiosity of ""Let It Be,"" and the contrived black consciousness of ""Spanish Harlem.""
"
FALSE,B+,Amazing Grace,Aretha Franklin,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=153,"
Because I don't think God's grace is amazing or believe that Jesus Christ is his son, I find it hard to relate to gospel groups as seminal as the Swan Silvertones and the Dixie Hummingbirds and have even more trouble with James Cleveland's institutional choral style. There's a purity and a passion to this church-recorded double-LP that I've missed in Aretha, but I still find that the subdued rhythm section and pervasive call-and-response conveys more aimlessness than inspiration. Or maybe I just trust her gift of faith more readily when it's transposed to the secular realm.
"
FALSE,B+,Let Me in Your Life,Aretha Franklin,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6857,"
Welcome Tom and Jerry (Dowd and Wexler) back--this isn't great Aretha, but it rocks steady even on the ballads. If she doesn't get away with ""The Masquerade Is Over,"" she does renew ""A Song for You"" with a fresh electric piano part and a good helping of indiscreet interpretation. Guided indiscretion, that's the key--her great gift is her voice, but her genius is her bad taste.
"
FALSE,B+,With Everything I Feel in Me,Aretha Franklin,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6858,"
Aretha has established herself as such a solid property--certain to hold onto a good-sized audience for years to come, but unlikely to expand any further--that it's getting hard to resist thinking of her as a cross between Frank Sinatra and Nancy Wilson, turning out collections as custom-designed as next year's Oldsmobile. This one's more ethereal styling--less bottom, more la-la scatting--is presaged by Young, Gifted and Black's exploration of the spirituality on black pop rather than Hey Now Hey's spindrift, and I like it fine. But it's hard to get excited about an album that puts so much of its soul into the codas.
"
FALSE,B+,Jump to It,Aretha Franklin,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4816,"
Luther Vandross is a great singer, and he's gotten a great singer's album out of Aretha. But he's not a great songwriter, and great singers do their greatest work with great songs. Sometimes great singers don't even know what a great song is, which is why we get to hear Aretha perform artificial respiration on Sam Dee's ""If She Don't Want Your Lovin'"" and the Isleys' hoary ""It's Your Thing."" And sometimes great singers are also great songwriters, which is why Aretha and Luther thank their stars for Smokey's ""Just My Daydream.""
"
FALSE,B+,Get It Right,Aretha Franklin,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4817,"
As long as Luther Vandross produces her she'll never do anything awful, but she might do something bland. Vandross's problem, obviously, is songs--he does his job on the title track, but even the one by Aretha's son outclasses his other four, which I blame in part on collaborator Marcus Miller, whose bass anchors the suavely pervasive groove. His virtue, just as obviously, is that he lets Aretha sing--there's a hoarse velvet grain to her voice here that turns Michael Lovesmith's ""Better Friends Than Lovers"" into a major statement and the Temptations' ""I Wish It Would Rain"" into an Aretha song.
"
FALSE,B+,"One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism",Aretha Franklin,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4819,"
This artist-produced special-price live double comes from somewhere inside her--her soul, say--that doesn't distinguish between the personal, the political, and the religious. Structured to evoke a real church service, every side interrupted by a lengthy patch of prayer/invocation/sermon, it offers scant beat and lots of vocal glory, with much laying on of harmony. Guests include Mavis Staples, the Mighty Clouds of Joy, Jaspar Williams, and (on three sides for fourteen minutes total) Jesse Jackson. At times it seems like a self-indulgence, but more often its refusal of commercial compromise triumphs. Call it her tribute to her daddy. And never complain about her taste in clothes again.
"
FALSE,B+,Through the Storm,Aretha Franklin,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4820,"
Of the five count-'em five producers who labored over these eight tracks, only Narada Michael Walden--who claims four, including three of the four count-'em four celebrity cameos--can assure a very modern pop album. But only in spite of Walden is it a moderately seductive modern pop album. Delegating the JB duet to dodos who don't have the sense to sample him, buying noncommital generalizations even Whitney can't resist twisting, asking Elton in on the title number, the man epitomizes pop as market research. Singing her ass off on some halfway decent tunes, the artist epitomizes genius.
"
FALSE,B+,So Damn Happy,Aretha Franklin,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12120,"
No, not that ""Ain't No Way,"" or that ""Everybody's Somebody's Fool"" either. New ones, shorter on tune hence longer on voice--a musical correlative of the way she blurs the erotic-domestic details of the relationships the songs are about. Instead, her singing embodies relatedness itself: the experience of human proximity, of emotion expressed subject-to-object.
"
FALSE,B+,God's Property,Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1944,"
In extremis, choirmaster Franklin's platinum-certified, year-in-the-Billboard-200 Whatcha Lookin' 4 relied on the reflexive gospel strategy of bowling sinners over with solo vocal glory, leaving the skeptic impressed but kind of tired. Here, however, he's generally content to throw his appealing baritone over the sociable interplay of his 18 sopranos, 19 tenors, and 15 altos, thus keeping the enjoyment human-scale. And in extremis we get the gloriously obvious ""Yes We Can-Can"" and ""One Nation Under a Groove"" samples, which Kirk's host renders so much more righteous than Suge's posse you figure somebody up there has had it with the Devil getting all the good beats.

FALSE,B+,Spiders in the Moonlight,Jeffrey Frederick & the Clamtones,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6866,"
Fredericks is the secret hero of my beloved Have Moicy!, but I had to penetrate a whole lot of received music before I could be sure that his own album was more than hippie cute. What it is instead is insanely funny. Dedication: ""We would like to apologize to our mothers.""
"
FALSE,B+,The Best of Free,Free,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6870,"
I could complain that the format automatically glosses over their austerity with an uncharacteristic catchiness, but in fact it sounds better and says more about them than Highway. Just as annotator Jim Bickhart claims, the band wasn't ""only effective at gut-level; it was effective as music."" But often the gutty moves--Rodgers's or Kossoff's crowd-pleasing flourishes--weren't musical, while the arty touches--the deliberate pace and general sense of containment--socked you right in the cerebrum. Which is why Bad Company grandstands, and why I'm on the critical fence.
"
FALSE,B+,"""Chill-Out!""",Free Expression,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12048,"
Less than five minutes of fusion-vet guitar-and-rhythm, hooked on a nouveau-honk sax part and bass-man lyrics borrowed from jeans ads, with an overblown ""Save the Last Dance for Me"" on the B, this is as marginal as a decent 12-inch can be. I was all set for get about it, or hit it with a B minus. Then my malfunctioning changer played it three times in a row.
"
FALSE,B+,Exposure,Robert Fripp,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2981,"
Fripp has always been a bit of a jerk, but over the years he's figured out what to do with the talent that goes along with his affliction. This concept album earns its conceit, orchestrating bits and pieces of art-rock wisdom--from punk to Frippertronics, from King Crimson to singer-songwriter--into a fluent whole. Maybe soon he'll get smart enough to forget about J.G. Bennett. ""It is impossible to achieve the aim without suffering"" isn't exactly big news, and old Crimson fans will swallow side two without the caveat.
"
FALSE,B+,No Pussyfooting,Fripp & Eno,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2979,"
Although art-rockers praise Fripp's undulating phased guitar and Eno's mood-enhancing synthesizer drones, they also complain that it all gets a little, well, monotonous after a while. That's the problem with art-rockers--they don't know much about art. I think these two twenty-minute duets, recorded more than two years ago, are the most enjoyable pop electronics since Terry Riley's A Rainbow in Curved Air, achieving their goal with admirable formal concision. What do the bored ones want? Can't have meter shifts 'cause there's no beat, can't have bad poetry because there's no vocalist, can't have fancy chord changes 'cause there's no key center. What's left is tranquility amid the machines, more visionary and more romantic than James Taylor could dream of being. Highlight: the unrestrained snake guitar on the unfortunately titled ""Swastika Girls.""
"
FALSE,B+,Evening Star,Fripp & Eno,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2980,"
This time F&amp;E take dead aim at the hit single they so manifestly deserve by breaking their magic music into four distinct pieces on side one, but as a result I find the total effect more static--the endings are disconcertingly arbitrary, while No Pussyfooting's full sides just keep on moving. Special award for the simulated scratch that decorates ""An Index of Metals""--one of the most reassuringly fallible moments ever recorded.
"
FALSE,B+,Before We Were Born,Bill Frisell,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=304,"
He can get too abstract in both jagged and atmospheric modes, and the eclecticism signals a sideman's record: it's more impressive than meaningful to pass from hoedown to skronk in a second and harmolodic hymn next cut. But it is impressive--also fun. And unlike his predecessor Pat Metheny, Frisell needn't turn to Ornette for urban grit or deep content--which isn't to say Julius Hemphill doesn't sound right at home.
"
FALSE,B+,Can't Take You Nowhere,David Frishberg,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4827,"
""You knock back the schnapps/You talk back to cops/You walk in the room and conversation stops,"" begins the album and title tune; ""I owe it all to you,"" he tells his ""attorney Bernie"" to kick off side two. These are the things this jazzbo songwriter knows, and he knows them well enough to delight non-jazzbos with an interest in exotic subcultures. Nor will they turn down the jazzbo pianist's Ellington or Berlin. But that doesn't mean they'll buy his beliefs that Frank Loesser is a great American hero, Zoot Sims the essence of swing, and (L.A. trumpeter) Jack Sheldon ""one of the most gifted of all jazz musicians,"" presumably because he gets work as an actor. Or forgive the ecology song he produces to demonstrate he's not a cafe-society cynic.

Shades of Gang of Four, Minutemen, Mission of Burma even, to update for appearance's sake, Dismemberment Plan, one of many bands Ian MacKaye hath wrought. Punk minimalism evolved into song forms that bifurcate like art-rock. Everybody hip to tempo shifts, rhythm changes. And on this album, finally, recording equal to the tough dynamics that keep Fugazi alive as much as its integrity and idealism. Political chamber music isn't what they envisioned. But it's what they've accomplished, and an accomplishment it is.
"
FALSE,B+,Golden Filth,The Fugs,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6875,"
Not enough Tuli and a touch too much Ed, but this LP--recorded June 1, 1968, at one of their last shows--is their scush-slurfing testament. The best tune was written by William Blake under the romantic sway of a lesbian troll, but you can tell the other composers are poets too--listen to the similes break down in ""Supergirl,"" or tell me that Jim Morrison knows somebody who ""humps like a wildcat"" (or anyway, knows enough to laugh about it). The music is, well, a mess, but a purposeful mess, and Ed Sanders's poems are dirty jokes at their most divine.
"
FALSE,B+,"Fugs 4, Rounders Score",The Fugs,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6876,"
Previously unreleased (Holy Modal) Rounders oldies (the original ""Romping Through the Swamp"") plus a mid-'60s best-of on the original rock-poets, with ample room for the musical genius of Tuli Kupferberg--including ""Morning, Morning"" in a version far lovelier than Spyder Turner's and the peristaltic ""Caca Rocka,"" a/k/a ""Pay Toilet Blues."" The musicianship will offend the fastidious and loses even me at times. But there's a sense in which the halting drone of these sessions, vaguely reminiscent of the early Velvets, is more appropriate to the Fugs' secondhand rock than all the classy folkies they later patched on.
"
FALSE,B+,Refuse to Be Burnt-Out,The Fugs,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4831,"
Rarely has an aging hippie lost his sense of humor with more grace than Ed Sanders, who could be wild-ass and even a little nasty on what looked like the brink of cultural triumph but turned careful and considerate once he realized the struggle might never end. Instead of degenerating into a ""bitterly bickering bitter-shitter,"" he's put his youthful idealism front and center. His laughs are gentle, word choices rather than jokes; with special help from Steve Taylor, latest in the proud line of folkie-Fugs, his lyricism is resilient, reedlike; and he preaches with sounder grounding in moral philosophy than Holly Near and Johnny Rotten combined. As for Tuli Kupferberg, who was in his forties when it all began, praise the Lord--he hasn't lost a bit of his youthful sarcasm.

Three pleasantly unkempt songs by a concept comprising Fleshtones guitarist Keith Streng, who plays almost everything, and R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, who plays guitar. The best is about owning a car. The second-best is what they like about the South.

FALSE,B+,Waiting,Fun Boy Three,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4836,"
From ""Our Lips Are Sealed,"" proof that a ""definitive AOR version"" (as the sticker calls it) can negotiate between cheery veneer and breast-beating bullshit, to ""Well Fancy That!,"" proof that not everyone who has problems with ""boy love"" (as men call it) is as self-serving as Howard Smith, David Byrne's production suits songwriting that has advanced beyond the undernourishment of their breakaway debut. ""Farmyard Connection"" lays out the class inequities of herb production. Elsewhere they're not in love with love.
"
FALSE,B+,Maggot Brain,Funkadelic,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1305,"
Children, this is a funkadelic. The title piece is ten minutes of classic Hendrix-gone-heavy guitar by one Eddie Hazel--time-warped, druggy superschlock that may falter momentarily but never lapses into meaningless showoff runs. After which comes 2:45 of post-classic soul-group harmonizing--two altos against a bass man, all three driven by the funk, a rhythm so pronounced and eccentric it could make Berry Gordy twitch to death. The funk pervades the rest of the album, but not to the detriment of other peculiarities. Additional highlight: ""Super Stupid.""
"
FALSE,B+,Standing on the Verge of Getting It On,Funkadelic,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1308,"
Although too often it lives up to its title, this is the solidest record this restless group has ever made (under its own name--cf. Parliament) and offers such goodies as Alvin Chipmunk saying ""gross mutherfucker"" and a stanza that takes on both Iggy Stooge and Frank Zappa with its tongue tied. It also offers this Inspirational Homily: ""Good thoughts bring forth good fruit. Bullshit thoughts rot your needs. Think right and you can fly.""
"
FALSE,B+,Tales of Kidd Funkadelic,Funkadelic,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1311,"
As with James Brown, whose circa-1971 J.B.'s provided this band with its horns and rhythm section, there always seem to be waste cuts on George Clinton's albums. The difference is that Brown's are intended as filler even when they come out inspired, whereas Clinton's feel like scientific experiments even when they're entirely off-the-cuff. The title cut here, a thirteen-minute congas-and-keyboard reconnaissance decorated with a few chants, turns out to be fairly listenable. Which I noticed because it's preceded by a catchy march called ""I'm Never Gonna Tell It,"" their greatest post-doowop experiment yet. Also out there: ""Take Your Dead Ass Home!"" Not to mention the horns and rhythm section.
"
FALSE,B+,Uncle Jam Wants You,Funkadelic,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1313,"
This is fairly wonderful through the first cut on side two, but in a fairly redundant way. Bernie Worrell's high synthesizer vamps sometimes seem like annoying cliches these days, and not even Philippe Wynne can provide the marginal variety that puts good groove music over the top--maybe because he sounds like a high synthesizer himself.
"
FALSE,B+,Reachin a Level of Assassination,Funkytown Pros,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1317,"
All clenched throat and quick internal rhymes, Boiwundah disdains ""white green,"" and he knows how to brag: ""I'm the debate master, you're just a masturbator."" Even stronger ""coffee with no cream"" comes from his DJ cousin Devastatin', who states his business with a ""Big Payback"" loop and never retreats. At their most bodacious--check the twisted horn intro/refrain on ""Here Me Now, Believe Me Later,"" which could have been ripped bleeding from late Miles or choice Art Ensemble--his beats are as out as JB's spaciest and jazziest. In short, this unaffiliated L.A. crew deserves better than to go down in the juice wars.
"
FALSE,B+,Fusion,Fusion,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11528,"
Intelligent incorporation of pure blues into a hard-rock framework, beautifully played and arranged, with a forgivable touch of pseudo-spade in the singing. Reminiscent of Steppenwolf, but more flexible (two vocalists). Worth a chance.

Released shortly after Honest failed to catapult Atlanta's solidest trap-pop hope into a Jingle Baller and longer after babymama Ciara started saving it for a Christian quarterback, this mixtape doesn't bother with radio-friendly. Far from it. Before it sinks slowly into the generic, it justifies openers claiming ""Radical"" and ""Monster"" with a five-track sequence that begins with the club hit ""Fuck Up Some Commas,"" ends with the outrageously catchy ""2 Pac,"" scoops up a fine Lil Wayne 16 along the way, and never tops ""Throw Away,"" a truer love song for Ciara than any hook machine he'd hoped would cross over: ""I came home last night to a menage/Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you/I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you/When you're fucking another nigga I hope you're thinking about me."" Actually painful. Strong like pop so seldom is. Vulnerable like pop so seldom is too.

FALSE,B+,The Futureheads,The Futureheads,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12669,"
There's that Ramones sense that songs should be short like life, and that XTC sense that songs should be complicated like life. So who could expect these young Brits to understand life, except to suggest, sometimes observantly and sometimes rhetorically, that it's dangerous? They don't fulfill the promise of the wonderful title ""The City Is Here for You to Use."" But they do make the most of the bitter novelty ""First Day,"" which starts fast and ends double-time, just like that job they were so lucky to get.
"
FALSE,B+,Federation of Tackheads,Jimmy G. and the Tackheads,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4851,"
Those who bewail George Clinton's drum-program conversion should get a load of the rhythm chip he has working on this collaboration with former Slave laborer and master of his own Aurra Steve Washington--not to mention Mr. G., a kid brother George hopes to save from a life of petty crime and presidential aspiration. The industrial-strength whomp of these willfully simple-minded tracks makes the big beat of the notorious ""Hydraulic Pump"" sound like something Trick James might cross over on. One nice thing about simple-minded--when it hits you you feel all right.
"
FALSE,B+,Regulate . . . G Funk Era,Warren G,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4136,"
Where his homeboy Snoop plays a well-chilled sociopath whose indifference to pain is the centerpiece of his carefully plotted menace, Dr. Dre's kid half-brother is more like a mischievous seventh-grader. Giggling at Bootsy's funny glasses one minute, selling crack on the corner the next, he could go either way, or both in tandem. His cool and his tough are less practiced, less cocksure, hence more dangerous--and more tragic. Teamed with the tunefully murderous Nate Dogg, he's nasty in a new, neurotic way. Giving work to the Twinz or Dove Shack, he's one more G.

FALSE,B+,Peter Gabriel,Peter Gabriel,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2734,"
Even when he was Genesis, Gabriel seemed smarter than your average art-rocker. Though the music was mannered, there was substance beneath its intricacy; however received the lyrical ideas, they were easier to test empirically than evocations of spaceships on Atlantis. This solo album seems a lot smarter than that. But every time I delve beneath its challenging textures to decipher a line or two I come up a little short.

FALSE,B+,Today,Galaxie 500,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1322,"
With their strained, murmuring Sprechgesang, half-speed raveups, and sobbing guitar, they evoke circa-""Pale Blue Eyes"" Velvets so beautifully you think they're an imitation until you recheck the original. Instead it's like Today's supposed to be as soft and gawky compared to The Velvet Underground as that album was up against The Velvet Underground and Nico. Like Jonathan Richman, source of the sole cover, they're sweet young aesthetes who love the Velvets without making them role models. ""I'd rather stay in bed with you/Until it's time to get a drink""--what kind of decadent is that?

FALSE,B+,Gap Band IV,Gap Band,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4855,"
Although women may disagree, I don't think the cartoon sincerity of Bootsy and the Ohio Players will ever evolve into romantic credibility. So while I'm not saying these total entertainers sound like Huey, Louie &amp; Dewey on the slow ones, I insist that they don't sound like the Temptations either--vocally, they're mere professionals singing merely professional love songs. Which isn't to deny that the funk tunes burn rubber and the funktoons drop the bomb.
"
FALSE,B+,Gap Band V: Jammin',Gap Band,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4856,"
Like Cameo and Rick James before them, these old pros blew their sure shots on the breakthrough--this drops no bombs. But once again the follow-up album compensates for never getting up by never letting up--the uptempo stuff steadfastly maintains their hand-stamped party groove, and like Cameo (forget Rick James), they've figured out what to do with the slow ones. That Stevie Wonder move is a no-fail--just ask George Benson, or Eddie Murphy.

FALSE,B+,Gap Gold: Best of the Gap Band,Gap Band,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4857,"
What a waste. If ever a band cried out for that corny old fast side/slow side split, it's the creators of ""Burn Rubber,"" ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me,"" ""Early in the Morning,"" and, God spare you, ""Season's No Reason To Change."" Taken in a single rush, the uptempo classics (augmented by a few expert imitations, including ""Party Trains""'s imitation Gap Band) would stand as twenty-five minutes of rock and roll so spectacular you'd never think to turn the damn thing over.

FALSE,B+,Garcia,Jerry Garcia,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6881,"
Side one sounds almost too pleasant and catchy, as if Garcia and Robert Hunter--the most consistent songwriters anywhere over the past couple of years--had settled a little too comfortably into the slow, traditional, blues-tinged country-rock groove the Dead have been digging recently. The payoff is ""Sugaree"" and ""Deal,"" classics no future-rocker could come up with. And then--surprise!--the second side balances (surprisingly unpretentious) musique concrete experimentation against the groove.

I complained about production clutter on her quickly deleted Arista album, but I must admit that David Rubinson injected a brightness that I miss in El Lay jazzman John Guerin's more tasteful work here. That could even be why the songs seem a shade duller this time. But Garthwaite's rhythmic and timbral adeptness remain unique in rock, and I'm grateful these days for any explicitly feminist analysis that is also both heterosexual and antipuritanical. Anyway, the songs are still a lot brighter than most.

FALSE,B+,What's Going On,Marvin Gaye,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2282,"
This may be a groundbreaking personal statement, but like any Berry Gordy quickie it's baited skimpily: only three great tunes. ""What's Going On,"" ""Inner City Blues,"" and ""Mercy, Mercy Me (the Ecology)"" are so original they reveal ordinary Motown-political as the benign market manipulation it is. And Gaye keeps getting more subtle vocally and rhythmically. But the rest is pretty murky even when the lyrical ideas are good--I like the words on ""What's Happenin' Brother"" and ""Flyin' High (in the Friendly Sky)"" quite a bit--and the religious songs that bear Gaye's real message are suitably shapeless. Worst of all, because they're used a lot, are David Van De Pitte's strings, the lowest kind of movie-background dreck.
"
FALSE,B+,Here My Dear,Marvin Gaye,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6890,"
The brightness of the disco remix Motown has made available on ""A Funky Space Reincarnation"" is a vivid reminder of how pathologically laid back Gaye is striving to be. I mean, seventy minutes of pop music with nary a melody line almost qualifies as a tour de force, and the third side barely escapes the turntable at all. Yet this is a fascinating, playable album. Its confessional ranges from naked poetry (""Somebody tell me please/Why do I have to pay attorney fees?"" is a modernist trope that ranks with any of Elvis Costello's) to rank jive, because Gaye's self-involvement is so open and unmediated, guileless even at its most insincere, it retains unusual documentary charm. And within the sweet, quiet, seductive, and slightly boring mood Gaye is at such pains to realize, his rhythmic undulations and whisper-to-a-scream timbral shifts can engross the mind, the body, and above all the ear. Definitely a weird one.

Not only does this lead off with ""I Will Survive"" (which I--unlike most--find too long in the eight-minute version now included on the repressed album), and ""Stoplight,"" a piece of inspired girl-group foolishness, it winds down into commendable filler-plus. Faves: ""You Can Exit"" (""If you don't like the size/If you don't like the fit"" of what?) and ""Anybody Wanna Party"" (which for once might induce me to). A better--and cuter--Freddie Perren album than Best of the Sylvers.

FALSE,B+,The Godfather of Rap,Spoonie Gee,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4860,"
Spoonie is so unreconstructed he talks the same old shit without even pretending he made it up--a little romantic vulnerability (not much) is as venturesome as he gets thematically. His rhymes'll sneak up on you, though, and his groove is so old it's new. Surprising a Mike Tyson fan is such a counterpuncher; Lee Dorsey as JB, he doesn't float like a butterfly--more like a waterbug on a shore current. Marley Marl is his match, deploying riff and dub and dissonance with a laggardly subtlety that'll pass hotbloods right by. So let me put it this way--Spoonie probably thinks Bob Marley stole his handle from Marl, and he's still the first rapper to come by his reggae naturally.

FALSE,B+,Monkey Island,Geils,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6898,"
For no good historical reason--1977 is hardly the year of white r&amp;b--this marginally offensive boogie cartoon has suddenly put together twenty minutes of music as consistent as side two of its 1970 debut. A hard one and a soft one and a cover and a closet-intellectual one and a pretty good one--that's their gamut, right? Overdisc, the nine-minute title track bombs and the other originals fail to take off, but the band does a number on Louis Armstrong's ""I'm Not Rough,"" splitting the hard part between Magic Dick's harp and J.'s guitar. So give 'em a hand, folks--they earned it.
"
FALSE,B+,The J. Geils Band,The J. Geils Band,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6893,"
I find this gritty Jewish r&amp;b band from Boston fun but somewhat retrogressive, which is admittedly the way I once felt about Creedence. Side two pops out of the box with covers from Otis Rush and the Contours and then slows down in style with two originals that deserve to get covered back. But the vocals don't do much for John Lee Hooker (no surprise) and the two instrumentals hobble the album's build (also no surprise, since great r&amp;b instrumentals are almost as hard to come by as great white blues singers).
"
FALSE,B+,Freeze-Frame,The J. Geils Band,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4862,"
For me, their best since Monkey Island if not the debut divides neatly into three groups of three: slick get-me-off trash (hit single plus two music-as-escape songs), slick get-'em-off trash (opener, closer, and ""Angel in Blue,"" a whore with a heart of brass that I'm just a sucker for), and slick get-offa-me trash (two throwaways at the end of side one plus ""River Blindness,"" a more pretentious try at ""Monkey Island,"" that album's sole bumout). If you're discovering the great audience these days it might even change your life for a month. But I guarantee you it didn't change the band's.

This punk band's notorious commitment to pop is evident mostly in surprising harmonies and song structures--musically, they're not trying to be cute. And although as singles ""Your Generation,"" ""Ready Steady Go,"" and ""Wild Youth"" never knocked my socks off, they're the nucleus of a tough, consistent, inventive album.

Forget bars 'n' barbeque--the 24-hour eatery of the title tune belongs to Dan Baird's new sweetie (""I just got to know if that thing is open all night""), who shouldn't be confused with ""Mon Cheri"" (""Her skirt rolled up and I could see she was French""). I know, I know, but trust me when I say their appetite makes up for their boogie recidivism. Sure they'd like to be the Stones, but they're smart enough to know they won't make it and young enough to take their fun where they can get it.

These days singer-songwriters are as likely to start out in Nashville as end up there, and though this literary thirty-five-year-old loves words too much to keep it simple and celebrated his big break by recording in London, he's a country boy at heart. When he falls in love he hears crickets and jackrabbits, when he tunes a diesel it sings like Patsy Cline, and when he gets to thinking about barn burnings and ""suicide amortization"" he writes one called ""Political."" Even his Dylanesque turns have their poetry, and if he betrays both his muse and his immigrant forebears with ""God Ain't No Stained Glass Window,"" just remember--country boys always sink into bathos when they approach the Almighty.

Carried beginning to end by force of vocal personality, the songs on this exceptionally unredundant 2007 mixtape are mostly undeveloped, as is standard for mixtapes. What isn't standard is that the guy with his name on the insert card is on all but two of the 23, and that one of the exceptions cuts tedious old Trife da God with excited young Termanology. Authorized Beyonce and unauthorized Amy Winehouse change things up, as does the mellow young thing whose ""to be with you my love"" replaces tedious young Carl Thomas on a ""Never Be the Same"" remix. Not that she isn't a two-timing heartsore anyway.

Neither of Gibbons's first two albums convinced me that the world needed a young Bob Seger--which meant among other things a craftsman who hadn't yet mastered his craft. But this time he's writing 'em and picking 'em with a sharp nose for the cliche. Assholes the world over cover Berry and Dylan on the live album, but they won't risk unrecognized classics like ""Tulane"" and ""Watching the River Flow,"" which is why they're assholes. And how many other craftsmen could imagine a mock myth called ""Gave His Life to Rock 'n' Roll""?

Produced, written, and directed (but not sung) by August Darnell of Dr. Buzzard, this begins with the seduction sequence from a fantastical '40s shipboard movie, establishing a tropical mood that pervades the record--sometimes lyrically, always musically--through its finale, ""Winter on Riverside Drive."" Like Dr. Buzzard, Gichy Dan mixes nostalgic fun and urban realism into something exotic. And though the melodies aren't always there, the life and imagination that were wrung out of Dr. Buzzard's second album have returned.
"
FALSE,B+,Human Race/Ra����,Gilberto Gil,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8238,"
How readily songs breach the language barrier varies inversely with how verbal they are. As engaging as Gil's vocabulary of trills, growls, whoops, keens, and discretionary phonemes may be, he's also a careful wordsmith, and listeners who don't know Portuguese feel an absence unallayed by universalist title or Jamaican rhythm section (though a printed translation might help). Which makes the relative legibility of Um Banda Um all the more miraculous--though it's worth noting that that title sounds like discretionary phonemes to this English speaker.

FALSE,B+,Expresso 2222,Gilberto Gil,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15461,"
Gil's first post-exile album included just nine songs in 1973, was picked up by three seamlessly upbeat bonus tracks in 1993, and kept them in its 2008 U.S. edition. Dimmed by three years of firsthand London fog, his Anglophile popcraft immerses in carioca beats and funky acoustic guitar worthy of Brazil's future minister of culture, often too much so--the grooveful six-minute ""Oriente"" is downright dull. Fortunately, most of the tracks chew banana-flavored Chiclets and take their samba with bebop on the side.

FALSE,B+,The Giant,Dizzy Gillespie,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11517,"
It's gratifying to hear how little the performing vitality of one of the creators of bebop has diminished over three decades; he's still making satisfying records. Personally, I prefer this twofer (a 1973 Paris session that features Johnny Griffin, Kenny Drew and Kenny Clarke) to the more recent Dizzy Gillespie Big 4 (done for Pablo Records with Joe Pass, Ray Brown, and Mickey Roker) because it stresses raunch and rhythm. But both albums are survivor's music: loose and quick-witted, almost untouched by the fierce inward turning that drove so many beboppers into one dead end or another. And that's probably just the reason that both lack the sense of conceptual urgency that hooked me on bebop.
"
FALSE,B+,Powerplant,Girlpool,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17051,"
Far be it from me to encourage punky minimalists to Learn Their Instruments on the path to Peace Through Art or Big Bucks. Too often that's a not-so-shortcut to sterile formalism or creepy-crawly commercialism. Yet the dream-pop these Philly-based Angeleno BFFs have worked up achieves a surprising softness, vulnerability, dynamic range, and melodicism. Cleo Tucker's guitar articulates and Harmony Tividad's bass complicates as some guy named Miles bangs the drums supportively. The only hitch is all the Explore Your Poeticism. More ""You'll build him a tower and he'll burn you a bridge,"" please. I want to know what you're driving at, meandering toward, or both.

Since these five females or others of the same name have been doing the old forced march since 1980, I assume the crucial exuberance of their recycled Sweet-metal is something of a simulation. But second-hand cock-rock it ain't--no rape threatened or implied. Just show business.
"
FALSE,B+,Symbol of Reality,The Gladiators,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4900,"
Albert Griffiths has never been a musical fundamentalist--1979's Sweet So Till, the group's first self-produced LP and only previous U.S. release, placed too much faith in synths, and when that didn't go over they went in with Eddy Grant, which didn't go over either--so maybe he's joined the Itals on this roots-conscious label because he's got nowhere else to go. But the same sense of pithy conviction that made Proverbial Reggae a classic album makes this a good one. The revival of the anthemic ""Dreadlocks the Time Is Now"" is no more impressive than the proverbial ""Mister Goose,"" which unfortunately is the only song about women here that bespeaks as much loving wisdom as the songs about Jah.

FALSE,B+,Einstein on the Beach,Philip Glass/Robert Wilson,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2763,"
I'd skip the Rolling Stones to witness this five-hour maximalization of minimalism again, but on record--condensed to four discs running about three hours--I find that its operatic conceit justifies itself all too well. This is ""great,"" all right, but without Wilson's spectacular visuals it's also, to these pop-happy ears, tedious and sometimes even pompous. In short, I'm glad to own it, but it didn't cost me twenty-five bucks, and I don't know when I'll find time to play it again now that I've done so twice.

""I've got a feeling, sounds like a fact/It's been around as long as that,"" goes my favorite hook of the past few months, which is something of an aberration: in the great tradition of post-modern pop these folky-arty Aussies abjure melody much of the time, though the second side does begin to sing after a few plays, and after much longer the textures on the first assume a mnemonic aura as well. A little static for rock and roll, but as poetry reading goes, quite kinetic.
"
FALSE,B+,Bright Yellow Bright Orange,The Go-Betweens,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11877,"
They say they're a band again, and I believe them--bye Forster, bye McLennan, welcome back Forster-McLennan. What I don't believe is that they're as integral or rocking a band as they once were, or that the strummy arrangements turn back on themselves like they should. But after longer than any neutral party will wait, the songs flower if not bloom into tints subtler than the noontime hues of the title. I don't mean the opener, which snaps into place with a classic identiriff, or the one where Robert wants to go to Brazil. Those are quick. I mean every single song. Too slow, too slight, still remarkable.

FALSE,B+,Ruins: The Complete Works of God and the State,God and the State,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4866,"
They played a typical minimalist grunge-funk in L.A. in 1983. The guitarist now studies philosophy in Toronto, the bassist architecture in Italy; the drummer has sold his kit. And on the cover they're considerate enough to provide their own review: ""The record was produced in ten hours, for $200 (US). There are a lot of jokes in the songs; but some listeners don't think they're funny, and others don't even think they're jokes, rather symptoms of spiritual decay. There is an intended message of hope, of finding power in yourself against domination and power's corruption; but some find the songs cynical and as glib as the clever people they occasionally denounce.""

Though the former Surf Punk is in it strictly for laughs, ""I know it's been done before/All my songs about boring stuff"" is as close as these six tracks some to a quotable joke. Though he varies his singing comedian's monotone with the occasional inflection or preverbalism, delivery isn't his secret either. And though the generically catchy, vaguely apt arrangements can make me smile all by themselves, I couldn't tell you why. Maybe there's something intrinsically funny about Southern California.

Unlike so many groups who live and die by the hook, this one's got hooks, and when you pay attention to the lyrics it seems possible that they don't live and die by the hook at all--""Tonite"" and ""Skidmarks on My Heart,"" to choose but two unprepossessing examples, work subtle twists on teen fatalism and obsession, respectively. When you don't pay attention to the lyrics, which isn't hard, you begin to think they live and die by the hook after all. And you're probably right.

FALSE,B+,Visions of Excess,The Golden Palominos,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3640,"
As formal experiments go, this packs quite a wallop, and not just because a drummer supervised the mix--Anton Fier clearly loves and understands that much-mocked arena-rock megawattage. But a formal experiment it remains, because neither guitars not voices carry meaning of their own. Jody Harris has always had a weakness for the genre exercise (as has Mike Hampton, for that matter), and the five stellar singer-lyricists sound like they were brought in to finish the tracks. Even in arena-rock that's not how it's done.

In antithetical ways, ""Train Across Ukraine"" and ""Citizen Boris"" are civics lessons for ""travelers third class,"" now known as ""workers seeking green cards."" But mostly the klezmer band that thinks a trombone makes you Balkan brass turns to the languages of love, including both English and the rhythmic invocations of a medium-raucous Yiddish-Gypsy wedding. Maybe you don't know what ""Tucheses and Nenes"" are. Lenny Bruce did, though. And you'll figure it out.

Their drawls as thick as their funk, they create a Dirty South at once more impenetrable and more inviting than Eightball's or Master P's--in feeling, one of hip hop's most neighborly spaces. Musically and verbally, they're too textural, but not even OutKast cultivates such territory with such care, and their Allmans homage/rip is almost as inspirational as this preachment: ""I'm sick of lyin'/I'm sick of glorifyin' dyin'/I'm sick of not tryin'.""

Finally free of the spend-money-to-make-money fallacy, a likable cult folkie puts together his most modest and most likable album. True, he's too sentimental when he's serious; even when he's funny he's too sentimental. His natural lyricism is a palliative, though, and when he's funny (about half the time) he's funny.""Vegematic"" and ""Talk Backward"" and the cruelly antinuke ""Watchin' Joey Glow"" may be easy jokes, but I ask you, why did the chicken cross the road? Hope he sells at least ten thousand.

Lyrically, Kanye &amp; Assoc. do little more than add ho and gangsta sidebars to the boss's core philosophy: ""Conspicuous Consumption Equals Authentic Negritude."" Usual suspects Pusha T and Raekwon sound better working this con than young jurks Big Sean and Chief Keef, and there's cleverness all around, with my pick the boss chorus ""We flier than a parakeet/Floating with no parachute/Six thousand dollar pair of shoes/We made it to the Paris news."" But close attention to the rhyming reveals all too clearly that the philosophy has gotten even lamer than it was to begin with. The surprise is that the attention requires so little effort, because there's always a musical touch to keep you alert: strings chamber and pizzicato, shouts and murmurs, cackles and whoos, glitches of every description, and a predictably unpredictable panoply of percussives. As with the virtual naturescapes in Samuel Delany's Stars in My Pockets Like Grains of Sand, you may never touch Gucci, but you'll know the texture of luxury just the same. And that better the hell be enough.

Listed at $7.98, this offers more than 100 minutes of well-recorded music from the master of bop tenor and group, and its availability is gratifying, but trumpeter Woody Shaw plays and composes like the worthy journeyman he is, and I know that when I want to hear recent live Dexter I'll turn to one of the European blowing sessions with Jackie McLean (I prefer The Source to The Meeting) now available here on Inner City. Even more scintillating musically (although duller aurally) is the Blue Note twofer, Dexter Gordon, featuring performances from the early 60's and lots of great sidemen. And if Savoy's Long Tall Dexter, from the middle '40s didn't run all the alternate takes together, it would probably be the best of all.

Gordon's affectless downtown tone sticks in my craw even though I've learned to have fun with it in other versions. But at least his new mewzick isn't deliberately cheesy. It's kitsch, but it's not cheap kitsch, not factitious so-bad-it's-good; in another time, snobs might have branded it middlebrow, meaning dolts like you and me think it has substance. As a here-disco there-jazz everywhere-semiavant soundtrack to life in media central, kind of fun--though more resistant than fun, or mood music, should ever be.

FALSE,B+,Brooklyn,Peter Gordon,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4877,"
On side two he's up to his usual tricks if not regressing a bit--first three cuts no better than the schlocky instrumental disco-rock they postmodernize, last cut no better than the pretty kora exotica it exploits (which if you're following means it's literally pretty--very, in fact). But side one, how about that, has real words--which are, it took me months to accept this, evocative (""Brooklyn""), romantic (""'Til We Drop""), and funny (""Red Meat""). In an oblique way, but Gordon's problem isn't that he's oblique, it's that he's too oblique. The right dose of oblique can be tonic in this crash-boom world.

""Oh, who's that? Oh, oh that's your girl, you're with her? She looks like everyone else in heah."" The dis caps a spoken-not-rapped intro mini-skit, and the intonation is perfect: Jay-Z in cute braggart mode. Grae can rhyme, and if she had a male larynx and a production budget (plus a little luck and additional applications of promotional muscle), her hype men, chipmunk soul, minor-key piano hooks, and ""I wanna rock a fella so bad"" might stand underground on its head. But she doesn't have those things; she's an ""insecure failure/Can barely maintain I wanna scream like Mahalia."" Thus her triumph remains strictly aesthetic, and pretty strange, which in the long run can only increase her insecurity. She needs a message bad.

This strictly post-Terry Knight compilation confirms my belief that they did most of their worthwhile recording with Todd Rundgren, although ""Bad Time"" and ""Some Kind of Wonderful,"" from their first collaboration with Jimmy Ienner, are definitive plusses. The strategy is clear in retrospect--back to their junk-rock roots with ? and the Mysterians and maybe even Terry Knight &amp; the Pack. Recycling riffs, upping the tempos, shuffling their limited vocal resources, and projecting the same populist sincerity that always made them more than a hype, they fuse their heavy beginnings with the hooks they were originally too mythic to bother with on this creditable testament.

The most spectacular of the Sugarhill crews on stage is also the hookiest on record, thanks to Flash's spinning--he can make his turntables give forth like a horn section of kazoos or electric soprano saxophones. But if ""Freedom,"" their Sugarhill debut, made aural graffiti-writing seem like a political act, here they remind us of its nuisance potential--it's fun to hear the Five's birthdays, and nice that each of us has one, but the idea is thin and so is Flash's hook.

Establishing vocal individuality without entering the cartoon territory that is funk's comic blessing and romantic/realistic curse, they locate rap somewhere to the left of the hardest hard funk tradition, James Brown circa ""Sex Machine"" and ""Mother Popcorn,"" rocking the body by pushing the beat (like Trouble Funk or the Treacherous Three) rather than teasing it (like Spoonie Gee or Soul Sonic Force). This almost athletic physical excitement, this willed and urgent hope, has been the core of their real message no matter what party slogan or all-night boast they've set it to. It's a disgrace that Sylvia Robinson's latest attempt to cash in their rep fades away to the forty-five edits that never did a thing for them--even ""The Message,"" which doesn't lose a word except its coda, surrenders an unbearable tension along with its instrumental breaks. Culturally depriveds who don't own such twelve-inches as ""Birthday Party,"" ""It's Nasty,"" and ""The Message"" itself are advised to settle if they have no choice.

When he's most original, Melle Mel's political chops are startling: ""Hustler's Convention"" closes with a right-on analysis, ""World War III"" resists thanatos and reminds Vietnam vets that they were dumb to go. But with Rahiem and Creole and Flash gone, idealism and romance are totally perfunctory, and original clearly ain't where they're heading: from the Prince rip to the Run-D.M.C. rip--both expert, enjoyable, even a little innovative--they come off as 1984's answer to the Sugarhill Gang, pros whose aim in life is to make more than chump change off whatever's on the street. Also, they can't sing.

There's an expediency to Grant's songwriting--try ""Latin Love Affair,"" or the equally routine ""Funky Rock 'n' Roll,"" or a rhyme like ""My heart does a tango/I love you like a mango""--that makes it hard to believe he's a hero. Instead of drawing some Caribbean analogy, I'd compare him to the Isley Brothers--artist-entrepreneurs with good intentions and a good assembly line. Of course, there's a ramshackle quality to the assembly line that saves even its most expedient product from slickness, and this is far from that--except on the hard-to-find Live at Notting Hill import, his good intentions have never been more out front.

This live triple is where everybody except certified Grateful Dead freaks gets off the bus, but I've still got my card and it ain't a joker. Sure they're beginning to sound very complacent--the whole ""Morning Dew"" side could be scratched, and the long version of ""Truckin'"" proves conclusively that the song doesn't truck much. But the best stuff here--the ensemble playing on ""Sugar Magnolia,"" the movement of ""China Cat Sunflower,"" Garcia's It Hurts Me Too"" solo, the lyric to ""Ramble On Rose""--is a lot more than laid-back good. It's laid-back brilliant. Most of the rest, patchy though it may be, is laid-back good. Also, I like the way they sing. (And write.)

Now, done with that id shit, she finds her voice by pleading with her man to stay or come back as the case may be. Her big argument: ""She Don't Write Songs About You."" She's pretty, she's rich, she cooks, she reads, she keeps house, she gives good head. Macy will grant all that. But she don't write songs.

FALSE,B+,Covered,Macy Gray,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15647,"
Ten non-Gray songs, three comedy skits, and three brief cameos for her kids and their high school pals. The songs are all post-1980, meaning post-song--from the era when bands began distinguishing themselves by sound. Credit producer Hal Wilner with isolating the melodically verbal in Metallica, Radiohead, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sublime, My Chemical Romance, and lesser lights. But 1) the high point is the opening ""Here Comes the Rain Again,"" an anthem on the face of it that Gray wrests from Annie Lennox forever; 2) a low point is the closer from the anthemic-on-the-face-of-it Arcade Fire, a major structural mishap; and 3) an even lower point is the Metallica centerpiece, which could be my problem but I bet isn't. Casting directors should note that the comedy skits are genuinely funny; Gray should note that I'm omitting the cameos when I put this in iTunes. But both are distractions. Fun as it is to hear her do ""Creep,"" ""Teenagers,"" and ""Smoke Two Joints,"" this is a bigger mess than it had to be.

Even though Ron House's whiny monotone gravitates toward the same melody no matter the song, each folk-punk arrangement stands out, and the lyrics show a sense of Americana worthy of a band from Columbus, Ohio--college town, state capital, boondock. Ever since high school I've been waiting for a rock and roll song about Mark Hanna, and I didn't even know it.

If they don't quite live up to titles like ""Chuck Berry's Orphan,"" ""Dick Clark,"" and ""Fertile Crescent,"" who could? If their organ-drenched four-four jams are objectively boring, they'll make you hum and pat anyway. If the organ-hooked ""Letter to a Fanzine"" is the sole masterstroke, hard-to-resists are almost legion. And if ""Why do punk rock guys go out with new wave girls"" is part of the parody, I bet these punk-wavers know the answer from experience.

FALSE,B+,Length of Growth 1981-89,Great Plains,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6142,"
Every goddamn drone and whine Ron House and his Columbus friends ever released, 50 songs that evoke both the punk that set them off and the alt-country they spied coming down the road. Quick, kids, where do the Great Plains start? Well west of Columbus, right? And by the way, who was this Mark Hanna guy? Pol behind four presidents fROMOHIO, two of whom were assassinated and one of whom Great Plains did a song about. Other subjects include Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Dick Clark, the fate of the family farm, how bad onetime Voice crit Don Howland has to piss, and, most famously, why punk rock boys go out with new wave girls. Not all of it is great, some of it is barely good, and I doubt even his thesis advisor would listen to House caterwauling 50 straight songs. But he knows that, and he wants you to hear them all anyway--surely you don't think he's in it for the money. A single album by Canton's own Marilyn Manson will cost you more than both CDs.

FALSE,B+,Al Green Explores Your Mind,Al Green,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=62,"
At first I found this a depressing combination of trivial ambitions and simple greed--the hit, ""Sha-La-La,"" is his slightest to date, and side two might easily have been unflattened with a cover. But I kept playing ""Sha-La-La"" to reach ""Take Me to the River,"" a synthesis of the spiritual root of Green's music (call it God) and its emotional referent (by which I mean sex) that may be his greatest song. And in the end I loved ""Sha-La-La"" too.
"
FALSE,B+,Have a Good Time,Al Green,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=66,"
Green's recent instability is usually blamed on hot grits and the short half-life of formula soul, but I'm beginning to wonder whether drummer Al Jackson, who died in 1975, wouldn't have steadied the last two albums, and I expect that this is an attempt to compensate. Wilson Pickett it ain't, but it is the straightest (and hardest) soul Green has put out since his breakthrough--the horns way up, the vocals shouting confidence and technique. Problem is, it's forced--the Hi folks (like most of their peers) can't turn out songs distinctive enough to hold up under the treatment. It's still full of fire, though, and Green is still the finest popular singer of the decade, and I'm still gratified to see him on his feet.
"
FALSE,B+,Truth n' Time,Al Green,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=69,"
Reports that Green was no longer writing all his own material worried some supporters, but in fact composition has counted for very little in Green's recent work and is generally improved here. This is his most careful and concise music since Livin' for You; in fact, it's too damn concise, clocking in at 26:39 for eight cuts, although the sustaining 6:07-minute disco disc version of ""Wait Here"" would have put it over half an hour. None of the originals are quite up to ""Belle"" or ""I Feel Good,"" but every song is solid, and two audacious covers of songs heretofore recorded exclusively by women are his best in five years. The intensity of the 2:12-minute ""I Say a Little Prayer"" (dig that male chorus) is precious in a time of dance-length cuts, and although I know Green devotes ""To Sir With Love"" to his dad, I'm glad Proposition 6 was defeated before its release.

FALSE,B+,The Lord Will Make a Way,Al Green,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4894,"
Think of it this way: he knew that sex was running out of inspiration for him, so he moved on to God as his source of ecstasy--an ecstasy he approaches most readily in what he really lives for, music. I might end up praising God myself if He or She gave me the most beautiful voice in creation and then let me keep it when I descended into purgatory. As it is, I'll praise Al for his lead guitar, which lends such a down-by-the-riverside feel to these rolling gospel tunes that you hardly notice the violins.
"
FALSE,B+,Tokyo . . . Live!,Al Green,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=71,"
You can tell when Green is bad live because he doesn't sing, often deserting mike or even stage for emphasis, which would be hard to render on disc. So his in-concert double had to be pretty strong. Like Otis's Live in Europe, it captures a sensitive soul man at his toughest and most outgoing. But unlike Live in Europe it offers no ecstatic epiphanies to make up for the forced crescendos--""I Feel Good"" is louder in this version but wilder on The Belle Album. And speaking of loud, somebody fucked up the drum mix.

FALSE,B+,He Is the Light,Al Green,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=73,"
It's not that Al's reunion with Willie Mitchell makes no difference--the difference is fairly striking when you listen for it. What's striking when you think about it, though, is that you have to listen for it. Leroy Hodges's famous bottom keeps the record flowing like none of Green's other Jesus LPs, but it's still songs that make or break--and in this case do neither.

FALSE,B+,I Get Joy,Al Green,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=75,"
By now he's B.B. King or Ray Charles--his genre exercises are more joyful than lesser mortals' great leaps forward. Only Al is more consistent, and he shares his genre with Amy Grant: pop songs addressed to God. What distinguishes this exercise is unflinching formal exposition--no Supremes or James Taylor ringers. Even the electrofunk belongs.

FALSE,B+,Your Heart's in Good Hands,Al Green,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=80,"
MCA is docked a notch for updating Don't Look Back by hiring Queen of Banality Diane Warren to write a new lead track, and then having Little King of Funk Lite Narada Michael Walden produce it. Jodeci's DeVante provides the other new one, and although Al schmears his mythic high range all over both, their timid low range sounds like nothing more than a suave market ploy up against the emulated Hi Rhythm and borrowed Young Cannibals propelling everything that follows.

FALSE,B+,Why Don't You Do Right? 1940-1942,Lil Green,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16058,"
Even more than Bessie Smith, this later as well as lesser blues singer--born 1919, recorded mostly pre-WW2, pursued sketchily documented r&amp;b touring career until she died of pneumonia at 34--suffers from formulaic recording, and fortunate though she is that her formula included Bill Broonzy on guitar, she lacked melodic outreach even though she preferred pop structures to ye olde aab. Her signature is a sexuality that's sly and lascivious rather than hearty and lusty, put across by a willowy soprano that's ready for anything. Often anything means just what men hope it does, those dogs. But it can also mean patient affection and, if ""Just Rockin'"" says what I think it does, a thrilling night of self-gratification should her dog be out chasing pussy. If there's an ace compilation hidden in her catalogue, no one's talking, but this equally downloadable old French job beats the recent Lil's Big Hits (on K-Tel, I swear)--even improves on 1971's Romance in the Dark, assembled by the discerning Don Schlitten for RCA. By my count, about half its 23 tracks distinguish themselves as songs. The rest distinguish themselves as style only.

FALSE,B+,In the Skies,Peter Green,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2737,"
For a supposed resident of Cloud-Cuckoo Land, Fleetwood Mac's original hitmaker is doing all right--this solo comeback is a lot solider than number three from Bob Welch (featuring ""Future Games"" as blast from the past), number two from Danny Kirwan (blonde on the cover), or number one from Jeremy Spencer (now apparently unborn-again, though six out of seven songs pivot on the word ""love"" and the eternal one is graced with syndrums). Green's new music goes back even before Then Play On, but it's a lot more confident--simple guitar excursions with a Latin lilt, like Carlos Santana with a sense of form (or limits).

FALSE,B+,Petaluma,Norman Greenbaum,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6948,"
In 1966, practicing as Dr. West, he hit with ""The Eggplant That Ate Chicago."" In 1969, his jug-rock album Spirit in the Sky fermented until it produced the 1970 AM longshot of the same name. So take last year's bland Back Home Again as premature product and enjoy this right-on-schedule one-of-a-kind all-acoustic project--a record about living in the country rather than escaping to it by a man who's taking his ""royalties/And puttin them into this goat dairy."" That's from ""Grade A Barn,"" but rest assured that this is a singer-songwriter whose knowledge of pastorale transcends the technical--as in ""I'm Campin,"" about how goat farmers get nature, and ""Dairy Queen,"" about a baton-twirling miss who longs to get the hell away from Petaluma.

FALSE,B+,Gravity Talks,Green on Red,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1456,"
Static on stage, its records diverting but ephemeral, L.A. neopsychedelica is yet another nostalgic, romantic, ""commercial"" extension of/reaction to an uncompromising rock and roll vanguard; it bears the same relation to slam-pit hard core as New York neopop did to CBGB punk. Since psychedelica was fairly silly even in the '60s, I'm agin it, at least in theory. I must admit, though, that the dumb tunes on this album not only stick with me but grow on me, in their gauche way. Just wish I knew whether I was laughing with them or at them. And when the verse about the dead dad follows the verse about the dead dog, I suspect the worst.

Dan Stuart's not so much an acquired taste as an arbitrary one--though I find his phony drawl kind of cute, I understand those who find it kind of hopeless better than those who consider it the essence of populist substance abuse. But his booze roots aren't ready for the mulch pile quite yet, and after too many plays I was surprised to conclude that his second Americana move was far catchier and more good-humored than number one. If you think it's hopeless, though, I won't argue.

Just when you thought he'd wandered off into dipsomania, Dan Stuart reemerges on Jim Dickinson's shoulder as Neil Young and Mick Jagger fried into one bar singer. With Chuck Prophet playing the blues and Dan wailing about careless what-have-you, this is the Crazy Horse album Neil hasn't had the jam to toss off since Somoza.

FALSE,B+,Little Love Affairs,Nanci Griffith,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2502,"
For Griffith, the notion that the past was better than the present isn't just a bias, it's a worldview--consider ""I Knew Love"" (""when it was more than just a word"") or ""Love Wore a Halo Back Before the War"" (WWII, she means). And with Tony Brown pushing her ever more firmly toward such marketable cliches as the raunchy growl and the pedal-steel whine, she's one neotraditionalist with a future. If you can forgive ""I Knew Love""'s purism, first side doesn't quit--the regrets of ""Anybody Can Be Somebody's Fool"" and ""So Long Ago"" are as permanent as they come. Second side's got John Stewart as Waylon Jennings and real country songs by the auteur.

There's nothing progressive and plenty idiosyncratic about Griffiths's quest for naturality, which is fine--in reggae, idiosyncrasy makes all the marginal difference.

More than any other rootsman I'm hearing, Griffiths keeps his spirits up. Though it's no longer in JA's cultural mainstream, there's tremendous life and variety to this music--falsetto play and jazzy interactions and catchy dubs, even an Elvis cover. ""It's Now or Never,"" in case you were wondering. And if you're still interested, it may just be definitive.

Initially, I took this jazzy Western bluegrass concoction for an acoustic variant on one of those session superstar instrumental LPs. But where it's the tendency of a band like the Section, for instance, to sound self-satisfied, as if getting stuck that deep in a groove were a spiritual achievement, this music is always sprightly, inquisitive, and surprising. Lightweight stuff, you say--I say it's airy.

What do people gain by resisting all this popcraft? Is AM acceptance so tainted that these proven riffs and melodies shrivel the soul on contact? Or does the way Burton Cummings shifts from rock to swing or croon to growl without any show of strain or even technique just make him ""slick,"" as they say? Granted, when I hear all the singles together like this I notice that since the romantic loss recorded in ""These Eyes"" Cummings has become unnecessarily spiteful. But songs that put down women and people who work for a living have never bothered AM haters before.

In which the Frenchman who inflicted the Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling"" on a hapless America--brute! vulgarian! snailsucker! 'ho!--bids for chart success as if he needs to be more famous than he already is. All power synths and squirmy earworms, dated beats and neutered Snoop Dogg, it offends club sophisticates no less than living-room discophobes. But with four-on-the-floor dance music the nearest the actually popular pop world came to mindless rocking out in 2011, I only wish it had a few ""I Gotta Feeling""s. Still, the two Nicki Minaj features come close, Taio Cruz does what he's sposed to for once, the will.i.am preachment makes its escapist statement, and neutering Snoop is fine with both me and the ASPCA. Front-loaded in this 13-track Americanski version--as a reward for their sophistication, the Europeans get to fatten up on excess instrumentals--it should slim down further by ditching the last two tracks and climaxing with the Jennifer Hudson love anthem ""Night of Your Life,"" where it simulates the soul that elsewhere is so beside the point.

Hopeless eccentric spends most of his adult life and a large chunk of his ill-gotten fortune trying to make the perfect album. Succeeds, kind of, on his own totally irrelevant terms. Nobody cares. Since he's no longer capable of leading young white males astray, this effort isn't just pleasurable artistically. It's touching on a human level. Noble, even. I didn't think he had it in him.

Produced by P������������������l Brennan of Clannad, the insufferable lace-curtain-Irish folkies who bequeathed Enya unto the world, and with Guo Yue's Chinese flute and Guo Yi's Chinese mouth organ carrying the melodies and Guo Liang's plucked Chinese harp plenty prominent, the instrumental affinities are self-evident. So I worry about the spiritual affinities. My working theory is that Maoist aesthetics knows the difference between dignity and gentility, enabling these exiles to formalize folk music into art music without draining its life away. Of course, this could be utter fancy--just as likely some arbitrary synthesis of acculturation and deep bodily need inclines me toward Chinese scales.

If somebody's gotta make exploring-the-folkie-mind-set records, oh Lord let it be somebody with a strong sense of history as well as a weakness for nostalgia. ""Ukelele Lady"" sounds positively intelligent backing one of Woody's heaviest antiscab ballads, and if the new ones about trains and booze seem slightly outmoded, well, that's part of the point, right?
"
FALSE,B+,Arlo Guthrie,Arlo Guthrie,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6960,"
This odd little record comes on like Arlo VII, which might rightfully excite semi-coma among the unconverted, but it's not. For once, Lenny Waronker's expertise produces music--playing and especially singing, not aural quality--that flirts (a little coyly) with amateurishness. Plus the record is political in a consciously oblique and sometimes fuzzy smart-hippie way. Arlo's Watergate song does justice to Tom T. Hall. And the two spirituals that make you wonder why he's fooling around with the Southern California Community Choir turn out to be about Israel.

With or without Junior Wells, Guy hasn't put so much guitar on an album since A Man and the Blues in 1967, and if anything this is wilder and more jagged. Which is great if you like your blues straight, without Otis Spann stitching a groove. I prefer mine on the rock.

I assume this 1974 live-at-Montreux was finally released because it features Bill Wyman, who does seem to know the parts, but saints be praised, he's not the star. Saints be criticized, neither is Wells, who was once a sharper, tighter singer. He's plenty soulful, though, especially on harp, and Guy picks up the slack--listen to him think on ""Ten Years Ago.""

Never thought I'd say this, but RZA isn't missed--the budget production enhances a master lyricist's specialty by subtraction. After dispensing with the ""horrific torture by prolific authors"" upsmanship, he's both factual, as on the doomed ""Short Race"" and ""Path of Destruction,"" and fanciful, as on ""0% Finance""'s renovated terraplane and ""Cinema""'s scary movie. RZA re-enters rapping on the farewell ""Life Is a Movie,"" in which a wild script takes off from humble facts but runs into trouble in production.

In the studio, trumpeter Tim Hagans's integration of turntables and samples into jazz combo ended up subtly and fatally stiff and segmented.

An album of Bob Wills songs, featuring genuine Wills sidemen with Johnny Gimble (as well as Haggard himself) on fiddle? Now that's the Merle I trust. His uncountrypolitan formal sense has always gone along with a reverence for history, and his subtle, surprisingly tranquil, yet passionate singing style--all that yodel and straining head voice--was made for Wills's pop-jazz-country amalgam.

An honest two days' work, but don't let the keynote tune fool you into expecting a lot of class-conscious reminiscences. ""California Cottonfields"" and ""Tulare Dust"" are welcome, but this has its share of romantic pap, and the nostalgia of the title bubbles too close to the surface.

I object in principle to music-with-commentary albums, and Haggard is hardly as forthcoming with his ""inner thoughts"" as the notes promise. But despite its mawkish moments--especially Tommy Collins's dead-mommy song--the material defines Haggard's sensibility in a winning way, and since not one of the songs is great in itself I guess the commentary must do it. For controversy, there's interracial love.

Also: ""Every Fool Has a String Section,"" I mean ""Rainbow,"" and ""No Reason to Quit,"" where his timbre, which has been softening perceptibly over the years, breaks definitively into self-pity.

The man has been making them for less than a decade, and thirty is too damn many. But this is clearly where Haggard wants to show off his range, and the display, featuring more original songs than he's put in one place for a long time, is pretty impressive. There's a rip-roaring infidelity lyric that's definitely one of his genius pieces--""Old Man From the Mountain,"" it's called, complete with bluegrass shading. And though after that only ""Honky Tonk Nighttime Man"" and the Bob Wills/Lefty Frizzell cover are liable to be remembered, just about everything else is liable to be enjoyed.

FALSE,B+,Serving 190 Proof,Merle Haggard,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2353,"
Its impeccable simplicity and sensitivity gives Haggard's fourth and best album for MCA an autumnal feel reminiscent of recent comebacks by Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. Granted, autumnal country music is easier to come by than autumnal rock and roll. But for Haggard, a mere forty-one but feeling it, the effect has thematic repercussions--and he's written a batch of wise songs to flesh it out.

""Wake Up,"" a devastating final-night plea that's one of Haggard's few great love songs, is the only original that transcends his usual poses, with ""Sky-Bo""--""That's a new kind of hobo for planes""--the most cloying offender. But Haggard's chief value has been vocal ever since ""Okie From Muskogee"" saddled him with an image, and here his resonant, reflective baritone transforms three Ernest Tubb tunes from standards into timeless pieces of Americana. If Willie Nelson is Bing Crosby, Haggard's Sinatra.

Though occasional jingoisms like last year's Amber Waves of Grain encourage citified ignoramuses to believe he can't see beyond Muskogee, over the years his musical sophistication has surpassed even Willie Nelson's. His Strangers are a stripped-down version of Bob Wills's Playboys, his soft timbre and lazy swing marks of a singer who'll never get old, and unlike Nelson he keeps writing. This compilation is overdue--he deserted the label in '81--and not all it should be. It draws too heavily on the all too conceptual 1980 Back to the Barrooms. Its two best songs may steer you away from the minor pleasures of the all-encompassingly unconceptual The Way I Am. And it's recommended to ignoramuses nevertheless.

Just when I decide he's gonna lay back forever he ambles into this. No Nippophobia, minimal love pap, a touch of Mexico, and lots of swing--except for one Freddy Powers pledge it keeps going till the obligatory sentimentality of the last two cuts.

Although Haggard recorded many more good albums in the '00s than in the '90s, his songwriting hasn't been this sharp since 2000's If I Could Only Fly. Not that every song flies, and not that he creaks so noticeably on the December-December ""We're Falling in Love Again"" just to make sure he conveys how ""making love 'neath the stars"" actually feels at 73. But his good-old-days laments taste sweet where once they curdled. You'd almost think he's grateful to be alive, which may just be why Johnny Cash's ghost gets to croak ""I watched it all completely fall apart"" on the lead track.

Haggard hasn't sung with so much care in years, which is obviously Nelson's doing--the difference between this ""Half a Man"" and the one on Going Where the Lonely Go is the difference between a husband who doesn't deserve to be cut down and a shit who does. But if Waylon brings out Willie's self-righteousness, Merle brings out his self-pity--Leona Williams doesn't want you to know it, but both of these boys have had more soft places to fall than any good man needs.

What was still authentic cacophony last time has evolved inexorably into avant-gardism, its jazz/r&amp;b elements articulated by ever classier sidemen. All 22 cuts are entertaining at least, and the musicianship adds listenability, which has its uses even with a singer who models himself on a wise-ass nine-year-old--""Silver and Katherine"" is almost ""beautiful."" But the crude, breakneck, sui generis primitivism has slipped away somehow, and for all his protean whatsis (he's definitely a maturing nine-year-old, a contradiction I come to praise not to bury), Jad Fair is less himself without it. As of now, anyway.

FALSE,B+,Charmed Life,Half Japanese,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1483,"
How can you not love a band who label the cassette version: ""Added Bonus!--10 Extra Songs Not Found on the LP""? Even if four of them are alternate takes and two or three others concern wrestling. Even if ""Madonna Nude"" (its coda a wrestling-style challenge to Sean Penn) really belongs on a 21-song vinyl version devoted to the love fantasies of a geek with glasses.

FALSE,B+,No Goodbyes,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6978,"
The three previously unreleased songs on this compilation--especially ""Love You Like a Brother,"" an ironic double or triple whammy--define worldly, media-saturated, serially monogamous singles (as in singles bar, though I'm sure they wouldn't stoop so low) as well as the best cuts on the well-represented Abandoned Luncheonette. The three songs from War Babies take on larger issues of concern to singles--destruction by stardom, etc.
"
FALSE,B+,Rock'n Soul Part 1,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4926,"
This best-of is where to get to know them, but I wouldn't sit around waiting for that marriage proposal if I were you. There's no denying the instant pleasure of such slick tricks as the seductive ""One on One,"" the bitchy ""Rich Girl,"" the inevitable ""She's Gone,"" and for that matter the sexist ""Manheater."" But in this pop era, instant pleasure never carries a lifetime guarantee.
"
FALSE,B+,I Witness Life,Tom T. Hall,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3983,"
I'm a fan of this Nashville original's most famous song, ""Harper Valley P.T.A.,"" because like all his best work it combines pithy narrative with pithy ethics. Its flaw is that its truth is metaphorical--it sounds made up. The two greatest songs here--""Salute to a Switchblade"" and ""The Ballad of Bill Crump,"" one an autobiographical tale of barroom violence (and discretion) abroad, the other a biographical tale about the death of a carpenter--are documentaries in rhyme. The method isn't original, foolproof, or the only one in his kit. But boy, is he good at it.
"
FALSE,B+,Faster Horses,Tom T. Hall,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3987,"
The first decent record by my former favorite country singer-songwriter in over three years. High point: ""Big Motel on the Mountain."" Rock stars are forever reviling motels, their readymade symbol of the impersonal rootlessness of life on the road; Hall obviously tore himself away from the soaps and game shows one day and deduced that the premises supported a life of their own. You think that says anything about the relationship between perceived impersonality and egocentricity? I do.
"
FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits--Volume III,Tom T. Hall,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6976,"
In which Hall goes to work for RCA and Mercury mops together some final product. Three of the four great songs--""I Can't Dance,"" ""She Gave Her Heart to Jethro,"" and the mind-boggling ""Turn It On, Turn It On, Turn It On,"" about the electrocution of a mass-murdering 4-F in 1944--date from 1972 or before, when it seemed he'd never run out of stories.
"
FALSE,B+,Everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels,Tom T. Hall,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4929,"
Returning from five misspent years at RCA, with his 1982 Earl Scruggs collaboration for CBS a halfway house, Hall delivers his strongest album in a decade and bitterest ever, chock full of death, decrepitude, and disillusion. In fact, T. sounds so down on himself you'd think he was an aging rock star--real truth-sayers rarely get this cynical. ""The Adventures of Linda Bohannon,"" the only yarn in his classic mold, is also the only song here to end with his patented shrug-and-chuckle. Life does go on, just like he's always said, and now that he's decided to give honest music another try he should get out and talk to folks again.
"
FALSE,B+,Choochtown,Hamell on Trial,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1492,"
Ed Hamell is a DIY folkie with a punky band who inhabits the sleazy corner where boonie bohemia meets pure low-life. Drugs can make that happen, as can marginal employment slipping toward petty crime. His pals Chooch and Joe Brush certainly don't read Hammett, maybe Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen for the warm weather. I bet Hamell reads them all--and that along with talk TV, they've influenced his narrative poesy.
"
FALSE,B+,Future Shock,Herbie Hancock,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4931,"
As a guy who likes his funk obvious, I think those who esteem ""Rockit"" as highly as Head Hunters are too kind to Head Hunters. Small thanks to Herbie, lots to Material and Grand Mixer D.St., it's the best novelty instrumental in years and the best pop of Hancock's life. Elsewhere various bright ideas, such as Pete Cosey, are obscured by the usual aura of set-piece dink--jumpy enough and often fun, but fusoid nevertheless.
"
FALSE,B+,White People,Handsome Boy Modeling School,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12565,"
Not the better class of white people, I'm afraid, although Paul and Dan manage to ground lounge-and-proud Chan Marshall, Julee Cruise, and Jamie Cullen more firmly than usual after feckless rocker Mike Patton gets away from them. Instead, what carries the album is, I swear, the skits--Guido Sarducci and Tim Meadows turn out to be as replayable as Posdnuos and Trugoy. Suitably, the very best of these, Meadows's ""Knockers"" (""Oh, wait one second, my illegitimate son is here""), climaxes the multipartite tour de force ""Rock and Roll (Could Never Hip Hop Like This) Part 2,"" the sole occasion when the perfectly interesting rock tracks hip hop enough. The hip hop, fortunately, hip hops plenty.
"
FALSE,B+,Hannibal,Hannibal,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11299,"
In jazz I've always been a saxophone man; I find trumpets too clean, so that even when Miles Davis is presiding I long for some breath of raunch to scent the proceedings. But this record, led by Hannibal Marvin Peterson over piano, cello, bass, and percussion, caught my ear immediately with its post-Coltrane strength and swing. I dissent as usual from the poem with percussion (about Africa, of course), but regard it as an appropriate price to pay for this fierce, coherent, auspicious trumpet music.
"
FALSE,B+,"Don't Follow Me, I'm Lost Too",Pearl Harbour,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4934,"
The rockabilly that Clash/Dury factotum Mickey Gallagher gets out of Pearl's anonymous sidepeople is crude and often a little leaden. But beyond the rare genius singer (Elvis, Jerry Lee) or player (Charlie Burton, Jerry Lee), rockabilly was always more attitude than fillip anyway, and for all their slap-bass oomph and sly guitar modernisms, I think the main reason the oft-praised Stray Cats like the style is that it lets them cover the borderline-racist ""Ubangi Stomp."" It's a little different when this half-Filipino woman--that's g-u-r-l, boys--resurrects ""Filipino Baby"" and ""Fujiyama Mama"" and then adds her own songs about sex manuals, fear of dentists, and ""Everybody's Boring but My Baby."" I mean, I do believe that's a punk chip on her shoulder, which in 1981 is the kind of wood I want to knock on.
"
FALSE,B+,Bleak Beauty,Clay Harper,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17369,"
In a counterpart to Mount Eerie's A Crow Looked at Me, where solitary guitarist Phil Elverum processed the shocking loss of his wife Genevieve to pancreatic cancer, Harper honors the passing of his longtime partner Stephanie Gwinn, who succumbed even faster to a brain tumor. But where Elverum's miserable minimalism grabs and haunts you, the mediated art blues of a shifting ensemble of Harper's pals is less devastated and less literal, though it never quite compels the total attention it repays. Lyric worth absorbing: ""Tells me what to think and objects to what I say / I don't know why / But I like it that way."" And how about: ""It's me again / I'll hold your hand / I'll be your man forever / But you sigh and then / Squeeze my hand / Say what if I don't get better""?
"
FALSE,B+,Profile: The Best of Emmylou Harris,Emmylou Harris,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1175,"
Lucky for Emmylou I don't know as much about country music as she does--the Louvin Brothers' ""If I Could Only Win Your Love"" and the Carter Family's ""Hello Stranger"" may well render her versions forgettable. But as it is, hers sure are pretty, like almost everything here, sung with undeniable care and charm. She also defines Dolly Parton's previously unrecorded ""To Daddy,"" as great a song as that great songwriter has ever come up with. And does all right by Chuck Berry.
"
FALSE,B+,"Def, Dumb and Blonde",Deborah Harry,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=992,"
Though she only approaches the daffy, wryly detached tone of past glories on maybe four songs (including a couple by the Thompson Twins), she's got the right idea and some nice touches--little recitatives, unassuming rap and house, Ian Astbury chiming in like Fred Schneider on Chris's occult number. The opener eagerly awaits the 21st century: ""I'll keep the money/You can have the fame""; the closer goes on elegiacally about the pastness of past glories: ""I knew it then/It won't be back again."" And in the end she's worth the trip if you can go CD, thus securing a lyric sheet and four add-ons, three of them punky.
"
FALSE,B+,Aereo-Plain,John Hartford,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1768,"
Insensitive though I am to tales of them thar pickers, I must admit that Norman Blake's guitar, Tut Taylor's dobro, and Vassar Clements's fiddle complement Hartford with tact, wit, and sly razzmatazz. But I insist that it's Hartford's funny, quirkish songs, rather than his banjo, that save me from continued boorishness. And warn that the songs are so grass-meets-bluegrass that remembering them sometimes gives me whimsy megrims and nostalgia headaches.
"
FALSE,B+,4-Track Demos,PJ Harvey,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2781,"
All right, so this isn't a cult artist's first ripoff. The new songs assure that. ""Easy,"" ""M-Bike,"" ""Hardly Wait,"" and especially the fleshpotted ""Reeling""--where ""Robert De Niro sit on my face"" leaves no doubt about whose blow-job queen she wants to be--share the kind of eager emotionality that makes Steve Albini cringe, and the same looseness animates this ""Yuri-G."" But I don't know how anyone can compare Rid of Me's ""Rid of Me"" without succumbing to its marshalled power, or concluding that with some forethought she could find even more juice in her sexual enthusiasm. She is a performer, after all.
"
FALSE,B+,Let England Shake,PJ Harvey,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15395,"
Polly Jean Harvey was major when she meant to shake the world, a life project she gave up on after releasing her finest album in 2000--much of it set, as must be mere coincidence, in New York City. Creating a suite of well-turned if unnecessarily understated antiwar songs, she's a gifted, strong-willed minor artist bent on shaking England in particular. How much that work enriches anyone's understanding of World War I is open to a debate too niggling to pursue. What's certain is that her special interest in the Great War reflects the changing contours of her chosen chauvinism no less than her evolution from the rough-hewn Howlin Wolf she absorbed in downhome Dorsetshire toward the dulcet clarity of Lancashire's prog-folk Annie Haslam. ""I live and die/through England/I live and die/through England""? You said it, lady--twice.
"
FALSE,B+,Deseos,Mariem Hassan,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13935,"
This strong Saharaui woman is one more singing cynosure whose solo debut proves she needed her band. Without the backing of Leyoad and especially the male counterpoint of Jalihena, she permits herself unaccompanied meditations where she has trouble maintaining the same intensity of concentration, ours and possibly hers. Hassan remains a voice to be heard. But if you start drifting away, cue up the groove tracks ""El Chouhada"" and ""Kalat Leili.""
"
FALSE,B+,Baila Sahara Baila,Mariem Hassan & Vadiya Mint El Hanevi,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17021,"
Right, Spanish speakers, it's a Saharan dance album where Hassan's indomitable voice is augmented by percussionist-dancer Hanevi's chirpier one. Tempos vary perceptibly, rhythms decisively, yet although the results are galvanic, they'll wear down anyone who hasn't internalized those rhythms. So although Lamgaifri Brahim is the guitar virtuoso here, I find myself equally drawn to the downtempo Nayim Alal instrumental ""Bleida."" A one-of-a-kind document most pleasurably consumed in controlled portions.
"
FALSE,B+,Aka/Darbari/Java,Jon Hassell,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1772,"
With much help from Senegalese drummer Abdou Mboup, Hassell fabricates ambient groove music. The rhythms lull rather than motivate, their goal contemplation rather than unconsciousness. On Fourth World Vol. 1, the goal was more like transcendence.
"
FALSE,B+,The Surgeon of the Nightsky Restores Dead Things by the Power of Sound,Jon Hassell,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1774,"
Minimalist trumpeter discovers keyboard textures while abandoning quasi-traditionalist surface, just like Miles Davis before him. But though it's also true that both men have done their schlockiest work while tickling the microchips, Hassell's impulses are so esoteric that a little schlock becomes them. I doubt he'll ever equal his first Eno project, and Power Spot is tougher. But if you're looking for ambient music that eschews new age sweetener, this'll calm your nerves real nice.
"
FALSE,B+,Suffer No More: The Ted Hawkins Story,Ted Hawkins,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3429,"
Maybe the radical alarm and homely detail of ""Sorry You're Sick"" are less unguarded than they seem--this guy made his living disarming passersby. Even so, Hawkins's two Rounder releases achieve an aesthetic of the natural--songs about combs, about doing the dishes, about vagrant desire. The U.K.-only late-'80s selections are pedestrian by comparison--beautifully sung, but incompletely imagined and indifferently arranged. Because compiler Gary Stewart thinks like a collector and adores Hawkins, a summing-up that might have established an American original is only a misleading introduction--to an American original.
"
FALSE,B+,"Quark, Strangeness and Charm",Hawkwind,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1507,"
In the old days, this likable British band played more benefits than Joan Baez and helped give psychedelic rock its bad name--when you repeat three chords in 4/4 for forty-five minutes, it's politic to change riffs once in a while. Yet they're still around, and good for them. Here they manage to spread six songs over eight cuts--a trick accomplished by granting two rather ponderous jams names and numbers of their own--as well as introducing more substantial innovations: for every song there's a good new riff, and by now the old sci-fi/counterculture themes mean something, probably because lyricist Robert Calvert has gained wit and wisdom since the time of zonk. Irresistible: the title cut, which suggests that Einstein had trouble with girls because he didn't dig subatomic physics.
"
FALSE,B+,Bebe Le Strange,Heart,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4944,"
So Nancy Wilson breaks up with her fella, soundman Mike Fisher, who naturally departs the band, along with his brother Roger, who happens to be the guitarist. And whether it's the absence of pomp-rockish Roger, stripping to a five-piece, or what hell hath no fury like, suddenly they're lean and mean and playing to the sisters--title cut's a fan letter to the female Johnny B. Goode, who I guess is Nancy, now playing a lot of lead. Take note, fellas--as Zep rips go, this one is something special, and not just for its sexual politics. Unfortunately, things go gushy at the end with an Ann-penned love song. Men--who needs 'em?
"
FALSE,B+,Heaven 17,Heaven 17,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4947,"
As communiques--in Britain, where this group speaks directly to a general youth public--these cool-to-gnomic commentaries on a modernity in which jobs aren't roles, dreams aren't ideals, and the personal isn't quite the political undoubtedly earn some anthemic aura. As artifacts--in the U.S., where this group is sometimes confused with Duran Duran--they're dance music, albeit with generally thought-provoking hooks.
"
FALSE,B+,The Luxury Gap,Heaven 17,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1509,"
Although their second U.S. album lacks the surface appeal of the debut compilation, it runs deeper, and politics makes the difference--not because their conscience impels them to come up with likable protest novelties like ""Fascist Groove Thing"" and ""Let's All Make a Bomb,"" but because their compassion induces them to explore a subject to which they have privileged access. Nowhere else in music or sociology will you learn so much about the would-be hedonists who live the technopop/Anglodisco life. Obsessed with an upward mobility that fails to produce the advertised highs, their protagonists suffer the weariness known only to those who habitually overtax their wills. And Glen Gregory's cultivated, well-meaning vocals combine concerned observation with hard experience just soulfully enough.

FALSE,B+,"Too Dumb for Suicide: Tim Heidecker's Trump
Songs",Tim Heidecker,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17206,"
Satire is too good for this potbellied pigwad, this flab-dicked jism drizzler, this ADD SOB, this pustule in a truss, this snake oil salesman in a cancer ward, this, I don't know, real estate man. Loathing is all he deserves, and loathing is hard to put into words, so that even a rhetorician as committed as comedian and challenged singer Heidecker has trouble finding language beyond the magnificent ""Imperial Bathroom,"" a detailed description of *****'s black, rocklike, KFC-informed feces that's keyed to the useful catchphrase ""Trump dump"" and culminates by predicting he'll die on the porcelain throne. But to be fair, ""Wilbur Ross"" and ""Cooked Chinese Chicken"" do pack bite if not bile, as does Heidecker's account of his own brave death in the dungeons of Trump Tower. And ""Sentencing Day""'s fantasy of ***** shitting in a pail and/or hanging in the sun is kinda sweet. But where's last spring's Father John Misty collab ""I Am a Cuck,"" a sharper song by far than ""Trump's Private Pilot,"" which gets a Misty remake for musical cred here? Face it, Tim--*****'s pilot is licensed to kiss ass. Motherfucker attracts toadies like a sump full of lily pads.

FALSE,B+,R.I.P.,Richard Hell,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4949,"
Supposedly the farewell of annotator Lester Meyers to his alter ego Hell, this fourteen-song all-previously-unreleased compilation begins with Johnny Thunders in New York, ends with Ziggy Modeliste in New Orleans, and preserves seven new songs and eight new Robert Quine cuts. What could be bad? you ask perspicaciously, and yet I'm a little disappointed. Only Fats Domino's ""I Live My Life"" and a painful lament for a masochist groupie called ""Hurt Me"" would improve Blank Generation or even Destiny Street, and the alternate versions alter nothing. Recommended to Walkpeople.
"
FALSE,B+,Band of Gypsys,Jimi Hendrix,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1691,"
Because Billy Cox and Buddy Miles are committed (not to say limited) to a straight 4/4 with a slight funk bump, Hendrix has never sounded more earthbound. ""Who Knows,"" based on a blues elemental, and ""Machine Gun,"" a peacemonger's long-overdue declaration of war, are as powerful if not as complex as anything he's ever put on record. But except on the rapid-fire ""Message to Love"" he just plays simple wah-wah patterns for a lot of side two. Not bad for a live rock album, because Hendrix is the music's nonpareil improvisor. But for a Hendrix album, not great.
"
FALSE,B+,Crash Landing,Jimi Hendrix,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7001,"
The studio guys producer-curator Alan Douglas assigned to provide proper tracks (he claims the originals were unreleasable, though one must wonder whether he could have grabbed all that composition credit if he'd put 'em out untouched) do a surprisingly competent job. In fact, I don't even blame them for the competent lifelessness of side one--Jimi was a pretty fair city songwriter (cf. such guitar whizzes as Clapton, Garcia, Page, Trower, Marino, Beck), but his legacy can't be infinite. Side two, however, includes the best hook here--a soul consciousness chant called ""With the Power"" that features Buddy Miles and Billy Cox--as well as two astonishing instrumental showpieces, ""Peace in Mississippi"" (feedback heaven) and ""Captain Coconut"" (studio space).
"
FALSE,B+,Midnight Lightning,Jimi Hendrix,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7002,"
With posthumous Hendrix it's best to concentrate on the improvisations as if he were a jazz musician, and heard this way Alan Douglas's second attempt at creative tampering beats the first. Once again the standouts are instrumentals--a Mitch Mitchell vamp called ""Beginnings"" and especially ""Trash Man,"" reminiscent of McLaughlin's Devotion only grander, more passionate, and more anarchic. Guitarist Jeff Mironov actually enriches that cut, just as guitarist Lance Quinn does ""Machine Gun,"" which due to the stiffness of the rhythm section is less funky than either live version but smashes through as a raveup. And beyond that the blues playing--as opposed to singing or writing--carries the album.
"
FALSE,B+,Nine to the Universe,Jimi Hendrix,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4950,"
With posthumous Hendrix it's always best to concentrate on the improvisations as if he were a jazz musician, and these relaxed jams are his jazziest contexts to date. Unfortunately, at least in theory, the only jazz player on hand is organist Larry Young, who got pretty far out with Miles and McLaughlin but sounds like Jimmy Smith over the Billy Cox-Mitch Mitchell beat. The result is bracing progressive r&amp;b with Jimi stretching out, and the question is whether tighter structures wouldn't have made him think harder and faster.
"
FALSE,B+,The Jimi Hendrix Concerts,Jimi Hendrix,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4951,"
Limited by Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell, never the world's greatest living rhythm section, this barrel-bottom houses Hendrix the heavy metal paterfamilias rather than Hendrix the nonpareil rock improviser (not that the two weren't sometimes the same). There've been more exciting versions of such highlights as ""Hear My Train a Comin'"" (on Rainbow Bridge), ""Little Wing,"" and especially ""Red House"" (both on the criminally deleted Hendrix in the West). But ""Are You Experienced"" has never been noisier.
"
FALSE,B+,Jimi at Monterey,Jimi Hendrix,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4952,"
Since I've oft been chastised for suggesting that the JHE's U.S. splashdown was less than extraterrestrial, I'm surprised at the yes-we-have-no-hosannas greeting this verbatim version. Maybe it's because only three of the ten tracks are previously unreleased. Maybe it's because after years of repackaging only suckers and acolytes get hot for another live Hendrix album. Or maybe it's because Jimi speeds alarmingly, Mitch Mitchell keeps tripping over his sticks, and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is patently hokey. Nevertheless, such extramusical factors as historical verisimilitude and tinless audio incline me to charity. Peace-and-love-and-egomania at its most far out.
"
FALSE,B+,BBC Sessions,Jimi Hendrix,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1699,"
An essential exhumation of the only rock artist I'm convinced merits them (I'll finish with the Springsteen box soon, honest). But despite the one-minute ""Sunshine of My Love"" and other oddments from his mercurial top-of-the-pops career, anyone who owns Rykodisc's one-CD 1988 version, off the market now that the good guys control the catalogue, has the essentials. There's a whiff of completism coming off the definitive Hendrix reissue program--the usual mix of profit maximization and hero worship, certain to separate the fans from the scholars pretty quick. The rationalization being, I guess, that six is nine--the fans are scholars already.

Charged with curbing Nona's insatiable desire to make rock records, Bill Laswell and Michael Beinhorn were abstemious enough not to make a Material record instead--just a slightly cerebral who-is-that-singing? funk record, with the cerebration mostly Nona's. As you might deduce, it could be smarter, but you can dance to it without losing your mind.

Makes sense that Henley's candid self-involvement should prove of more intrinsic interest than Glenn Frey's covert self-pity, but nobody capable of the distinction figured it would get as interesting as this. If there were anything to actually like about the guy, his complaints and revelations might even be moving. As it is, let's call them strong--like primo tequila, or the smell of an old jockstrap.

FALSE,B+,Somewhere on the Golden Coast,The Henry Clay People,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15401,"
Although their new EP sounds suspiciously like a reject pile, this talky 2010 tunefest showcases a six-years-running LA g-g-b-d who like Neil Young, Tom Petty, and especially the Replacements, the latter of whom they resemble but fall well short of matching, as goes without saying for the first two. Says chief songwriter Andy Siara: ""The situations I find myself are situations that a whole crapload of 20-somethings who don't know what they're doing are in as well."" Their gift is transforming these situations into songs that don't have quite the juice to inspire a movement, including songs with titles like ""Working Parttime"" and ""End of an Empire."" They named themselves after The Great Compromiser because they wanted something historical-political, adjudged the Forgotten Presidency of Chester A. Arthur too long for a marquee, and settled--too soon, as compromisers will. I think of them as the Displacements myself.

""We found some jobs and paid off our loans/Then we lost our jobs and let your parents know/That you'll be movin' home."" ""Every band we ever loved/Is selling out or breaking up/Finding out the limits of their reach."" ""Give it up and come on out/That stupid dream is over."" ""You are the property of privilege/Now you are learning how to live with it."" ""You wanna taste a taste of the tasteless/We can waste away with the wasted."" ""And I can move to the country/But that won't solve anything."" ""One mistake too many fights three nights/You pay for the rest of your life."" ""Friends are forgetting/We're getting too tired to try/Keeping up with each other/So we leave them behind."" ""Not that it ever made a difference/Back when we were innocent/Oh-oh-oh."" Pretty impressive. Problem? More than half the songs sound effectively the same. Rocking, absolutely. Tighter, too. Tuneful, in their way. But imagine the Replacements without Westerberg's hookfinder and you'll understand the limits of their reach.

This casually joyous solo debut by the former Greenbriar Boy gives in at times to such folky vices as mere flash, mere lyricism, and mere whimsy. But ""Fire Song,"" a casually joyous ditty about how his house burned down, and ""Brother Sam,"" unpresumptuous compassion for a returned Vietnam vet, should inspire Paul Simon to work real hard on the follow-up.

Maybe his transported singing honors George Jones and Jerry Lee Lewis along with Red Allen and Bill Monroe because his long experience in folkiedom taught him something new about authenticity. Or maybe it's just that he's not above sinning.
"
FALSE,B+,Slug Line,John Hiatt,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1778,"
This hard-working young pro may yet turn into an all-American Elvis C. He's focused his changeable voice up around the high end and straightened out his always impressive melodies, but he has a weakness for the shallow (if sincere) putdown, e.g.: ""You're too dumb to have a choice."" Or else he'd get chosen, do you think he means? Lene Lovich: should cover ""You're My Love Interest.""
"
FALSE,B+,Slow Turning,John Hiatt,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1784,"
Cut with his road band rather than a select cast of studio heavies, which probably took some pressure off a perpetual comer who turns the juice up too high when he gets nervous. Anyway, the high-grade country fodder--""Is Anybody There?"" to a woman who loves him, ""Georgia Rae"" to a newborn daughter, and so forth--goes down easier. And the mean stuff he's always been best at--a roving couple who shoot up an automatic teller for laundromat change, a roving couple who steal one of Elvis's Cadillacs, a guy who cheats the world just like his daddy did--has a properly rowdy edge.

FALSE,B+,Y'All Caught?: The Ones That Got Away 1979-1985,John Hiatt,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4960,"
""She Said the Same Things to Me"" and ""It Hasn't Happened Yet"" are winning answers to the wimmin question, and every time they come up I feel like I love this male chauvinist victim. But not so's I pull out Warming Up to the Ice Age or Two Bit Monsters. The rest of his greatest misses are catchy, clever, even compassionate when you listen hard. Three are from Riding With the King, which I did go find--and still prefer.
"
FALSE,B+,The Best of John Hiatt,John Hiatt,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1785,"
Master of a Nashville-Memphis fusion that is all of rock and roll to his own generation and totally cornball to the next, this Springsteen-writ-small has always yoked Grade A songwriting to Brand X singing, and by now it's clear the limitation is as much intellectual as physical. Almost every individual selection here connects, the wedding plea ""Have a Little Faith in Me"" no less than the bank-robbing saga ""Tennessee Plates."" But though one doesn't negate the other--life is long, and various--Hiatt's ever more skillful shows of soul can't make them cohere, because at bottom he has nothing to say. All things considered, he might have been better off with less voice, not more. Then he wouldn't have been tempted to juggle career options on that endless road. He'd have settled into the well-heeled life of a Music Row pro. Alan Jackson would record his songs.
"
FALSE,B+,Striking It Rich!,Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7010,"
This isn't as long on ambient whimsy as Where's the Money?, but that's OK--makes a less distracting showcase for an artist who's much better at writing songs than at contextualizing them. I count seven I'd be delighted to hear somebody cover, and it's fun to hear Hicks's own outfit go after them. Best contextualization: Maryann Price's interpretation of ""I'm an Old Cowhand.""
"
FALSE,B+,Crazy for Christmas,Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15543,"
Crazy because he's always been pleasantly nuts, but also because he's crazy not just as a result of but about Christmas, which as all Christmas fans know is a combination with a shot at making the holiday as full of good cheer as it's supposed to be. Scatting ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" as one retro strategy among many, Hicks lays out an ""Old Fashioned Christmas"" complete with ""Bethlehem scene on the lawn/And a picture of Rudolph in the john"" as the elves in ""Santa's Workshop"" paint millions of wooden boats and planes. Remember wood? This is a good-humored sixtysomething who wants to teach his grandkids the old-timey verities. Then he'll take a nap.

FALSE,B+,Family,Joe Higgs,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1731,"
In a chronically undifferentiated music, subtlety can be a curse, and though I've gotten to know every song here and have no trouble admiring most, I wish Higgs had rehired the musicians who backed Triumph three years ago. It's my guess--and with subtlety you have to guess some--that the likes of Chinna Smith, Wire Lindo, and Augustus Pablo made the difference between an acknowledged classic and an obscure near thing.
"
FALSE,B+,Music to Wake the Dead!,Hi-Life International,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4963,"
With Ghana's big-band dance style now regarded as overpolite in its country of origin, highlife's virtues are ripe for exploitation elsewhere--namely, London, where these expatriates perceived an opening and moved in. The melodies are so fetching they camouflage the overcasual vocals, but the three attempts to cash in on Zaire's big-band dance style don't kick home. Soukous isn't supposed to be polite.

FALSE,B+,I'm a Blues Man,Z.Z. Hill,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4964,"
The title boast is inauspicious. If Hill's 1981 Down Home turned into a phenomenal 450,000-sold-and-counting sleeper on mere stylistic integrity, then why didn't his 1982 The Rhythm and the Blues do almost as well? You guessed it--song quality went way down. But after the bad start it rebounds considerably here. Personal to Tommy Couch: is Jimmy Lewis ready for another album of his own, or is he a stay-at-home?
"
FALSE,B+,Jezebel,Justin Hines & the Dominoes,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7013,"
Homey lyrics (""Jah-jah will spank you"") and artful instrumental touches--I like the gentle calypso-styled horns and decorative guitar licks--may mean this is a great reggae album. But they may mean it's only a subtle one, and in such an understated genre subtlety risks extinction.
"
FALSE,B+,Stay Positive,The Hold Steady,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14156,"
Craig Finn's aim is leaner rock and deeper narrative--sharper hooks, heavier consequences. Formally, this is the only progress that makes sense for them, and sometimes they make it count. ""Stay Positive"" nails the travails of the aging rock band harder than ""Start Me Up"" because it's about fans, and ""Constructive Summer"" craftily confuses different ways to get hammered. Both grab hold from their opening riffs, too. But it's one thing to understand that you're too good for piano flourishes, another to find alternative means of roiling the collective gut every time.
"
FALSE,B+,If It Ain't One Thing . . .,Bill Holland & Rent's Due,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7016,"
Despite the decline of the genre, I still hear a lot of singer-songwriter records, most of which sound smoother than this--both Holland and his band lack polish in the vaguely jazzy style mature folkies fall into. They have plenty of bounce, though, and something about the tender yet skeptical common sense of Holland's lyrics suggests that he doesn't much care for smooth stuff anyway. Not that his raggedness is a plus. But if I were an a&amp;r man and heard some unknown put across songs as out-of-the-ordinary as ""This Fourth Year"" and ""Do the Mambo"" I'd say the hell with the cracked voice and sign him.
"
FALSE,B+,For the First Time Anywhere,Buddy Holly,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4968,"
If like me you were crying, waiting, hoping, or just wishing for new songs, dream on--other versions of the five originals and five covers are already familiar to owners of the six-disc Complete Buddy Holly import, most of whom bought this the week it was released. Those who've settled for 20 Golden Greats will greatly enjoy meeting the originals, especially since they sound much stronger in these recordings. And now here's wishing I could say the same for the covers--Holly rejected ""That's My Desire"" because it was a dog, and if the new ""Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"" is competitive with the one you know, the new ""Bo Diddley"" isn't.
"
FALSE,B+,Good Taste Is Timeless,Holy Modal Rounders,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1538,"
A sextet who put the communal principle into practice--five of them sing lead, four write. They celebrate meat (""Pork liver, lambies tongues, vienna sausage""), boobs (""They're big they're round they're all around""), and a bunch of farmers who danced till dawn one night in the spring of '65. They're not crazy about horoscopes, ""cute antics,"" or city wimmin who live with dogs. Except for the timeless reel of ""Spring of '65,"" their great moments are fast and relatively loud, probably because projecting soft and sweet isn't something any old communard can do. But their collective spirit is touched with poetry nonetheless.
"
FALSE,B+,Last Round,Holy Modal Rounders,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1540,"
In which Peter Stampfel and friends--including veteran Rounders Steve Weber and Robin Remailly, many Clamtones, and Antonia, composer of ""That Belly I Idolize"" and ""God, What Am I Doing Here"" (with ""Fucking Sailors in Chinatown"" yet to come)--prove that the counterculture still exists. Strange drug experiences are detailed, ooze is embraced, girls without underwear consume hoagies and juice. In short, Head Comix live.
"
FALSE,B+,Chimera EP,Homeboy Sandman,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15814,"
The beats on these six songs tend low and thrummy, less than catchy but they stick with you. The philosophical lyrics are braggier than usual, and in a touch I like, every damn one is reproduced on the cover of the vinyl version. First side, ""I Do Whatever I Want"" and especially ""Cops Get Scared of Me"" prove somewhat less than compelling. But the second begins with a a geopolitical analysis so much shrewder than the unpromising title ""Illuminati"" that the two excellent if lesser tracks that follow are, well, illuminated.
"
FALSE,B+,Kool Herc: Fertile Crescent,Homeboy Sandman,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16025,"
The guy who cashes ""checks for packs of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked"" is so skilled he risks being too smart for his own good--a little like Aesop Rock, except that a) he's not white and b) he's not an obscurantist. He wants to set his people on the right path and keeps thinking up explicit ways to say so. But none of them have gotten near that goal so far, not even theoretically, as they might if his skills included the ability to rise to actual hits, as opposed to pleasurable musicality, and also to sink to them. Not that that kind of skill comes any easier than the rhyming and rapping he's so good at. But I'm struck by my favorite song on this EP, ""Lonely People,"" in which a raggedy ""Eleanor Rigby"" refrain flexes against verses that begin: ""Look at all these wannabe famous people/All they talk about is famous people/Every statement be defaming people."" True enough, obviously. But it makes me wonder whether fame is really something he's willing to go for.
"
FALSE,B+,The Honest Cartwrights,The Honest Cartwrights,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4970,"
As craft enjoys its inevitable comeback, here are four guys who don't make it sound like a strain--over-thirties, I'll bet, big Steely Feat fans, only fresher because they've got something to prove, to themselves if no one else. And if you think alcoholism, masturbation, and nuclear war sound punky, tell me what punk band would cap their bomb song with a mournful ""There goes my career""?
"
FALSE,B+,Sweet Replies,Honey Cone,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7026,"
I know ""Want Ads"" is pure Jackson 5, but most of this is pure Vandellas. Producer-songwriter Ronald Dunbar must have had lots of advice from label owners Holland-Dozier-Holland--he uses every H-D-H trick and comes up with a few electronic effects of his own on this sturdy LP. Highlights: ""Are You Man Enough, Are You Strong Enough"" (to raise another man's child), ""The Day I Found Myself"" (was the day I left you).
"
FALSE,B+,Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance,Patterson Hood,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15772,"
Hood earned this avowedly autobiographical album by creating fictional and fictionalized characters for 20 years. Its dozen songs were conceived to bait a memoiristic account of a turbulent period or two in his twenties, but the book stopped coming midway through so he made an album out of them instead. Sweetly skeletal arrangements featuring various bandmates and his bassist dad underpin the quietest and most winning singing of his career, with lyrics so crystalline you never need the booklet. But you can bet their import would be clearer if the book was there too.
"
FALSE,B+,Stoneage Romeos,Hoodoo Gurus,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4972,"
""Tojo"" and ""Leilani"" and ""Zanzibar."" ""Death Ship"" and ""I Was a Kamikaze Pilot."" Hiccups from Lux Interior and counterpoint from the Pink Panther and attitudes from Mental as Anything and rhymes from Danny &amp; the Ramones. Those with no use for trivial pursuits can ignore this one, but if you enjoy the game when the fun isn't forced, these cheerfully maladjusted Aussies certainly beat what's been coming out of the bat-garages of L.A. and London these past two-three years. And if you want to read meaning and feeling into ""Arthur"" (who dies) or ""I Want You Back"" (which like ""My Girl"" isn't a cover) or even ""Zanzibar"" (a secret masterpiece, sez I), they--by which I mean the songs, not the band--won't spit in your eye.
"
FALSE,B+,Endless Boogie,John Lee Hooker,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11261,"
I like this double-lp more than either of two recent Bob Hite efforts. Hooker 'n' Heat (Liberty) features too much unaccompanied Hooker and tends to play on his status of a minor blues relic with hot-off-the-tape studio rapping, although the last side really boogies, as the saying goes. Coast to Coast Blues Band (United Artists) collects 14 20-year-old masters, mostly previously unreleased solo takes. The white audience hasn't much changed Hooker's sound, so the timeliness of Endless Boogie is an unmitigated plus, and producers Bill Szymczyk and Ed Michel get a relaxed groove out of a cast of supporting musicians (Brown, Miller, Davis, Radic, Naftalin) who can boogie Canned Heat right out of the studio.
"
FALSE,B+,The Healer,John Lee Hooker,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4975,"
Pushing 130 now, Hook will still walk anybody into the studio for cash up front. Though the pickings have been getting leaner, here anybody includes Carlos Santana, George Thorogood, Bonnie Raitt, Robert Cray, Canned Heat, and Los Lobos, most of whom commit crimes against his ageless essence that tone up the product considerably. And for the purist market, the product ends with four solo stomps.
"
FALSE,B+,Earth Song/Ocean Song,Mary Hopkin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7030,"
My taste for Hopkin's limpid prettiness may be eccentric, but there it is. She sings like the demure, starstruck adolescent she was until very recently, which lends her straightforward role-playing a revelatory poignancy lacking in the genteel atavism of the folkie madonnas she superficially resembles. Recommended: ""International.""
"
FALSE,B+,Cross Words,Larry Hosford,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7033,"
A funny country singer-songwriter with complicated emotions and an elusive, strangely ageless vocal persona--mellowed-out Homer and/or Jethro, perhaps, or comic-relief L.A. cowboy gone crackerbarrel, or crackers. His wife calls him Daddy, calls his bluff, and then just calls a cab, but don't worry--here's a man who don't worry--here's a man who knows that love gets easier when you own a blanket with a switch on it.
"
FALSE,B+,Cicero Park,Hot Chocolate,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1546,"
From the black-and-white London group that originated ""Brother Louie"" comes an album that might sound startling in retrospect and is impressive now. At the very least, its insightful confusions over class and race locate the honest roots of one kind of black conservatism. Both Mickie Most's precise, almost formal framing (pop hard rock veering toward disco) and the elocution of singer-composers Errol Brown (hard) and Tony Wilson (soft) make for an overall detachment unbroken by the passion of individual cuts. Strange to hear soul with a British accent.
"
FALSE,B+,Hot Chocolate,Hot Chocolate,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1547,"
Not quite as substantial as Cicero Park, but more startling, thanks to ""You Sexy Thing,"" the eccentrically wild-and-proper English-soul supersmash included hereupon.
"
FALSE,B+,Going Through the Motions,Hot Chocolate,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1551,"
For years I've resisted the idiot notion that this was a ""disco"" group because Errol Brown is black. So did the discos. The discos are still resisting. But I think this is the best disco parody since Silver Convention's Madhouse. Keynote: ""Mindless Boogie.""
"
FALSE,B+,Hot Tuna,Hot Tuna,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7035,"
Didn't figure I'd ever put on this country blues extrapolation by Jorma and Jack's Airplane spinoff while John Hurt and Gary Davis were at hand. But the shameful fact is that between the delicate guitar play and Jorma's unpretentious vocals and unexceptionable taste, I do.
"
FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Human League,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1564,"
I still don't believe humans bought these songs because they liked them. As the leader says, or intones, or even sings if you want to be polite: ""(Keep Feeling) [dig those parentheses] Fascination."" At their best, they're fascinating--masters of body-snatcher music, articulate simulated emotion fortified with the coldest hooks ever manufactured. Which is why their Jam-Lewis move was such a fraud. ""I'm only human/Of flesh and blood I'm made""--yeah, sure.
"
FALSE,B+,The Talk of the Town,Helen Humes,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1515,"
Humes's skill is manifest, but her aesthetic assumptions don't connect for me. The Afro-American forms from which rock and roll derived acknowledged their class (not race) origins, either directly (the plainspokenness of r&amp;b) or by outright avoidance (doowop's go-for-broke-fantasy). White kids may have identified with ghetto blacks out of the most abject simplemindedness, but they got candor (r&amp;b) or spiritual intensity (doowop) in the bargain. The adult nightclubbers for whom a jazz-blues stylist like Humes performed, on the other hand, related to the subtle twists of emotion implied by her intricate vocal inventions only because such intricacy takes for granted the protective veneer of culture, which is sophistication's bottom line. The hidden message of Humes's music is a ruling-class myth: that the most horrible suffering (catch the lyric of ""Good for Nothin' Joe"") is of manageable consequence. She denies the out-of-control. And I miss it.

FALSE,B+,Van Hunt,Van Hunt,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12335,"
""I love it when we make mistakes/Because once again it gives me a reason to complain,"" this not very Southern-fried ATL r&amp;b singer-songwriter-guitarist begins one song. After all, he's no love man: ""Words without hate/Would leave me nothing left to say."" In short, although Hunt's heaven-and-hell split may give his falsetto a devilish cast, it isn't just a fancy excuse for dogging around. It helps him think.  In ""Seconds of Pleasure,"" for instance, he finds a dozen meanings of life without mentioning sex once--even if an orgasm gave him the idea.
"
FALSE,B+,Long Journey,Michael Hurley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2368,"
Fingers trembling, the oft-cynical critic opened the new LP by the playful, sardonic folkie recluse. Without the Rounders or Jeffrey Fredericks to change paces, there was no way it could be another Have Moicy! (Aw.) But it might be woozy and charming, like Armchair Boogie. (Hey!) Or cute and dull, like Hi-Fi Snock Uptown. (Duh.) Also, the critic might fall asleep before finding out. Four months and many snoozes later, he arrived at a verdict: sardonic, charming, playful, cute, woozy, and only rarely dull. Highly recommended to Have Moicy! cultists. Hitbound: ""Hog of the Forsaken."" Whoopee.
"
FALSE,B+,Watertower,Michael Hurley,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2370,"
His core audience couldn't be much over 2000, and since I'm on its fringe, I don't much care that this typically unheralded, offhand, and tardy acoustic collection will make no converts. He still writes more calmly and curiously about the great beyond than anyone. What's more ""Broadcasting the Blues"" and ""I Paint a Design,"" break thematic ground--television and professionalism, respectively.
"
FALSE,B+,Land Speed Record,H����,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1566,"
Like a good Eno ambient, this raving nonstop live one provides just enough surface detail--recombinant noise guitar, voices tailing off like skyrockets, slogans such as ""data control,"" ""do the bee,"" and ""ultracore""--to function as mood rather than trance music, though admittedly not for the same kind of mood. Guaranteed to assuage the nervous tension of co-op conversion, labor strife, bad orgasm, World War III, and other modern urban annoyances. In other words: aarrghhh!

FALSE,B+,Slippin' and Slidin',J.B. Hutto & the New Hawks,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4989,"
Good new Chicago-style blues albums are rare occurrences that fall into two categories. On last year's, A.C. Reed enlivened an ordinary-plus groove with hilarious-minus material. On this year's, the now deceased slide guitar king makes his tightest and most raucous recorded music since 1968's definitive Hawk Squat! He gets telling (and tellingly understated) help from the Roomful of Blues horns. Telling-minus material would have helped even more.
"
FALSE,B+,House of Sleeping Beauties,Lucia Hwong,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2165,"
This intelligent if hyper-romantic new-age prestige item would make a nifty soundtrack for Lost Horizon and comes with the blessing of new-age titan (and sometimes soundtrack composer) Philip Glass, who identifies Hwong as one of those select young composers who are equally conversant with Eastern and Western music. Unfortunately, not many Western listeners will hear it as more than high-class chinoiserie--maybe those sopranos derive from Chinese opera, but they sound like Hollywood angels anyway. I trust the artist's decolletage derives from Chinese opera as well.
"
FALSE,B+,Power,Ice-T,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4990,"
I don't know about his role modeling: for anyone who thinks real men defy danger, dealing is obviously a surer and easier route to the gold than rapping. But he's got his own sound--flat, clipped, quick-lipped. And when he sticks to his subject, his narrative style is as gripping and understated as Islam's samples.
"
FALSE,B+,Home Invasion,Ice-T,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1594,"
At first it sounds as if the bad guys won--from sexy stories to o.g. kissoffs, he spends too much time proving he's still Ice Motherfucking T. But in fact he contextualizes himself as shrewdly as ever. He may write the misogynist rhymes--""I got an ill side that drips from my brain,"" he explains--but he leaves the worst to DJ Evil E and 2 Live Crew sicko Brother Marquis, the conceit being that some black men think women are hoes just like some black men wanna off cops, and that every one of these black men deserves to be heard. Which I buy, sort of, while noting that in the lead track a narrator posing as Ice-T offs a cop himself, and not for the last time. ""Addicted to Danger"" is a shrewd gangsta fable; ""99 Problems"" takes bitch-talk over the top where it belongs; Grip plays his Yo-Yo; the carefully phrased ""Race War"" and the self-aggrandizing ""Message to a Soldier"" and the amazing ""Gotta Lotta Love"" (is that a bridge?) are as politically felt as the greatest PE. But in a rapper as musically expedient as Ice-T, pro forma claims to hard prowess are rarely of much interest in themselves. Blame them on the bad guys.
"
FALSE,B+,Vital Idol,Billy Idol,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4996,"
In which the con artist who convinced the majors the EP was a profit-taker makes something of an even more useless and cost-effective marketing ploy, the remix. The more he pixilates his pseudosex with studio sensationalism--reverb, big beat, every synthesized redundancy know to applied science--the more closely he approaches his cartoon essence. Second side's just macho disco nevertheless, but the first side is macho disco at its . . . well, let's use a technical term here: hottest.

In which David Bowie remembers ""the world's forgotten boy"" long enough to sponsor an album--and mixes it down till it's thin as an epicure's wrist. The side-openers, ""Search and Destroy"" and ""Raw Power,"" voice the Iggy Pop ethos more insanely (and aggressively) than ""I Wanna Be Your Dog."" But despite James Williamson's guitar, the rest disperses in their wake.

Still wish there were some rudimentary verbality here, but the music has won me over--the title track is the most gorgeous reggae crooning I've ever heard, and the rest of the album follows in its sweet wake like one of those half-remembered dreams that makes you glow the next day.
"
FALSE,B+,Paris au Printemps,Image Publique S.A.,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5767,"
Supposedly let out of the pen to head a bootleg off at the specialty shops, this live album has a suitably cynical look, but mostly it just sharpens the drums and guitar of songs from 1978's flat and hasty First Issue, ""Public Image"" unfortunately not among them. It cuts deepest on the previously unrecorded (I think) ""Psalmodie,"" which could almost make you think John Lydon liked rock and roll.
"
FALSE,B+,Body Talk,Imagination,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5000,"
Possessed of a sweet, undemanding falsetto, not unlike those of second-string Miracle Billy Griffin and second-string Temptation Damon Harris, black Englishman Leee John knows better than to be expressionistic--this music is just as sweet and just as undemanding, anchored by simple keyboard hooks and drum patterns and never venturing beyond a croon in tempo, volume, or message. Even those entranced by his trio's current dance hit, ""Just an Illusion,"" might as well buy the album--the formula actually gathers charm over a whole side.
"
FALSE,B+,In the Heat of the Night,Imagination,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5001,"
Most English disco albums project the music into a chrome-plated video-game ""future""; this one conjoins it to a flesh-and-blood rock and roll ""past."" Sweeter and simpler--but no dumber--than their alienated-adolescent counterparts across the color line. Leee John and friends depict themselves on the cover as Flash Gordon-style gladiator-cosmonauts on an endless keyboard into space, but they're love men and almost soul men nevertheless, and one more hook as hypnotic as ""Just an Illusion""'s would have every android from here to Triton making out on the couch.

Way back in the 1960s I tried to figure out whether these acoustic Scots were magic or bullshit and concluded that they were both. But lately they've lost something.

Although they've never broken top twenty, this quartet has scored eight r&amp;b hits since 1972, four of them top ten and every one included on this efficient long player. The mode is post-Smokey with Claudette reinstated--three men and one woman who excel in the contained ""love"" vocal style, with Chuck Jackson adding his gift for recitative (a truly great ironic chuckle). I like the songs, too--but admit that they're not bright enough for pop.

Still deciding what to rap about on their debut, they deliver the eternal we're-good-rappers-so-listen-up with their already trademark matter-of-factness. To hammer their point home, they provide hooks in highly reliable fashion, two of the best attached to lyrics more lyrical than the titles ""Yo"" and ""Wow"" portend. On two successive six-minute closers, however, they either run out of ideas or mistake slowcore for a good one.

FALSE,B+,Palimpsesto,Inti-Illimani,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5008,"
Exiled in Italy since the 1972 coup, these Andean traditionalists from Chile have softened their conception just like so many other folk professionals--compare this to the austere 1971 Canto Para una Semilla. So it's not surprising that the lead cut here is an original composition that sounds like French soundtrack music played on exotic flutes and strings. What is surprising is that it makes you want to see the movie--and that except perhaps during ""Danza,"" the instrumental which opens side two, the group's romanticism is somewhat less winning when expressed more ""authentically.""

All Gregory Isaacs songs sound the same, but some of them sound more the same than others, and for a long time I was ready to relegate his best-distributed LP to the Land of Nod. Turns out there isn't a bad track on side one, though I don't guarantee any great ones. And don't forget side two.

Cumulatively, Isaacs's resourcefulness is very impressive--he almost always manages to vary his sad, soothing mid-tempo formula not just riddimically but with enduring bits of melody and observation. But because the formula is sometimes too soothing he needs more than bits to go over the top. Rastafarian marginal differentiation fans will love this record.

From ""Sacrifice,"" in which spirituality and even beauty itself follows inevitably from the comprehension of oppression, side one establishes the subtle power and grace of Isaacs' rather urban reggae, not least because it stops off at Billy Vera &amp; Judy Clay's ""Storybook Children.""

At least once the great lover takes his formulaic bent too far--""Private Secretary"" is a remake of the sex fantasy ""Night Nurse"" in which he plays a boss instead of a patient, no advance. And on ""Sheila"" and elsewhere the melodies are banal rather than simple. But the rest of the time they're not only simple, but less simple than they seem, enhanced as usual by the Roots Radics' profound angularity and Isaacs's smooth concentration and subtle hooks.

After sinking into ever more unctuous hits-plus-filler formula for most of the decade, JA's love king hied to producer Gussie Clarke, who put contract songwriter Carleton Hines on the case. Despite some icky moments, notably a duet about feeling irie, the move is for the good: there's a light touch to this music--Isaacs whispering and murmuring around diffident horn-section filigrees--that I'd call sexy. Maybe even irie, who knows.

Still, with ""That Lady"" their most original original in years, Ernie soaring around thrillingly on his magic guitar, and the others popping their various things in ever more winning combinations, this is their sexiest music in years. Just because they manhandled ""Fire and Rain"" doesn't mean they can't improve on James's schlock. In fact, between their sense of rhythm and their knee-jerk sincerity they make all three covers work--except for the mental jasmine part, of course.

The Isleys are one of the great music-business success stories--in a decade when the artists were supposed to take over the industry, they're one of the few (along with Jefferson Lear Jet) to make a go of their own label. But though T-Neck puts out excellent product, product is all it is. This two-LP compilation, in which their Buddah-distributed material reverts to the Isleys' company (it's virtually identical to Buddah's 1976 The Best . . . package), reminds us that even back when they were inventing their shtick they were also victims of it. The only great songs are ""It's Your Thing"" and ""Work to Do""; they reuse the same harmonies and dynamics again and again. The Isleys to own, probably--but there's no doubt you can live without it.

Cut around 1965, while Hendrix was still part of the Isley's band, these casual sessions, remixed to push his guitar up with the voices, are far superior to Curtis Knight's Hendrix tapes. Make you wonder what would have happened if they'd been released at the time. Especially on ""Move Over Let Me Dance,"" Hendrix anticipates effects Clapton introduced on ""Sunshine of My Love,"" but in a less inflated context--could have blown some minds in Harlem. Not all of the music is don't-miss great. But it's all historic--and you can dance to it.

FALSE,B+,Snow Job,Jack Frost,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1621,"
It's 1993. Grant McLennan of the much-mourned Go-Betweens meets Steve Kilbey of the barely-missed Church for a second one-off, written and recorded on the spot and then stuck in a box until they find time to finalize it, which takes years. The songs evoke romantic moods and vague experiences rather than nailing the literal-cum-ineffable; the music strives for effect rather than detail or even ambience. By McLennan's standards, it's hokey, mysterioso, fulla keybs. Yet its schlock disposability and glam brio generate the crass charm McLennan's class act too often avoids. Too bad only cultists will care--and worse still that they'll probably reject it on principle.

Jackson is a fifty-six-year-old gravedigger who's been on the folk blues circuit since 1964 and has three albums on Arhoolie, though I'd never heard of him till this one. His guitar style is eclectic, as befits a man who got his best songs from Blind Boy Fuller and Blind Blake 78s but who also played in a country band in the early '40s. His voice is gutteral yet well-defined. No innovator, and not as arresting through a whole side as he is at the outset, he's nevertheless responsible for the most pleasing (and well-recorded) new country blues record I've heard in years.

In part because deciding that Jesus wasn't my savior was the toughest intellectual work of my life, I'm not much of a gospel fan, and that goes double for the kind of stately midtempo message singers I avoid in every genre--I don't even really get Aretha Franklin's Amazing Grace, hailed as her very peak by many nonbelievers with their fingers crossed. Nonetheless, this is Mahalia Jackson, and I've tried, Lord, I've tried--particularly by buying her early stuff, from before Columbia turned her into what the indefatigable gospel scholar Anthony Heilbut once called ""a black Kate Smith."" But this career-spanning, Heilbut-compiled selection of live rarities reached me as my earlier tries hadn't, so with other Mahalia versions of half its songs already in my iTunes, I compared and contrasted. Heilbut's finds won every time. At their very best--""Keep Your Hand on the Plow,"" ""Didn't It Rain,"" the storytelling ""Jesus Met the Woman at the Well""--they rock and roll with such grace I shout about it. Often they remind me that the piano is a percussion instrument. And at the very least they're more relaxed. Yet in the end, there's still a bunch of stately message singing here.

Once you get past the slipshod cynicism of Motown's catalogue exploitation, you have to admit that this mostly remixed, sometimes synthed-up mishmash has its charms and even uses--that in fact it's superior to the ""real"" 1975 best-of the label long ago deleted. I love the previously unreleased ""Twenty-Five Miles"" and the preteen-sings-the-blues ""Doggin' Around,"" could live without the two J5 nonhits, and will no doubt pull this down when I want to remember ""Dancing Machine"" and ""Rockin' Robin.""

Anybody who charges studio hackery is too narrow-minded to be able to hear pros out-doing themselves. Studio mastery is more like it, the strongest and most consistent black pop album in years, defining Jam &amp; Lewis's revamp of Baby Sis as the mainstream and then inundating it in rhythmic and vocal power. But what made Thriller a miracle wasn't consistency--it was genius like ""Beat It"" and ""Billie Jean"" and the unknowable allure of the pure star. The closest thing to genius here is the CD-only ""Leave Me Alone,"" which isn't all that close and also suggests what's happened to his allure--the more knowable he gets, the more fucked up he seems. This is a record that damn near wrecks perfectly good dancin' and singin' with subtext. He's against burglary, speeding, and sex (""Dirty Diana"" is as misogynistic as any piece of metal suck-my-cock), in favor of harmonic convergence and changing the world by changing the man in the mirror. His ideal African comes from Liberia. And he claims moonwalking makes him a righteous brother. Like shit.

Producer Raeford Gerald's ""My Man, a Sweet Man"" and ""I Miss You Baby"" are as melodically upbeat as Jackson's own ""Ask Me What You Want,"" and she delivers a ghetto sermon so unfashionably judgmental it makes me want to shout amen just to be contrary. But most of the rest is so nondescript that even Jackson's big, rough, tremendously vital voice can't bring it to life. Marginal.

Jackson's specialty--the funky truth about husbands, wives, and other women--is worth this sequel. As with Caught Up, she has her theme in control about eighty percent of the time, and her tone has become even nastier. But since she no longer has the advantage of surprise, her stridency is beginning to seem a little forced.

The songs aren't getting any stronger, bad news for a concept artist who's slowly running out of concept. But ""Feel Like Making Love"" (Bad Company's, not Roberta Flack's--score one for Millie), ""A House for Sale,"" and Clarence Reid's super-funky ""Do What Makes the World Go Round"" combine with a terrific dramatic monologue about scoring at a party and a tour de force demonstration of sexual noises to push this one over the line.

As a convinced monogamist, I've always approved of Millie's no-shit shtick--there's a lot more commitment to love and marriage in her acerbic skepticism-going-on-cynicism than in the old escapist fantasies or the new therapeutic bromides. Still, shtick does wear out, so I'm happy to report that ""Why Say You're Sorry"" is her sharpest lyric in years and ""Logs and Thangs"" her funkiest monologue. Also, the title tune has a line about bosses that should raise class consciousness a notch.

FALSE,B+,A Moment's Pleasure,Millie Jackson,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7087,"
If only because it's so patently unlikely to result in dancefloor hits, the arrant discofication is annoying at first--these songs don't need David Van De Pitte's clamorous strings and horns or bass lines that pine for a kick-drum. But Brandye's back-ups add extra nuance to Jackson's ever subtler singing, and Clayton Ivy's guitar obbligatos insure a flow her declamatory approach often lacks. What's more, the disco touches lend Millie's bawdy moralism special relevance to the latest arena of modern hedonism. If only her lyric on ""Seeing You Again"" didn't sound like an ad for Eastern Airlines I'd be convinced she was above gross hedonism herself.

Because her dirty mouth is more purely a shock effect than most pop concepts, it's sure to lose its zing for the audience even if Millie stays interested, which according to her last few studio albums she hasn't. But this one-volume follow-up to 1979's live double is also a de facto best-of, claiming the pop classic ""This Is It"" from Kenny Loggins and the pop throwaway ""Passion"" from Rod Stewart as well as preserving for posterity at least one rap that makes me squirm, and I don't squirm easy.

The title is misleading--this meeting of the bullshitters is more groove than rap. Not that it's devoid of spoken vamps or pointed byplay--the joyful havoc they wreak on ""Do You Wanna Make Love"" transforms it from pap to aphrodisiac. But mostly it gives Millie a chance to get out of her bag and really sing, with Isaac playing the likable foil and the Muscle Shoals boys making it sexy.

Believing correctly that what distinguishes Jackson's harmolodic fusion from Coleman's and Ulmer's isn't less musicality so much as no fun, Bill Laswell persuades him to beef up the themes and steady the beat. The upshot is the swinging ""Software Shuffle"" and other stuff. But it's also a record that tends to blare like regular old fusion, and it's not fun enough.

There may be drummers who can cut Jackson, but nobody else moves so fluidly from free time to on-the-one. I only wish he'd indulge himself with a drummer's record. The music is never less than dense and jumpy, and he's keeping things compact--eleven cuts total. But handing your themes over to (guitarist) Bern Nix and (violinist) Billy Bang is no way to show off your composing. Stanley Crouch has a word for this kind of thing: eso, as in esoteric. Pretty good eso, sure. But even in my head I don't dance to it.

Admittedly, the charm of hearing an eleven-year-old cover Smokey, Stevie, and the Delfonics may not be enduring.

My friend who goes to discos tells me the Jacksons are the first major artists to put out a real disco album--designed for dancers, and listeners be damned. This may well be true--certainly the guitars and electric keyboards are more noteworthy than the singing. He also tells me it's the Jacksons' best album since who knows when, and what's surprising is that he's right again. This is a tribute to the aforementioned instruments, but the singing is fine, and if a lot of the songs live up to the album title, that ain't necessarily bad. For listeners (dancers too): ""What You Don't Know.""

FALSE,B+,Anthology,Jackson 5,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7074,"
The only one of Motown's triple-LP retrospectives to concentrate on (or even include much) '70s music documents an institution in decline. Initially, the company marshalls everything it's got for one final push--not for nothing was the group's songwriting-production combine called The Corporation, and it's a measure of their seriousness that they asked the Crusaders to help with the tracks. But within two years they'd run out of gas--all the mini-comebacks after that, even the dancing-machine coup, were flukes. The proof is that the old-formula filler often surpasses the desperate imitations that became minor hits--better ""E-Ne-Me-Ne-Mi-Ne-Moe"" than ""Skywriter"" or ""A Little Bit of You."" The selection includes Michael's hits, Jermaine's hit, the works, and as the other albums disappear it will become essential in its way. But not to listen to, much.

Victim of a truly perverse heightened expectation syndrome, this expert pop record is certainly in a league with Destiny and Triumph, now remembered as unjustly ignored black-music milestones by many of those who unjustly ignored them. What it lacks is Michael at the pitch of gulping syncopation we've learned to love so well, although I do think his two turns suffer the worst backlash of all--better a Stones throwaway than a Wings throwaway, and better the high-strung delicacy of ""Be Not Always"" than the mundane sensitivity of, say, ""If You're Ever in My Arms Again."" As for the Other Bros., this showcases them more vividly than the tour of the same name--there can never be too many crafty tunes about wanting a body or saving the world.

The naive, out-of-the-mouths-of-careerists clumsiness is endearing partly because it gets at truths too obvious to interest the sophisticated; the assumption that the word modern has sociopolitical import, for instance, is laughably autodidactic at one level and yet not without resonance when pounded out over and over. Would that the pounding were a little more flexible--this might rock as invitingly as their first if only it were varied with some appropriate covers. How about ""Kicks""?

Likable lads, as always, and improving themselves, too. The music has gained density and power, and they do OK with the social commentary--nice to see some empathy for doomed middle-class plodders like ""Smithers-Jones"" instead of the usual contempt, and ""The Eton Rifles"" and ""Little Boy Soldiers"" place them firmly on the left. On the other hand, some of this is pretty dumb (""Wasteland,"" ugh), and overarrangement (not so much extra instruments as dramatic vocal shifts) is no way to disguise thin melody.

They never got past second base here for the same reason cricket didn't. What's made Paul Weller such a hero in England is his Englishness--ever since he outgrew the pure punk urbanism of In the City, his closely observed lyrics have worked to reflect a national culture exactly as universal as dozens of others. Given his charming but nonetheless limiting musical limitations, he's no more a world musician than Winston Rodney or Sunny Ad������������������, and probably less. Because he doesn't share a gift for the riff with his mod hero Pete Townshend, even his hits get across more on tension and tenderness than on such body-balms as melody or his proudly proferred beat. This is where you'll find the hits, and where to begin. If he hits you where you live, or where you wished you live, All Mod Cons is the "

Kittenish one moment and cathouse the next, James offers disappointingly subtle pleasures for such a big singer--except for two ASCAP standards, the title song is the only one I'd care to hear from someone else, and not even James's foxy delight in her own moods can salvage some of them. Nor will the orchestrations--conventional in blues, soul, and big-band modes--draw anyone in. But these days only Tina Turner (who couldn't provide subtle pleasures if she wanted to) seems to get much of a kick out of the down and dirty, and James's uninhibited sense of humor and fondness for sexual combat finally jollies this album over the line.

Unbeknownst to white people, she was Soul Sister Number Two--more and better top-20 r&amp;b back when than Dionne Warwick, Martha Reeves, Tina Turner, Carla Thomas, Irma Thomas, any black woman besides Soul Sister Number One and Diana Ross, who belongs to pop. She's been a cult heroine since around the time she kicked heroin in 1974--albums with Wexler and Toussaint, tour with the Stones, etc. But her many post-'60s recordings have disappointed: often out of touch with herself (didn't kick alcohol till much later), she could coast on savvy and a fabulously down-and-dirty voice. So I expected not much from what turns out to be her best album since she met Barry Beckett at the Tell Mama sessions in 1968. Part of the difference is Beckett, the producer who's constructed the solidest bottom and sharpest top of her career, but mostly it's the something extra she invests in these half-remembered Memphis-type standards. Not all the way there--all the way there is hard after 35 years in the biz. But not cult-only either.

Produced by the well-bred rhythm section of drummer Donto James and bassist Sametto James, this is half riskily irreverent rock and roll and half perilously imperious blues. Beyond an inconclusive Creedence cover, she co-owns every non-blues--""Miss You""! ""Gotta Serve Somebody""! ""Try a Little Tenderness""! Otis's chortling ""Hawg for Ya""! Al's unremembered ""Rhymes""! ""Hound Dog,"" which counts aab or not! But neither the horns nor the B.B. homages will inspire the dutiful bluesboy to return to his long-abandoned O.V. Wright and Little Milton studies. From Big Mama Thornton to Shemekia Copeland, no woman has sung such material with more power. So maybe power isn't what it needs. Maybe it needs more irreverence.

James is such a pro I'm sure he didn't even want to top Street Songs. Might give his fans the wrong idea, and soon he'd actually have to work. So there's nothing as visionary as ""Give It to Me Baby"" or the epochal ""Super Freak"" here, and no protest numbers either. But all of the fast ones are such bad fun. Stealing his licks from G. Clinton &amp; Co. (or maybe himself, who cares anymore?), he's the nearest thing to a pop musician in the rock and roll sense that today's black charts--not to mention today's white charts--can offer. And in that great tradition he should never sing a ballad again.

Mandinka folk music reconceived by Mory Kante's multi-instrumentalist brother, whose emotional tenor soars over interwoven balafon (a big, deeply resonant xylophone) and kora (an intricately harplike guitar), with his guitar talking underneath and harmonies from women surnamed Diabate and Keita adding commentary and color. In Guinea, it's reconceived Mandinka folk music; in the U.S. it's world beat as world music, exotically pleasurable education for the ears.

FALSE,B+,Magna Carta Holy Grail,Jay-Z,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16072,"
After too many plays, this holding action won me over. Deeper than catchy, Timbaland's music is the precondition on an album that pits Basquiat against Blue--black man as artistic rebel versus black man as family stalwart. But the breakthrough only came when I started grinning every time I heard him advise his daughter regarding the Basquiat in his kitchen: ""Lean on the shit, Blue, you own it."" And though later he swears, ""I love my niggas more than my own blood,"" nowhere is black more beautiful than in the person of his own wife: ""Sleep every night with Mona Lisa/The modern version with better features."" In short, family wins both times. Give it up to the one where Beyonce pledges gangsta devotion and, best of all, the one where the would-be billionaire looks back at the betrayals of his own departed head of family with something that feels like dread.

FALSE,B+,Surrealistic Pillow,Jefferson Airplane,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10992,"
I dismissed this as ""amplified Peter, Paul &amp; Mary"" in the first piece of rock criticism I ever wrote; later, under the influence of ""Somebody to Love,"" a few powerful Jorma Kaukonen riffs, my ex-folkie girlfriend, and the prevalent cultural vibes, I recanted--in print, yet. Now I think I was closer the first time. There's good stuff here, but Spencer Dryden plays the drums as if trying out for the Riders of the Purple Sage, the sarcasm is as vapid as the optimism, and the folk-pretty melodies simply do not carry lyrics like ""When I see a girl like that/It brightens up my day.""
"
FALSE,B+,The Worst of Jefferson Airplane,Jefferson Airplane,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1680,"
For someone who enjoys their albums, like me, this factitious compilation--fifteen cuts is a lot, but though it includes all (two) of their AM smashes it doesn't even pretend to be a singles anthology--is a waste. But for someone who finds their albums wanting, like me, it has its uses, especially as overview. These folks are literate both verbally and musically. Their chops don't quite equal their tastes--""White Rabbit,"" with its bolero build and librarian's-eye view of lysergic acid, is perfect, but ""Chushingura"" is almost as sloppy in the picking as ""Today"" is in the sentiment. They were hippies when becoming a hippie took beatnik initiative and psychedelic imagination. And when they're good they make the for-better-or-worse evolution of rock and roll into rock seem both appropriate and inevitable.

FALSE,B+,Garland Jeffreys,Garland Jeffreys,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1334,"
A classy singer-songwriter with staying power; a classless singer-songwriter with at least two bags of tricks. ""Black and white as can be"" right down to his vocals, he's a living breathing advertisement for the mongrelization of the races, and it's his existential dilemma that permits Michael Cuscuna a gourmet coproduction in which Stonesy blues shuffles rub elbows with reggae from Kingston and a song about the zoo that makes Paul Simon sound like Marlin Perkins. Is he streetwise? Damn right--wise enough to find the streets a little scary.
"
FALSE,B+,Escape Artist,Garland Jeffreys,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5069,"
After four years of having been, Jeffreys makes like a macher. With Roy Bittan playing the colorist, Garland's affinities with Uncle Bruce are suddenly obvious, and with Big Youth and Linton Kwesi Johnson on counterpoint his reggae ties have never been firmer. ""Modern Lovers,"" his basic theme, is one he knows more intimately than, let us say, Hall &amp; Oates, but my two faves break the mood: ""Jump Jump,"" his greatest name-dropping song and an anthem for rock critics everywhere, and ""Miami Beach,"" Dennis Bovell-produced American dub that's too strong musically and politically to relegate to a bonus EP. Jeffrey's weakness for doggerel sticks out when he's writing this well, and the Springsteen connection reminds me that Ghost Writer's static rhythms cut into its durability. But this man should be given the keys to every city whose streets he walks--ours first.

FALSE,B+,Break It Up,Jemina Pearl,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14753,"
""Wave goodbye with a middle finger,"" the ex-Nashville ex-teenpunk advises bands on the run and singers who pack off to Brooklyn after the other guys break it up. Though the young are sure to discern ""maturity"" in her primal albeit produced solo debut, the rest of us will wonder how she'll adjust to the limitations of astrology, nervous system blues, ""I Hate People"" featuring Mr. Iggy Pop, and the theatrical hissy fit. The reason we care is that she retains her spunk, tunes, and way with a phrase. And not only is she talented, she's really cute.

FALSE,B+,Waylon and Willie,Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7119,"
Commercially, this collaboration was a sure shot. They could have hammed it up or run through on automatic; they could even have avoided connecting altogether. But as it happens, this is the strongest album either has made in a while, as full of enthusiasm and devoid of posturing as a dressing-room singout. As in most dressing-room singouts, though, things get a little too loose at times--sometimes it's hard to tell whether they remember the words.

""I'm going to the darklands/To talk in rhyme/With my chaotic soul."" Right--they know damn well their putatively erotic-existential despair speaks to thrill-seeking normals by making chaos rhyme. Seems inevitable for them to take their folk-simple hook-ditties in an acoustic direction, too. Yet as a normal I miss the feedback--without all that chaos, the trick just doesn't come off death-defying enough.

FALSE,B+,I Love Rock 'n' Roll,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1714,"
Covering the Dave Clark Five and ""Little Drummer Boy"" on the same side is a great schlock yea-saying move, but a move is all it is--makes me want to hear the originals rather than play the side again. Maybe if I knew the real ""Nag"" I'd feel the same about that. As it is, ""Nag"" has a spark that's lacking in all of Jett's originals except the complementary ""You're Too Possessive."" And I love rock 'n roll for its spark.

It's one of Jett's virtues that unlike so many rock traditionalists she doesn't let her sense of humor undercut her commitment--""Fake Friends"" (cf. ""Back Stabbers"") and ""The French Song"" (cf. ""Triad"") are the real stuff. It's also one of her virtues that unlike so many other rock traditionalists she does have a sense of humor. Even makes fun of the Stones--they called ""Starfucker"" ""Star Star,"" she covers it as ""Star Star"" (cassette-only until retailers pressured MCA into taking it off, still available as twelve-inch B-side), then dubs her own ""Scumbag"" ""Coney Island Whitefish."" And if you don't see what's so funny about her tuneless ""Everyday People"" (the twelve-inch in question), I guarantee Sylvester Stewart is laughing all the way to his next label. No joke: her nagging love-is-pain clich��"
FALSE,B+,Glorious Results of a Misspent Youth,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1715,"
Seekers after the unvarnished rock and roll truth needn't haunt used record stores and postbohemian beer joints--here it is in all its generic glory, with an independent woman on top providing a preideological political kicker. The problem for those of us who still care about ""art"" is that it's all a little too generic--in 1984 they may be better than the Stones, but they'll never be as good. I don't miss Mick--if Joan's lyrics are rarely clever, they're always pithy, and these days she's the smarter singer--but I do miss Keith, some musician whose writing/playing might make the songs sound like models rather than examples of the genre.
"
FALSE,B+,Good Music,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5073,"
The title signifies something cruder than coverees Hendrix, Richman, and Beach Boys, who aren't likely to show up on WNCN or WPAT themselves, and its moral certitude is what you have to love about her. She's a bit simple, our Joan, but so undoubting she can get away with transporting Route 128 to the West Side Highway. And even though only three or so of these selections--""Good Music,"" ""Black Leather,"" maybe ""Just Lust"" or ""This Means War,"" none of the covers--will be on her song list in 1990, it's heartening to know she'll be there in 1990, and that she'll sound like she did in 1982.

FALSE,B+,Up Your Alley,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1716,"
Jesus I wish she was just a little bit better than she actually is, and by closing side one with the cover exacta ""Tulane"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog,"" she comes this close to convincing me she's made the leap. But though nobody else male or female puts out such a reliable brand of hard rock, lean and mean and pretension-free, and though being female gives her an edge in a quintessentially male subgenre, not since her start-up has she made something special of her populist instincts. It's almost as if that's the idea.
"
FALSE,B+,Arriba El Norte,Flaco Jiminez,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5074,"
Comparison to Santiago Jr.'s more generic-sounding Familia y Tradicion leaves no doubt as to why Flaco has been the hep Chicano box-squeezer since Doug Sahm brought him to New York in 1972. For this brother, traditionalism doesn't mean straight and square--he's sprightly and flexible, ""pop"" only because he's not allergic to change. And this 1969-1980 compilation from his San Antonio label, complete with translations and knowledgeable notes, ought to be the Flaco for me. But though a similar collection by his rock-oriented compadre Steve Jordan did the trick, I find that I'm still on the outside after ten plays, which ought to be enough. I'm a New Yorker who doesn't know Spanish, and folk music isn't my thing. Until something changes, so be it.
"
FALSE,B+,An Innocent Man,Billy Joel,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5078,"
His art album having gone platinum and failed to clear bottom line, Joel comes at his poor neglected generation direct, peddling a nostalgia no one will mistake for philosophy. And although he's still a wordy bastard who can't leave a simple piece of music alone, the pre-Beatle ""concept""--unmistakable references to the Four Seasons and Otis Redding (as if Otis entered Billy's world before the Beatles, but never mind) marking a selfconsciously simplified musical orientation--does rein in his showbiz ornateness. A good half of these songs have the timeless melodic appeal of the greatest pop (the greatest pre-rock pop, but never mind)--the chorus he stole from ""L. v. Beethoven"" is by no means the most pleasing thing here. And though his Stax horns are way too ornate, that doesn't mean they're no fun.
"
FALSE,B+,In Style,David Johansen,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7128,"
Johansen is equal to his more soulish musical concept--no ""disco,"" just slower tempos, subtle be-yoo-ty, and some reggae--but he doesn't have the chops to get on top of it, and while this is solid stuff, the best of it tends to thin out a little. Although the problem isn't how often you think ""that's bad"" but how often you don't think ""that's great,"" the record is summed up for me by ""Big City,"" the most banal lyric he's ever written. Until now, you see, he'd never written any banal lyrics at all. Now he's got three or four.
"
FALSE,B+,Caribou,Elton John,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7133,"
I give up. Of course he's a machine, but haven't you ever loved a machine so much it took on its own personality? I was reminded of my first car, a '50 Plymouth. Then I decided Elton was more like a brand-new Impala I once rented on a magazine's money. Then I remembered that I ended up paying for that car myself. Yes, I hate the way he says ""don't diszgard me"" too, but ""The Bitch Is Back"" is my most favorite song.
"
FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Elton John,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7134,"
I don't agree that singles are Elton's metier--his method is too hit-or-miss to permit such a surefire formula, and some of his best stuff (""Your Sister Can't Twist,"" ""Solar Prestige a Gammon"") has proven too wild or weird for a&amp;r/p.d. consciousness. There are no clinkers here, and I suppose if you only want one of his albums this is it. But it's stylistically ragged, two of its four great cuts are also on Honky Chateau, and I'd just as soon hear the first side of Caribou.
"
FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits Volume II,Elton John,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7138,"
The two previously-unavailable-on-LP originals here are peaks, but the two covers are dippy. Plus the lead cut from Caribou and two hits from Rock of the Westies and leftovers from 1971 and 1976 and the climax of Captain Fantastic. Is this product necessary? Depends on who's doing the needing.
"
FALSE,B+,Johnson's Whacks,The Jimmy Johnson Band,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7141,"
Syl's cousin performed better on Alligator's Living Chicago Blues Volume I, but only marginally, and he compensates by showing unexpected chops as a writer. Whether hoping to make the cover of Living Blues magazine or complaining that women aren't loyal any more, he comes across as a bold-faced contemporary. But his basic wail starts to sound thin after a while, his band is only solid, and his guitar can't carry the extra load.
"
FALSE,B+,Bass Culture,Linton Kwesi Johnson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2064,"
As if to dispel suspicions that he's an interloper, the poet emphasizes music--sometimes dubwise, sometimes jazzy, with guitarist John Kpiaye cutting the difference in a satisfying show of state-of-the-art support. But Johnson's command of the tonalities and rhythms of Jamaican English is the most musical thing about an artist whose musicality isn't in question, and the more room he gives his players, the less that leaves him.
"
FALSE,B+,Total Explosion,Syl Johnson,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7144,"
Johnson has tended to disappear in between Willie Mitchell and Al Green, but on this LP he takes his harmonica up to the microphone and stands clear as a lapsed bluesman. Good move. His voice is still shriller, and more strained than Green's, but that can be a satisfying distinction in the right context. A comparison of his unexceptionably dynamic rendition of ""Take Me to the River"" to Green's sublime original, however, renews one's understanding of what divine spark might be. Although I wish the folks at Hi would let him sing just one Junior Wells song, say, they've done him proud.
"
FALSE,B+,Ms. Fine Brown Frame,Syl Johnson,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5090,"
Johnson has the rep and pedigree of a down-home treasure, but like so many of his fellow workers both renowned (Johnnie Taylor) and obscure (O.V. Wright), he's rarely better than his material if almost never worse. Having released bluesy soul records out of sweet home Chicago since the dissolution of his '70s label, where his final album was a dismal piece of out-of-it disco, Johnson here constructs his best collection since 1975's Total Explosion and his best side ever on the firm foundation of the title track, a superb piece of out-of-it disco. And may well have something equally interesting to show us in another seven years.
"
FALSE,B+,Essential Blues Masters,Tommy Johnson,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15723,"
This Johnson is a Delta legend best appreciated by blues aesthetes like the late great Robert Palmer--who hears, for instance, ""a slippery, danceable swing"" in guitar accompaniments others account regionally generic. Johnson messed with your woman, drank Sterno for breakfast, and claimed meetings at the crossroads with you-know-who. But he only recorded for two years of his 1896-1956 lifespan. Like most collections available, this one preserves 17 tracks and 13 songs, five of which I have now removed from my iPod for reasons of distressed audio, compositional shortfall, or (usually) both. I've also banished three alternate versions, although I kept both scratchy ""Black Mare Blues"" just to hear New Orleans's Nehi Boys kick in their piano and clarinet, which do Johnson a lot more good than you-know-who. As I hear it, he has two drop-dead classics in his kit: the indelible ""Big Road Blues"" and the clarion ""Cool Drink of Water Blues."" The frailing ""Maggie Campbell Blues"" and the confessional ""Canned Heat Blues"" are close behind, and the rowdy-to-miserable likes of ""Big Fat Mamma Blues"" and ""Lonesome Home Blues"" fill in the blanks. I saved serious bucks by purchasing this iteration as a download. It also includes a posthumously electrified band version of ""Canned Heat Blues"" designated ""an abomination"" by the one blues aesthete on the interweb to acknowledge its existence. Personally, I welcome it as a hint of what might have been.
"
FALSE,B+,Neon Repairman,Freedy Johnston,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16555,"
His best collection of songs in this century--clever in the service of a pensive compassion, the major exception being the guy who just kept driving when the cops caught up with that crazy gal Angeline. Feel the unadorned forlorn of ""Baby, Baby Come Home."" Hear how thin-shoed and pregnant outgrows her ""Summer Clothes."" Meet the veteran who didn't get blown up with his buddies but will you sign for this please because he left his hands back in that gutter. Not many dynamics--Can You Fly? is funky by comparison. But a lot of feeling and enough tune.

It does tend schlocky, like so much of what Peter Gabriel's world music label puts out. Yet as someone with no use for Martin Denny or Jean Michel Jarr������������������ or for that matter Junoon, I get undifferentiated pleasure from this two-disc best-of by Haroon and Farook Shamsher, Indian-Bangladeshi brothers who came of age mastering '80s sampling and beatmaking skills in their flautist father's East End instrument shop. The Orientalisms they mix in are fresh enough to engage not just gullible U.K. ravers but an openminded outsider like yours truly; their trance grooves don't go for that overbearing Ibiza-style attack. Try t""We Need Your Vote"" segueing into the hyperactive tablas, reassuring sitars, and female ululations of ""My Love."" Not everything here is up to that standard. But it's a fair taste.

FALSE,B+,Jo Jo Gunne,Jo Jo Gunne,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11719,"
A hard rock band that digs structure and texture as well as drumming and amplification. Vaguely reminiscent of Layla and Detroit, this also derives from the best of Spirit--namely, ""I've Got a Line on You."" Hi-high, American pie.

FALSE,B+,Pop 'N' Mento,The Jolly Boys,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5091,"
No matter what it says on the back, mento isn't roots' roots--it's secondhand calypso that's been tourist music since Harry Belafonte was a folkie. It's also good dirty fun. Tourist Jules Shear couldn't resist Allan Swymmer's nonchalant vocals or Moses Deans's laggardly banjo, and did the world a turn by getting them down.
"
FALSE,B+,J Is for Jump,Jo Mama,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7147,"
A weird one. This is one of those bands that wants to shove its idea of ""good music"" down the audience's collective throat, and I think most rock and rollers will find the style cute and constricted. But me, I enjoy it, on this album. Danny Kootch's songs are wry, just the way I like 'em, and even the phony cocktail jazz ditty framed by the pseudo-Chick Corea piano excavations sounds good. And though the subtle sexuality that pervades the record is hardly original--vocalist Abigale Haness's stuff goes back to June Christie at least--it still turns me on. So this is recommended to my soul/brain/gonad siblings, with the added warning that it doesn't jump much.

FALSE,B+,The Best of George Jones,George Jones,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7148,"
Don't take the title too seriously--the clenched jaw and rubberband larynx of honky-tonk's greatest honky have graced more albums than he can count (seventy, eighty, like that), and only the Lord knows how many singles he's put out. This is a fairly nondescript selection of ten of them, including one B side and two I can't trace. As usual, the highest-charted are the blandest, and neither of my faves--the hyperextended deception trope ""Tell Me My Lying Eyes Are Wrong"" and the poor white ""Where Grass Won't Grow""--made top ten country.
"
FALSE,B+,The Best of George Jones,George Jones,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7150,"
You can hear why people say Billy Sherrill has compromised Jones on this compilation's only great song, ""The Door""; Bergen White's strings begin tersely enough, but by the end the usual army of interlopers is sawing away, so that you barely notice how Jones lowers the boom on the two ""the""s in the song's final line. Ultimately, though, it isn't the production that makes this acceptable but less than scintillating--it's the conception. Too many of these songs lay out the conventional romantic themes with a slight twist, and there's virtually no room for Jones the honky-tonk crazy, the one who sang ""The Race Is On"" and ""No Money in This Deal."" One Epic cut that would help on both counts is the unsarcastic ""You're Looking at a Happy Man,"" in which his wife leaves him.
"
FALSE,B+,Still the Same Ole Me,George Jones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5092,"
Dumb title, appropriately enough, and every word true--just like his lies about lifetime troth in the title number, one of those inane stick-to-the-medulla-oblongata tunes no one will ever do better. And side-openers, the man has side-openers--a brand-new honky-tonk classic and a brand-new wages-of-honky-tonk classic. Nothing else stands out except for the intrusion of young Georgette Jones (Wynette?) (surely not Richey?) on ""Daddy Come Home,"" which even George can't get away with. But it all stands up.
"
FALSE,B+,One Woman Man,George Jones,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5099,"
Less than no way to tell this is his best album since I Am What I Am nine years ago--Billy Sherrill himself doesn't know, not with two cuts previously released and one of those nothing special. The other, however, is the homicidal ""Radio Lover,"" which I first heard on the makeshift By Request. Points of interest include veteran honky-tonk, shameless tearjerk, and the impossible ""Ya Ba Da Ba Do (So Are You),"" about three icons sitting around talking--Elvis Presley, Fred Flintstone, and George Jones.

FALSE,B+,Warm Leatherette,Grace Jones,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1420,"
When Jean-Paul Goude's chocolate-covered s&amp;m fantasy hit the discos in 1977, she seemed more ""Pretty Vacant"" than ""Send in the Clowns,"" and with DOR taking over the dance floors she admits it, moving in on the unoccupied title tune and taking it from there. With Smokey Robinson and Chrissie Hynde scripting adventures in dominance and fellow Jamaicans Shakespeare and Dunbar adding cyborgian oomph, the theoretical allure of her persona is finally made flesh. I just want to know why Barry Reynolds didn't give ""Bullshit"" to Marianne Faithfull.

FALSE,B+,Living My Life,Grace Jones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1422,"
I still don't know why people get hot and bothered about Jones's statuesque if not motionless voice, but that sure is one great disco band, and each album edges her a little closer to her material. ""Everybody Hold Still,"" about getting mugged, moves the New Yorker in me almost as much as Melvin Van Peebles's unblinking urban matin ""The Apple Stretching,"" and three of the five remaining cuts convince me Jean-Paul Goude doesn't know the half of her.
"
FALSE,B+,Inside Story,Grace Jones,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5100,"
This isn't the weirdest album this weirdo has ever made, not with last year's stupid Trevor Horn cut-up in the running. Sometimes it goes too far, as on the religious title cut: ""How great thou art/How great is art."" And beyond the perfect ""I'm Not Perfect (But I'm Perfect for You),"" Bruce Woolley's tunes aren't up to Nile Rodgers's beats or Grace's lyrics. But the beats strike the perfect balance between David Bowie and Diana Ross, and the lyrics--well, ""Chan Hitchhikes to Shanghai,"" ""White Collar Crime,"" ""Barefoot in Beverly Hills""--what kind of disco diva sings about such things? You got it--a weirdo.
"
FALSE,B+,Your Precious Love,Linda Jones,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7156,"
Jones isn't too long on artistry--she likes to dispense with formality and just start at the climax throwing her emotions and her high notes all over material like ""Dancing in the Street"" and ""I Can't Make it Alone."" Pretty amazing, in its way, and definitely recommended to people who always get out of their cars to look at waterfalls and strange rock formations.
"
FALSE,B+,To Be Immortal,"Oran ""Juice"" Jones",1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5106,"
The push here is an anticrack message that's not as fresh or convincing as he pretends, but whatever the man's relationship to cocaine, he's finally confronted his demon--he can't sing. Not a stupid guy, he hits upon a model more within his means than Blue Magic, generating the best Ray Parker Jr. record since ""Ghostbusters"" obviated the original's need for same. Not a nice guy either, he goes for a harder tone, with real live insight into the ""Gangster Attitude"" he knows so well. But the angular studio funk and talky vocals ring the right bells, and the slow ones you can ignore.
"
FALSE,B+,Back on the Block,Quincy Jones,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2853,"
Q's ecumenicism stands as a beacon to the narrow-minded. Jazz, pop, rap, schlock, anonymous divas he's got a piece of, choruses going doo-doo-doo--they're all black music to him. The superrap with Zulu chant is a crossover worthy (also reminiscent) of Michael J., and Kool Moe Dee and Big Daddy Kane's ""Birdland"" lets Joe Zawinul into the canon while setting up a scat connection that further twists the eternal is-rap-bop-or-dozens? debate. As for Barry White, he's done worse. But he's also done better.
"
FALSE,B+,The Joy,The Joy,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4007,"
Maybe freedom from preconceptions has enabled this group, which never achieved its proper impact to begin with, to make the best comeback LP in memory, but more likely it's the quality of the competition. Because basically this is just a good Joy of Cooking album. It probably helps that Terry Garthwaite and Toni Brown now work with black studio musicians--the white ones on Cross-Country did nothing for them, and neither did the hassle of maintaining a band. But this music is about sure-brained songs and an ever richer vocal interplay, just like always, and if Toni's ""You Don't Owe Me Spring"" reminds me never to forget her penchant for limpid soppiness, everything else makes clear that once a rock band defines itself as adult it need never grow old.

FALSE,B+,Substance,Joy Division,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1857,"
Where New Order's Substance showcases the trajectory of secret singles specialists, Joy Division's recollects the byways of a natural album band. Starting out as unhysterical punks, they follow their pessimism where it leads, into slower tempos and machinelike rhythms, getting excited only at the end of side one, where enveloped by the dark of night they find their beat and shout out ""Dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio."" They follow that beat where it leads, back down into a pessimism that's now frankly romantic and personal if you've got the sense to hear it that way. And then love tears them apart.

I knew Toni Brown was a folkie, so it shouldn't surprise me that a lot of this is organic bullshit gone to rhythm school--the title of the title cut speaks for itself, and ""Sometimes Like a River"" might also be like a ""Rainbow,"" ""Mountain,"" or ""New Wind"" (adjectival scansion, they call that trick in rhythm school). Depressing to hear somebody who knows as much about male-female as ""The Way You Left"" and ""First Time, Last Time"" apply her creative-writing skills to anti-urban bromides. Graded leniently because I like the way (and how much) Terry Garthwaite sings (and writes).

More English eclecticism in the new orthodox mold: eight vocally oriented cuts with a lot of inventive guitar and rhythm effects and excellent song selection. Listen to side two first. An A minus if the vocal mix weren't so muddy--I don't normally complain about such niceties, but on this lp the lack of clarity is noticable and annoying.

Four years after, you can definitely discern an absence--of faith or community or existential confidence, youth or advance money or raw spiritual health. Where once hooks were a pop luxury their holistic groove had no time for, now the JB's sound as dissociated as some tortured hippie manque or privileged gangsta. So catchier would be nice. Yet they remain unique--street, street-tough, devoid of suburban patina or collegiate pretension, yet somehow free of hostility, blissed out in their blackness. Positive, I guess. And the great stuff--the beats concr���""Blahbludify"" and ""For the Heads at Company Z"" and ""Man Made Material,"" maybe the headlong preclimax of ""JB's Comin' Through"" and ""Spittin Wicked Randomness""--experiments more esoterically the Michaels D or Ivey have ever dared.

J. Morrison's funk is pleasingly plump, replete with pear-shaped tenor, well-rounded rhythms, and thick do-it-yourself mix. He has a sensuous way with a melody, and his romanticism is winningly sincere. But not even the lead cut's tricky be-my-baby hook has that get-up-and-dance kick.

Though the results are more interesting than compelling--not to mention postsignificant, prerevolutionary, better than hip-hop, and whatever else Britcrits claim--the drum-machine cut-and-paste of these white rappers cum dance-music guerrillas definitely deserves its footnote in the annals of sampling. Announcing themselves with ""All You Need Is Love"" as AIDS protest, they rob the BBC, rip off hunks of Sly, kidnap Whitney Houston, construct the ultimate Eurodisco homage, and do whatever else they can to give copyright lawyers apoplexy. Of enduring artistic originality and importance for sure, judge.

I was put off at first by the indifference to sales claimed in the booklet that accompanies this. Such smug anticommercialism usually betrays mixed motives in a purportedly political artist, and I associated this smugness with Kahn's willfully austere Appalachian music. But the songs soon shone through, correctives every one (despite an occasional baldness of instructional intent) to the romanticizations of Southern pastoral individualism that are currently so profitable. Kahn is an aficionado of poor-white virtues, but not at the expense of his vivid understanding of the labor, sadness, frustration, and small-mindedness that go along with them.

Guitarist Dragan Ristic is a Serbian Roma impresario-bandleader-propagandist whose preservationism is proudly mongrel in the great Roma tradition. Where Kal's 2006 debut was beefed up by guest instrumentalists and vocalists, the follow-up showcases Ristic's seven-piece ""Rock'n'Roma"" touring unit, which is less full, but peppier. I'll take the tradeoff--try sitting still for the kickoff ""Krasnokalipsa,"" the DNA-altering ""Romozom,"" or the bitter-in-translation ""Ding Deng Dong."" But I could use more input from the likes of Serbian rapper Marcelo at the start and Serbian sister Jelena Markovic at the end. And I still wish Ristic sang not just in Romany, Serbian, Spanish, and French, but English, dammit. Hey, over here! We're the superpower! Aren't we?

Where Konono No. 1 play unpolished though by now self-conscious street music, the second band to get its own Congotronics album is a ""cultural"" collective in which five ethnic groups from Congo's strife-torn, diamond-producing Kasai region fuse and spread their traditions. It serves up the distorted buzz Congotronics fans jones for, sonics that are generally raunchy even though the thumb pianos also generate balafon beauty, and five lead singers. The long track lengths and ritualistic vocals are more village than metropolis even though Kinshasa is their home--and also more village than the Afro-indie hipster might prefer. Afro-indie folkies won't care.

Like Senegalese mbalax and Zairean rumba, Antillean zouk has its schlocky tendencies--singing in Creole doesn't get all the French out of your system. So Celluloid's two U.S. Kassav' LPs, both from the early '80s, feature synthesizers and fancy horns and ladies going duh-do-do-do as well as hot polyrhythms and soul/calypso/rumba horns and the occasional catchy theme. Georges Decimus is pretty tuneless, closing one side with a drum piece that won't signify to anyone who doesn't know the difference between ti bwa and Saint Jean (they're both rhythms), and while Kassav' #5 is a lot catchier, I bet greatest hits plucked from the two dozen albums recorded by the band and its many offshoots would be a lot catchier than that. Saved by the schlock-like-it-oughta-be of ""Anki Nou""--a quiet storm that crosses ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" with ""Maggot Brain.""

Keyboard player (and now vocalist) H.W. Casey and bassman Richard Finch made so much moolah for T.K. prexy Henry Stone that he told them they could spend as much as $3150 on their own LP. What they come up with is the real Miami sound--the sensual Latin accents that really are sensual in New Orleans sound altogether more hyped-up here. ""Queen of Clubs"" was a smash in the Queen's clubs, while ""Sound Your Funky Horn"" and ""I'm a Pushover"" have creased America's soul charts, which makes three hooks right here. A weirdo and a sleeper.

I don't know how many KC albums the record lover need own. One may well be enough, but zero is certainly too few. This is less consistent than the second and more predictable than the first, but it's a close question: Casey and Finch are remarkably inventive within their unique little ambit.

The slight shifts in rhythmic and compositional strategy are dubious. But this band is like the Ramones--the hooks sneak up on you. What can I say? Not only do I love the title cut, but I find myself humming everything else on the record--the slow one, the cover version, the one in Spanish.

Though I'm sure I wouldn't be niggling if every composition on this EP had the electric lyricism and admonitory dolor of ""Back to Zero Now,"" Keene's keen Beatle extrapolation falls just on the other side of what a modern man must hope for.

After studying a video featuring a photo of Ms. Keita, abstract renditions of industrial worksites, and the lyrics in big block letters, I realized that I know enough French to follow a title song that goes, ""Gagner l'argent fran����������""--""Earning French money/Isn't easy, isn't easy."" I even learned a new piece of French slang: bosser, which according to About.com means ""to work, slog/slave away."" That's a song-of-the-year candidate pour moi. Unfortunately, the rest of the lyrics are almost exclusively in Bambara, which in the absence of trots renders the album atmospheric by definition--spare and lovely, but not supernally so. Mastermind Nicolas Repac favors trap drums physical or otherwise, kora, and spookily ethnic-once-removed synths. A duet with gruff-voiced ngoni master Adama Coulibaly changes things up at just the right moment.
"
FALSE,B+,Ko-Yan,Salif Keita,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3079,"
Even as an avowed enemy of his nation's caste system, Keita hasn't abandoned his royal responsibilities--he's exhorting Malians, or maybe West Africans, and hoping others will listen. Thus the lack of a lyric sheet is no great loss for world peace. The lead cut on the A, keyed to a Bambara word that means ""at one and the same time life, fortune, power, reputation and the devil,"" and the lead cut on the B, keyed to a Bambara word that ""refers at one and the same time to the King, power, alcohol and drugs,"" would be hard to translate into English not just linguistically but culturally, and except for the bitterly cryptic black protest ""Nou Pas Bouger,"" everything else seems curious international fare. But in compensation, Ko-Yan corrects Soro's melodrama for groove. The music is still very much composed rather than created or spun out. But the production goes lighter on the atmospheric kora colors, the abrupt bursts of horn, the synch-simulated whistles and pans and balafon, with Keita's voice--often in tandem with a strong female chorus that sounds a lot less Hollywood this time--riding the rhythm in a nice compromise with the dance music Keita mastered leading the Ambassadeurs. And in the end this fusion may teach non-Malians as much about the complexities of modernization as his lyrics ever could. Anyway, isn't it pretty to think so?
"

One of Keita's better conceived and executed albums presents a familiar vexation to the world music appreciator: exactly how to relate to a supremely expressive voice singing about we-haven't-the-foggiest. One attraction of beat-driven Afropop is that it runs this question over with a herd of kudu, as in Keita's years with the Ambassadeurs, a dance band and proud of it. Continuing the big man's recent return to Malian instrumentation, musical overseer Kante Manfila rewards connoisseurs of pop arrangement for its own sake--traditional soloists piling on their flourishes at the close of ""M'Bemba,"" accelerating repetitions at the climax of ""Moriba,"" the look-mama-no-synth washes of the one I know translates ""I'm Going to Miss You"" because it's in French rather than Bambara, the hard grooves of ""Kamoukie"" and ""Ladji"" to stir the blood. When Keita tacks on a ""keyboards and programming"" dance remix, it's just one more fillip.

One good thing about disco manufacturers is that they'll try anything.

Moral Majority take note: The Kendalls are a father-daughter duo who sing about adultery. With each other. Granted, they do invoke all the Calvinist cheatin'-song antinomies--heaven or hell, devil or angel, etc. But ultimately they're soft on sin--their upbeat melodies and perky arrangements make infidelity seem about as heavy as a very successful Tupperware party.

You have to concentrate to hear her outcomp Leon Pendarvis on ""Clouds"" or remold the melody of ""So Naughty"" or bop the funk on ""All Night's All Right.""

From rural Thailand, a loose, multigenerational gaggle of musicians play their lively yet quiet and medium-tempo version of something called phin phayuk, a phin being the traditional, long-necked, three-stringed lute they electrify. Why American enthusiasts call the result ""Psych &amp; Funk"" beats me as it always does. I'm beginning to intuit that ""psych"" means any vernacular instrumental music that seems to wander a little and isn't the mysterious and antique ""jazz."" But ""funk,"" well--it's true my wife always guesses that they're from some sub-Saharan place, but the rhythms are both straightforward and more poky than pushy, their trance factor a matter of scale and timbre even when they get tricky. This is probably why phin phayuk has sounded just right at breakfast on three or four occasions. In rural Thailand, it starts parades. In Manhattan, it's wake up and make the tea music.

Reformed high school teacher August Darnell having split with black-sheep bro Stoney Browder, the music thins out--Dr. Buzzard's progressive retro is hard to top, Darnell's naturally sarcastic voice short on bottom. So the not exactly all-embracing ""Calypso Pan-American"" and ""Off the Coast of Me"" neither justify nor transcend their distanced tone (typically, the title tune affects a megaphone filter), while comedy numbers like ""Bogota Affair"" (the effete Creole as cuckold), ""Mr. Softee"" (the effete Creole as limp-dick), and ""Darrio . . .""

To the shocked rumor that label prexy (and former Dr. Buzzard manager) Tommy Mottola forced August Darnell back into the studio for a quick ""Lambada"" stick on, I say the universalism of that great hit is an improvement. In general here a level of imagination that has always exceeded Loudoun Wainwright's, say, has turned slightly shticky. ""I Love Girls"" is a sinuous sample of the album's disco-funk and a proper first panel for the roue-in-the-age-of-AIDS triptych. But it's not liberating, daring, or even surprising. For wit, all Darnell does is show off his vocabulary. The same goes for the true-crime ""Taking the Rap,"" the sexy ""When Lucy Does the Boomerang,"" and so forth--not even Cory Daye or Prince lift off from the pleasure zone. Biggest exception is the prophetic refrain of ""Laughing With Our Backs Against the Wall"": ""What you gonna do when the money runs out?"" Sign with Sony, of course.

Bluesy soul records aren't getting any easier to come by, and who am I to complain about one with the great B.B. King contributing guitar parts? ""It Takes a Young Girl"" and ""Better Lovin' Man,"" which sound like standards that somehow passed me by, more than make up for the clumsy ""Summer in the City"" and the rereremade ""Five Long Years.""

The Crusaders jam, B.B. jives and raps, and the result--give or take some background vocals and a few overworked horn charts--is the topcat equivalent of the kind of wonderful blues-bar album Bruce Iglauer of Alligator has been getting out of less accomplished musicians throughout the '70s.

King's seldom been terrible, and when in 1978 he decided to stop trying for AM ballads and disco crossovers and move on up to nightclub funk he started making good albums again. With songs by Doc &amp; Dr. (Pomus and ace sideman John) and a band anchored by the spectacularly unflappable Pretty Purdie, this is the third time in a row he's topped himself. The voice is no longer exquisite and the licks might as well be copyrighted, but King's standard is classic. Of course, it's also predictable--though the material reprises the timeworn truisms (heavy on party blues and perfidious women) with palpable enthusiasm, only ""Victim"" stands much chance of entering the repertoire. But if this were the first King album you'd ever hear you'd make damn sure it wasn't the last.

The artist's flair for the duet is such that the most arresting solo here comes when B.B. is driven to new heights by his favorite collaborator, the B.B. King Orchestra. And because he doesn't want to give away his come-ons yet (or else doesn't have any), he sounds more comfortable with the men than the gals. But that's not to say the likes of Robert Cray and Etta James and John Lee Hooker aren't extra added attractions. Or that they don't inspire him to focus--which is really all he needs.

This is my kind of exploitation--a commercial gimmick that gets two masters back to their form. An honorable document it is, too, especially Bland's part. King's voice and guitar have both been more searing, the latter within recent memory, and though I'd rather hear him singing familiar old blues than mediocre new pop, the classic material does resist renewal, which is why he and Bland do so much pop these days.

FALSE,B+,King Biscuit Boy,King Biscuit Boy,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7197,"
King Biscuit Boy/Richard Newell is a Canadian Paul Butterfield, which I mean as a compliment, and when he sings lead with producer Allen Toussaint doing backups it's the ultimate white blues fantasy. In reality, though, Newell's high-strung earnestness and virtuoso harmonica can't take this album away from Toussaint, and like so many of Toussaint's albums it's only half great. But since it divides neatly into a side of Toussaint songs (great) and a side of Newell's (passable), this time you can't blame that on the auteur.

FALSE,B+,USA,King Crimson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7203,"
Since the nearness of death was good for this band, I figured a posthumous live album might be even better, and though lyrics and vocals are still pompous annoyances, these musical themes (including the off-the-cuff ""Asbury Park"") are among their best. In Central Park they have no choice but to skip the subtlety and turn it up. The excitement thus generated is more Wagner than Little Richard--this record is a case study in the Europeanness of English heavy metal. But that doesn't mean it's not classic.

FALSE,B+,Aha Shake Heartbreak,Kings of Leon,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12856,"
There's an early-Stones feel here it would be perverse to deny: 12 songs in 36 minutes, each with an indelible identiriff and its own seductive rhythmic shape. Caleb Hollowill's slippery wiles recall Jagger's without grasping Jagger's gift for the pungent phrase. That Hollowill avoids cock-rock clich������������������s hardly means he's come to terms with the jezebels who were driving backsliding Southern boys past their intellectual limits long before Elvis p"
FALSE,B+,Muswell Hillbillies,The Kinks,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7206,"
Because the Kinks Klaque hyped this as a great album when a simple perusal of the lyrics revealed more of the same olde alienation, I overreacted violently, but in an unsentimental retrospect I can hear it, and I do mean hear. Most of its charms are in the casual-to-messy eclecticism with which it revives time-honored effects from the music hall and the mod era and even the mountains, and in the dotty good humor of Ray Davies's singing, which makes you think that maybe--just maybe--he doesn't take the ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"" of the ""20th Century Man"" at face value. But combine those two titles circa 2001 and you're in the court of the Crimson King.
"
FALSE,B+,Everybody's in Showbiz,The Kinks,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7207,"
A few of the new songs here are as strident as anything Ray Davies has done since before he started playing the recluse in London in the late '60s. They're tight; they have a firm beat; they're, you know, rock and roll. Unfortunately, they're still self-pitying--the reformed recluse doth reflect overmuch these days on the travails of the touring superstar. But for only an extra dollar you get a live album worth at least that, featuring the antics of a reborn showman who has turned stage fright into a way of life and thus rendered his self-pity somewhat more palatable.

FALSE,B+,Celluloid Heroes,The Kinks,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7213,"
Them as wants an overview of Ray Davies's RCA period are referred to this upstanding compilation, with eight cuts from the first two RCA albums and four from the four others. Although such unlikely gems as ""Have a Cuppa Tea"" and ""Look a Little on the Sunny Side"" are overlooked for more obvious staples of the Kinks' road-band phase, none of the selections is bad. But they're all, well, obvious--devoid of Davies's saving grace, which is subtlety, eccentricity, some combination in there. Overview: the knack remains and the craft may actually have increased, but the gift has flown.

FALSE,B+,Groupa Kroovy (Blood Type),Kino,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5149,"
Just Russian new wavers, their translated lyrics unobtrusively poetic, alienated by habit, politically aware, resigned. But Victor Tsoi's solidly constructed tunes have a droll charm that's fresh if not new, and to an English speaker, the physical peculiarities of his talky voice, which saunters along as if a low baritone is the natural human pitch, seem made for the offhand gutturals and sardonic rhythms of his native tongue. When his boys ooh-ooh high behind ""It's Our Time, Our Turn!,"" it's as if someone has finally concocted an answer record to ""Back in the U.S.S.R.""

FALSE,B+,License to Dream,Kleeer,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5150,"
I started with side two, where the light funk of ""Get Tough"" got lost (soulful John Wayne impression and all) between the inspirational title cut (""Speculate positivity don't turn around"") and the smarmy slow one. Turns out there's a light funk tour de force on the A--a mild one, but that's the only way they come. Highlights: ""Running Back to You""'s congas-and-timbales interweave, ""Hypnotized""'s Latin accent, and the sexy slow one.

FALSE,B+,Rhythm and Jews,The Klezmatics,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3680,"
Although neither band is especially pure, and a good thing too, what distinguishes their shtick from that of the Klezmer Conservatory Band, who I enjoy from a respectful distance, is that it honors the shtetl rather than the borscht belt. Their sense of drama precedes vaudeville and, more significantly, musical comedy.
"
FALSE,B+,Apikorsim/Heretics,The Klezmatics,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17000,"
The definitive modern klezmer band's first album of new originals in well over a decade finds them as lovely and lively as ever, with Lorin Sklamberg's tenor plenty pliant in his sixties. Note, however, that it's entirely in Yiddish. I can attest from the booklet that the lyrics bite, uplift, and amuse in translation if you read along. But I advise that you ascertain what you get musically from tracks four-five-six--in English, the frolicsome ""Party in Odessa"" to the bereft ""Dark Is the Night"" to the defiant ""Heretics"" itself. If suitably entranced or intrigued, buy the CD with its cheat sheet. If not, play Possessed again and proceed with your life.

FALSE,B+,UAIOE,KMFDM,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1946,"
In both reggae and rock modes, this twisted Belgian dance band is groovier than the noise norm--positively sinuous sometimes, especially on the pick-to-click ""Murder."" Guest vocalists--metal heldentenor, spliffed-up toaster--add personality, risking the verboten corn. Yet the product emerges unscathed. Dare to struggle, dare to win.

FALSE,B+,Enough Rope,Chris Knight,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13394,"
From the ex-hellion drinking ice tea in his yard to the city laborer who'd rather work his job than wear chains like his cousin Willie, this is where the Kentucky storyteller gets off the outlaw romanticism train, which turned into a Trailways bus years ago. ""Old Man"" deserves to be programmed back to back with John Prine, ""Dirt"" with Freedy Johnston. Still, put him head to head with those guys on the wrong Saturday night and he might still be inclined to kick both their asses.

FALSE,B+,I Feel a Song,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7224,"
Compared to sisters like Aretha Franklin or Tina Turner, Knight is a moderate. Her way with a ballad is suspiciously smooth and direct, and her demeanor flirts with the respectable. But she always radiates a great singer's luminous conviction, and beneath the moderation she's very comfortable with her emotional extremities. When she adds a squeal or a grunt or a growl on this album, or holds back a tear, or turns a song into a trembling sigh, you know she means exactly what she isn't saying, and I've never heard her in better voice. The material is still a little flat, but it does take in uptempo soul and Dionne Warwick pop and Bill Withers funk and Bill Withers sentiment. Plus a version of ""The Way We Were"" that establishes her claim to a middle-class veneer in perpetuity.

FALSE,B+,The Best of Gladys Knight & the Pips,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7226,"

"
FALSE,B+,All Our Love,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5155,"
The CD-era duration does indulge Knight's middle-class vices. At twenty-eight minutes for six songs that are longer on melodrama than break beats, the second side is like a suburban living room that seems overfurnished even though all the pieces are in the best contemporary taste. But Knight has one of those burgundy voices, designed to age, and since her albums have rarely done it justice, the edgy writing and overall strength of this multiproducer soul-dance-pop-whatever comeback is a gift.

FALSE,B+,Close-Up,Bonnie Koloc,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7233,"
This is where Koloc's modest, unmistakable intelligence--and voice--finally make a record work. Not that the old problems don't persist--I disapprove of songs about silver stallions, I'm sick of ""We Had It All,"" and I guarantee that Koloc's own unaccompanied ""I'll Still Be Loving You"" requires more camouflage than her Marxophone (?) coda. But the two Lil Green compositions that kick off side two vie with the originals and would set the right tone even if they didn't. She does all right by Hank Snow's ""Rhumba Boogie,"" too.

FALSE,B+,Africanism,Kongas,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7235,"
This Cerrone-Don Ray concept group is the most convincing rock-disco fusion to date. The 15:21-minute A side sustains the propulsion of ""Gimme Some Lovin'"" for twelve-and-a-half minutes longer than Spencer Davis and Stevie Winwood did, proving (despite one dumb pseudo-seduction interlude) that Stevie's organ roll did more to keep the song going than his famous vocal.

FALSE,B+,51,Kool A.D.,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15825,"
Heems's Das Racist partner favors skinnier, more electro beats, most by his Bay Area compadre Amaze 88, which he loops under raps that carry more weight on this April mixtape than they did on The Palm Wine Drinkard just a few months before--as do the cameos from Mr. Rogers and a chipmunked Huey P. Newton. True, the record shudders to a virtual halt when the ecumenical auteur turns beatmaker midway through, and some may judge the rhymes irresponsibly playful. But he's right about ""Yo these girls are smart man/I'm trying to figure out how to play my part man/I don't know how to start man/The strangest organ is the human heart man/Fuck with shortcuts like I'm Robert Altman/Fuck with long shots like I'm Robert Altman/Fuck with actresses like I'm Robert Altman/Recycled like half a verse but that's art man.""

From the beatless two-finger-piano-plus-sine-wave opener to the minimalist-piano-plus-brushes closer, you'll believe Victor Vazquez is deploying the weirder half of the sessions from which he'll construct two albums. The beats are funkier but never aggressively danceable--synth whistles, skeletal syndrum snatches, organ parts, sandpaper vinyl noise. And the raps are in Spanish and French as well as English, as befits a guy who claims Michael Ondaatje, believes Leonard Maltin and Rick Ross belong in successive 16s, and leads his own prayer circle.

FALSE,B+,Road to the Riches,Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5162,"
From nasty piano steal to harp hook to bicycle horn to layered ear-scrape to Gary Numan cover to Memphis blues again, this is Marley Marl at his most encyclopedic, and G's fast, harsh lisp is straight outta Queensbridge. But there's too much boast, too much money, too much gaydissing no matter how ridiculous. I don't think G is obliged to transcend a spiritual trap he never made. But until he does he'll have to be a genius, not just the new hard on the block, to escape his ghetto.

FALSE,B+,Knowledge Is King,Kool Moe Dee,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1956,"
His beats grander, his samples funkier, his cadences harder, Moe Dee not only ain't no joke, he's lost his sense of humor. He's feeling his age, has something to prove: all that gladiatorial imagery sounds pretty defensive. With help from Teddy Riley, his natural swing puts the first set of boasts across anyway, but on the B, only the magnificent ""Pump Your Fist"" (attention, JDO: he has the chutzpah to call the Middle Passage a ""Holocaust"") shows the kind of knowledge that is power or vice versa.

This safe, sane 15-track summation is sufficient to the old-school veritas of Mohandas Dewese's declaratory beat. It don't stop, and it don't stop. But on his first two albums, and more explicitly if less consistently later, he was also a bridge to the conscious rap that made the old school seem so elementary. How ya like him now depends on how well ya knew him back when.

Volume 2 not for the artist, but for his label's new catalogue exploitation; nine of the 12 tracks also appear on Moe Dee's 1994 best-of, with which it shares its inferiority to his first two solo albums. But the three additions--""Knowledge Is King,"" ""Funke Wisdom,"" ""The Avenue""--show off his brainy independence. Both comps fulfill their destiny. This one goes in the changer.

I know, what could be worse than a sci-fi concept album by Al Kooper, who hasn't been good for a whole LP since early electric Dylan? Only it's really solid, without one bad cut. Kooper's melodies stick to the ribs, and his lyrics are adequate or better, and does he do a job on some oldies from Curtis Mayfield and Smokey Robinson. Recommended.

They say this self-contained Jamaican sextet returns reggae to harmony-group truths, but with Rueben Espuet's falsetto teasing the cover versions till they giggle and Sly &amp; Robbie exploding those beats, their traditionalism sounds pretty pomo to me. Material includes Sarah Vaughan's ""Broken Hearted Melody,"" three Smokey Robinson songs (one credited to ""Unknown""), and a twisted six-minute ""Tequila"" bent further out of shape by samples from ""Pump Up the Volume"" and The Marriage of Figaro.

At 65, the guy ""who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways &amp; firetrucks, not even one free beer"" (that's from ""Howl,"" kids) survives as the great American bohemian. Yeah, he was in a rock and roll band (the Fugs, kids), but pure bohos rarely gravitate toward such large-scale forms. Tuli prefers found photographs, newspaper clippings, stick figures, new lyrics for famous tunes--the best stuff on his legendary 1968 ESP-Disk spoken-word was want ads. So I grant that this excessively long-awaited follow-up is of specialized interest. Still, music-lovers should hear ""Evolution,"" dictated from the other side by John himself; ""Swami"" (""How I love you how I love you/Swami Everykinanda""); ""Way Down South in Greenwich Village,"" an updated '20s classic with ukulele impression; and, no joke, ""Morning, Morning,"" a song about life and death and their fleeting beauty that deserves eternal salvation.

FALSE,B+,Original Sufferhead,Fela Anikulapo Kuti,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4777,"
The musical definition is so sharp it's hooky, with arresting commentary from a backup chorus that includes many of the leader's wives. And the lyrics help, especially ""Power Show""'s bitter observations in re bureaucratic status-tripping. The title (and other) track, in his geopolitical mode, makes its point less cleanly.

Like all groove artists, Fela benefits mightily from marginal differentiation, which on this 1977 outing with Afrika 70 is provided by the blats, splats, and tuneful snatches of Lester Bowie's trumpet. The 15:36 title side is distinguished from its 15:48 companion by a few minutes of Fela mouthing off and a catchier keystone ostinato.

Fears that imprisonment has turned him into a shell can be put aside, and by tacking twelve- and fourteen-minute instrumentals in front of fourteen- and eighteen-minute songs Wally Badarou goes a long way toward solving the man's record-making problem. At half an hour apiece, his grooves have time to prove themselves, and the vinyl sound is bright enough if you pump up the volume a little. As for message, the lyrics are certainly touched by his incarceration, but his pan-Africanism seems unchanged: it's as limited, as scathing, and as justifiable as ever.

Emerging from a groove that maintains, the find is the sole non-title cut. Called ""Power Show,"" it's nothing of the sort. It may not be thoughtful--Fela always reacted more than he reflected. But the laid-back bpms and sour sax make thinking sound like a good thing.

Seated in red suit and executive chair on the cover, the buxom Jamaican blond sprawls on a striped couch in halter and who-knows-what? inside--who knows because her hands cover her split beaver and the CD hole covers her hands. It's the new slackness, confidently and voraciously refusing to become the last big thing. Cribbing ""That's Amore"" and a generic country tune and a properly credited ""Love Is Strange,"" ranging riddimically from something we call oompah to something she calls joy ride, she sings about sex while never confusing power and pleasure or sounding beholden to anyone but herself. Do I like it raw? Well, since you were nice enough to ask . . .

Though it's worse than ridiculous for Grammy tastemongers to classify these slick professionals as folk musicians, they are exotics, subject to foreign pop's law of diminishing returns--after you get past how different it is, you're stuck with differentiating it from itself. So, a couple of hints. One, this is a harmony album; Joseph Shabalala isn't submerged, but he isn't showcased either. That makes for a nice little change. Two, it's a religious album, replete with full translations and 12 ways to sing amen. That one I'm not so sure about.

Transcriptions from the Zulu help the student trace the intricate structures in 48-track detail.

Absolute masters of a self-invented formula neither they nor their fans ever weary of, Ladysmith are like the Ramones at a higher level of musical if not philosophical development.

Never long on personality, these cogs in Dick Griffey's machine can at least muster a consistent compilation (unlike such rival pros as Atlantic Starr, say). Among their eleven years' worth of occasional hits, only one post-'84, are their signature dress-up number ""Fantastic Voyage,"" ""It's All the Way Live""'s primitive forerunner of the ""Good Times"" bassline, and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" as a moderately personable slow one.

The Dr. Dre-anointed Lamar isn't a guy who writes a lot of indelible songs yet, especially if you try to find them toward the top of his much-praised second album. Thus he's liable to leave the curious wondering what the fuss is about. But as I re-relistened I noticed myself perking up with every hook. Not that every track has or wants one, but that, for instance, the sung intros to the cosmetics debate ""No Make-Up (Her Vice),"" track four, and then the crack generation shout-out ""Ronald Reagan Era,"" track seven, come as well-timed structural respites from his thoughtfully private to defensively street raps, which have their musicality too. And then, just when you're thinking not bad at all, come some songs.

Although singles are country's lifeblood, this Nashville chartbuster has been popular music's most consistent album artist for nearly a decade--four solo plus two by the triple-threat Pistol Annies. But on this double-CD, one subtitled ""Nerve"" and the other ""Heart,"" she overreaches, sells herself short, or both--particularly, surprise surprise, on the ""Heart"" disc. Maybe she wants to prove something to her ex Blake Shelton, who I doubt is smart enough to justify the effort. Or maybe she just wants to convince herself she's worthy of a schmaltzfest like ""Tin Man"": ""If you ever felt one breakin'/You wouldn't want a heart."" Needless to say, I greatly prefer the album's sole solo composition, her current hit ""We Can Be Friends""--rude couplets like ""If you use alcohol as a sedative/And 'bless your heart' as a negative"" are why I'll love her forever. But it would be sexist to insist she be all feisty all the time, and a co-write with Pistol Annie Ashley Monroe called ""Use My Heart"" is the love song that proves it--by pondering whether Lambert lacks the ""nerve"" for love. Here's hoping she learns how to put the two together. She deserves it and we need it.

Whether moved by the propinquity of their own folk tradition or by some general attraction to the eccentric, English rockers are at ease with a sprightly sloppiness that is usually left to folkies in the U.S.--they know it's rarely enough to be ""tight."" On this solo debut Lane takes the Faces--not the Faces themselves, but their hang-loose playfulness--into the English countryside with saxophone, tambourines, an accordion, and a choir of communards. Whether undergoing his own reincarnation on ""Stone"" or coming on randy and rude in ""Ain't No Lady,"" he sounds sweet and independent; he covers Fats Domino and Chuck Berry and ""Brother Can You Spare a Dime.""

Formally, this is reactionary, from Lane's chesty melismas to the band's fakebook licks, and the songs go on too long. But every one catches, and despite Lane's lady-macho stage moves, her lyrics seem felt in what I can only call a progressive way--autonomous but not anomic or selfish, compassionate but not infinitely longsuffering.

Finally she swells with the contained enthusiasm of Tracy Nelson Country 20 years ago, back when authenticity wasn't such a vexed concept. Willie Nelson's ""Three Days"" and Wynn Stewart's ""Big Big Love"" do stand out, but not so's they embarrass Lang's originals, most of which are pretty metaphysical for country music. They're just highlights, like her own lusty ""Big Boned Gal"" and her own metaphysical ""Luck in My Eyes."" And ""Nowhere to Stand"" is an even smarter (and more abstract, fancy that) battered-child song than Suzanne Vega's or Natalie Merchant's. Maybe it's out of place on a quasiauthentic country record, though you have to like how she sneaks in the phrase ""family tradition."" But vexed concepts cut two ways.

After that, fittingly but dishearteningly (although under the circumstances that's fitting too), the songcraft wends its way gradually downhill; not even the title track provides much of a rise. Only then comes a finale called ""Strange Ways to Win Wars"" and Langford is on top of things again--not young because he's not that kind of liar, just strong and clear-eyed as he quietly and suggestively surveys our disheartening politics: ""And no one is spared, no one is spared/No one is spared, no one is spared.""

LaSalle seems to be a songwriter first and a singer second, which may be why there's a certain professional anonymity about her unusual moods. But the voice is there--sensual, warm, even wise, ideal for Willie Mitchell's meditative Memphis funk. And because she's a pretty good songwriter, just about every one of these twelve tracks offers its professional pleasures.

FALSE,B+,Rain and Fire,Denise LaSalle,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5346,"
LaSalle earns enough in Malaco's songwriting stable to limit her recording career to a humdrum album every year or two, and since that's all she managed as a perpetual also-ran, there was no reason to hope for serendipity. But here she learns her revenge from the soaps and her tune from George Jackson, throws role model Sylvia Robinson a cover, name-drops all over a toot-toot follow-up, and demonstrates what Millie Jackson might be today if she hadn't put on airs--a teller of truths too raunchy for the country moralists who prime but fail to satisfy her market. Highpoints include the eight-minute saga ""It Be's That Way Sometime"" and dovetailing critiques of the hard-on, ""Dip, Bam, Thank You Ma'am"" and ""It Takes You All Night"" (""To do what you used to do all night""). Plus this Inspirational Verse: ""They can't eat no more, no sir/They got anorexia nervosa.""

Great falsettos like Smokey Robinson and Clyde McPhatter flow uphill, while lesser ones like Maurice Gibb and Russell Thompkins settle for the formal panache and expressive limitation of acknowledged artifice. Lasley certainly doesn't flow, but he doesn't settle, either--his struggle toward full emotional range sounds forced at first, but then willed, which is different. Playing head voice for homosexual angst rather than love-man tenderness or androgynous affect, he sets his colloquial confessions to pristine studio soul backup completely appropriate in a concept album about a white guy in love with black music. But at times it does seem forced.

The artiest love man since Eugene Record wasn't the next Dylan, Lasley adds a wonderful rap for ""queers"" and a terrible street-talk verit������""Euripides Meets the Shangri-Las"" to his straightforward sha-la-la lyrics and Brill Building grooves, with fellow Detroiter Don Was throwing in Linn drums and such. His falsetto has gained color and heft, too.

FALSE,B+,The Noise of Trouble (Live in Tokyo),Last Exit,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1999,"
The return of free jazz was inevitable in this time of '60s nostalgia, and believe me, it could be a lot worse. At least Bill Laswell and Ronald Shannon Jackson revert to rhythm when the path of pure inspiration peters out, and Sonny Sharrock is without sonic peer. Somewhat less imposing is the group's unacknowledged center, West German saxophone legend Peter Br������������������tzmann, but Ornette himself couldn't make consistent music out of a concept that eschews not only heads but rehearsal, and he probably wouldn't want to. Consistency's not the idea--becoming is, and those who'd rather watch childbirth movies may have a point. All three of the group's albums are live. Last Exit documents the blinding headache of their first gig and is often played by Lester Bangs to keep angels and rock critics away. My sentimental favorite is Cass""Big Boss Man,"" because its ""Ma Rainey"" mentions Alexander Pope, and because half of it was recorded in Allentown. But this is the one that actually comes together. The so-called suite kind of is, ""Panzer Be-Bop"" is pure atonal convergence, and Herbie Hancock sticks in his two cents like he knows what for.

FALSE,B+,Hear No Evil,Bill Laswell,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=308,"
Only such a cold bastard could conceive new age so undisgusting. Some hear Another Green World in the thing, and there's that. Also r&amp;b readymades and George Harrison's Wonderwall and packages of free noodles. I swear I can hear him laughing; sometimes I laugh myself. I swear he thinks it's good of its kind, too. So do I.

FALSE,B+,More More More Latimore,Latimore,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7255,"
After last year's covers of ""Take Me to the Pilot,"" ""So Much Love,"" and ""For What It's Worth"" I hoped I'd never run into the fellow again, but here he gets basic. His voice is too ordinary to put any of the three blues up with the Bland, King, or Mabon original. But he likes what he's singing so much that he doesn't have to go for the simulated high emotion of some fancy vocal embellishment--he just puts those lyrics across, intelligent and matter-of-fact, as if you've never heard them before, which maybe you haven't.
"
FALSE,B+,Latimore III,Latimore,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7256,"
Mixing Lou Rawls and Swamp Dogg in a soul-stud groove that climaxes on the fast side with his sympathetic impression of ""a redneck in a soul band"" and is softened on the (less impressive) slow side by a spirited but thoughtful rendition of ""Ladies' Man,"" a song about not getting it up that's probably the best thing Oscar Brown Jr. ever wrote.
"
FALSE,B+,Dig a Little Deeper,Latimore,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7258,"
In seven solid, funk-rooted tunes this obdurate soul holdout portrays, in order, a long-suffering on-the-road monogamist, a stud on the prowl, a reluctant lay (""We got to hit if off before we get it on,"" he tells a ""liberated woman""), a sentimental monogamist, a sex slave, a good lover (title tune), and a seducer of virgins (courtesy Rod Stewart). And convinces in all seven roles. Very impressive. But I don't believe I'll introduce him to my wife.

FALSE,B+,I'll Do Anything for You,Latimore,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5349,"
As T.K. was folding in 1980, this after-the-fact soul hero resorted to L.A. session men to define his seriousness, which proved no less schlocky than most pop seriousness. But his 1982 return to his roots on Malaco was only slightly less schlocky, because at least temporarily the man has lost his knack as a composer. Here the title tune and the first three cuts on side one are the hottest soul tracks of a year that saw as many new soul albums as the previous three or four put together, but it isn't just the Mississippi rhythm section that's catapulted him back into the action. It's also the Memphis songwriting stable. Say thank you to George Jackson and Denise LaSalle.

As I hope his guru tells him, Narada Michael Walden is always better off Helping Others, and who better than this going-on-fourteen cross between Teena Marie and Michael Jackson, whose natural cuteness absorbs the sickly-sweet aftertaste of Walden's jumpy little tunes?

FALSE,B+,Walker County,Eddy Lawrence,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5354,"
A folkie who works in NYC, Lawrence cultivates a pastoral gift for vernacular narrative, as in the Alabama locale of his title and most of his material--lots of red dirt gone to asphalt, farmland gone to housing tract, homes gone to trailers. Sure he veers into sentiment, but only the instrumental is without its turn of phrase.

FALSE,B+,Whiskers and Scales and Other Tall Tales,Eddy Lawrence,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1129,"
You know the routine--local folkie sets down with a couple of stringed instruments and lets fly. It works or it doesn't; usually it doesn't. But Lawrence is showing off so much eye, ear, and imagination that his stories barely require the appearance of music. Try the catfish farmer. Or the Marine's big-talking little brother. Or the bigamous lady trucker with the girlfriend in Wisconsin. Or Tommy's mommy's swami playing hide the salami. He's even moderately funny about fishing.

FALSE,B+,Led Zeppelin III,Led Zeppelin,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2012,"
If the great blues guitarists can make their instruments cry out like human voices, it's only fitting that Robert Plant should make his voice galvanize like an electric guitar. I've always approved theoretically of the formula that pits the untiring freak intensity of that voice against Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs, and here they really whip it into shape. Plant is overpowering even when Page goes to his acoustic, as he does to great effect on several surprisingly folky (not to mention folk bluesy) cuts. No drum solos, either. Heavy.

FALSE,B+,Physical Graffiti,Led Zeppelin,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2015,"
I suppose a group whose specialty is excess should be proud to emerge from a double-LP in one piece. But except on side two--comprising three-only-three Zep classics: ""Houses of the Holy,"" ""Trampled Under Foot,"" and the exotic ""Kashmir""--they do disperse quite a bit, not into filler and throwaway (""Boogie with Stu"" and ""Black Country Woman"" on side four are fab prefabs) but into wide tracks, misconceived opi, and so forth. Jimmy Page cuts it throughout, but after a while Robert Plant begins to grate--and I like him.

FALSE,B+,In Through the Out Door,Led Zeppelin,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2016,"
The tuneful synthesizer pomp on side two confirms my long-held belief that this is a real good art-rock band, and their title for the first ten minutes or so, ""Carouselambra,"" suggests that they find this as humorous as I do. The lollapalooza hooks on the first side confirms the world's long-held belief that this is a real good hard rock band. Lax in the lyrics department, as usual, but their best since Houses of the Holy.

They really were pretty great, and these eight outtakes--three from their elephantine blues phase, three from their unintentional swan song--aren't where to start discovering why. But despite the calculated clumsiness of the beginnings and the incomplete orchestrations of the end, everything here but the John Bonham Drum Orchestra would convince a disinterested party--a Martian, say. Jimmy Page provides a protean solo on ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" and jumbo riffs throughout.
"
FALSE,B+,Laura Lee,Laura Lee,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7263,"
The original title was Two Sides of Laura Lee, which went the way of the ""Empty Bed Blues"" promised on the jacket but still sums up the idea: soften up that man-hating persona. It succeeds, too, with songs from the Honey Cone's production team that give Lee, a gritty singer who can't match the power of a Millie Jackson or the spunk of an Ann Peebles, a chance to show off the recitatives at which she excels--I'm especially fond of ""At Last,"" where Lee falls for a nice boy. But the prize is on the ""other"" side--""Rip Off,"" the real follow-up to ""Women's Love Rights,"" which I'll bet was boycotted by male program directors because it was about property as well as sex.

FALSE,B+,Death of Innocence,Legal Weapon,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5358,"
Since like so much L.A. gothic this punk metal cultivates melodrama with an enthusiasm that could be campier, I don't quite know how to take Kat Arthur's tales of young woe. If she really did get sodomized by daddy on the floor, the hooky crudity of her response is guts ball. But if she just thought incest a fitting hook for such a crude grabber of a riff, she should have thought some more. And the strain of such distinctions renders the crudity less satisfying than its hooks warrant.
"
FALSE,B+,Your Weapon,Legal Weapon,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5359,"
The follow-up is less unrelenting, but it's also subtler in crucial little ways--tempo change here, Byrdsy decoration there, burr in the throat all over the place. Kat Arthur may well be turning into Joan Jett with something to say and something else to say it with. She's still young and she still means it, but she's gained perspective on her bombed-out blues.

On her debut, the masked marvel keeps things simple, showing off her stuff in an impressive assortment of what are more chants, jingles, and ditties than songs. After all, what bizzer in his or her right mind would say no to a young nobody who sneaks the assonant ""Ski mask under my hijab"" into her opening track? Next she's late to work because that Juvenile song she loves comes on. ""Money""--""Not the cemetery / Or the penitentuary""--is followed by ""M I L K,"" which is not to be pronounced ""milk."" Attend also to the ragga ""Bubblegum"" and the area-code-literate ""Ho.""

It would be silly to insist that there's much musical magnetism in the archly received/sampled arrangements or sad-sack delivery of this young Swede's official debut album. But it would be stupid not to want to hear the lyrics again--and again. ""Yeah I got busted/So I used my one phone call to dedicate a song to you on the radio""? Quiet yet audacious. ""When I said I wanted to be your dog/I wasn't coming on to you/I just wanted to lick your face""? You can't argue with that. ""Lick those raindrops from the rainy day/You can take me for a walk in the park""? But that doesn't mean he can't top it.

Lema knows too much keyboard. Orchestrating for drama and structure, he ends up with a music of brilliant passages--now Ellingtonian, now almost Brazilian. If you equate Zaire with the eternal groove you'll find him irritating. But if you get your kicks contemplating rhythms as well as consuming them, try this rooted fusion of soukous, funk, reggae, mbaqanga, rock, fusion, and whatever--complete with shrewd, languid vocals of equal intelligence, or wisdom.

Eleven shots in the dark from the weirdest major rock and roller of the early '70s. All the hits are here, many of them misses, with the number-one single as out of place as ""Happy Xmas"" and ""Woman Is the Nigger of the World."" Not just because it's bad, either--in retrospect, ""Whatever Gets You Through the Night"" and ""Power to the People"" sound equally bald, equally stupid. Not counting the two available on must-own albums, the only great cuts are ""Instant Karma"" (Lennon's best political song) and ""#9 Dream"" (catchier nonsense pop than McCartney's ever managed). So I don't play it much. But I'm sure glad it's on the shelf.

The late-night session-band workups of songs later embalmed on Walls and Bridges are startlingly stark and clear, making side two the finest music of the hiatus between Imagine and Double Fantasy, whose precisely felt studio-rock they prefigure. Phil Spector produced the commercial versions. He also produced Rock 'n' Roll, source of the outtakes on side one, which were rejected because they're even stiffer than the intakes. John never could figure out what to do about loving Rosie &amp; the Originals. And Phil wasn't the guy to tell him.

With Texophiles buzzing these guys up as the roadhouse band of a college cowboy's dreams, I was put off some--that big, brawling sound has never been this honorary pencilneck's idea of Saturday night.

Gyrating second vocalist Joe Doerr joins the Texas quartet whose neoroadhouse album went cult last year. The kid sings like he only masturbates twice a day because his boner makes it impossible for him to walk to his car, adding a memorable rockabilly urgency to ""Treat Her Right"" that puts the manly confessional boasts ""Ain't I'm a Dog"" and ""D.W.I."" in suitably adolescent perspective.

These anthemic Parisian punks are all form and no conviction, except for the conviction that form is everything. And despite the always uncharismatic and often choral vocals, this suffices. The proximate source is probably PiL--if ""Papapapa"" isn't their ""Poptones,"" my name is Jah Wobble. But because they mean to be inspirational, even uplifting, they also evoke the Buzzcocks, not to mention Brian Eno (not to mention 999). Trust the French to do neoclassicism right.

After a 34-minute art project that ended up a great album, a 17-minute EP ends up an art project. ""Get Off the Internet"" was overdue and ""They want us to make a symphony out of the sound of women swallowing their own tongues"" does us the honor of taking its title literally. But don't be so sure either will hold up like ""Gone b4 yr home."" Male chauvinist boyfriends are eternal.

You said it, the man's an utter cornball, but on this album I simply succumb to the stupid pleasures of his big fat rockcraft. Even though I know it isn't the ""same old back beat"" that keeps rock and roll alive, but rather musicians brave or bored enough to fuck with it, something same-old has me grunting with pleasure at that song every time I let down my guard. No guard required: ""I Want a New Drug"" (recreational), ""Bad Is Bad"" (bad), and ""Walking on a Thin Line"" (when are Vietnam Veterans Against the War putting together their compilation album?).

Late great New York bohemian Kupferberg loved ""parodies,"" which originally just meant songs that set new lyrics to old tunes: the more erotic than fetishistic ""I Want to Hold Your Foot,"" say, or ""This Train Is Bound for Brooklyn,"" as in ""This train is bound for Brighton / If you wanna go to Bay Ridge you're not on the right one."" But he also wrote the enraptured Fugs threnody ""Morning Morning,"" covered by such worthies as Joan Baez and Spyder Turner but done just as right by the living-room sing-along Lewis convened for this album. This approach has its limitations, but gets the job done. Try ""What Are You Doing After the Orgy?,"" melodicized by Lewis from a Kupferberg notebook, which dreams of extracting friendship from orgasm. Try ""Life Is Strange,"" where an aged heir of Aristide Bruant reports he's perfectly OK with never having once seen Paris.

FALSE,B+,Acid Tongue,Jenny Lewis,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14196,"
Like so many solo statements, this one's awash in freedom of choice--string section on demand, a drummer who knows her place, arrangements jenny-rigged beneath verses that could use a groove, and three male notables, including Elvis Costello himself. Only a talent as major as Lewis could half bring it off. But note that it's Rilo Kiley's Jason Boesel whose drums set off the lazy ""See Fernando,"" about a secular saint who'll always buy a sinner a beer, and the wicked ""Carpetbaggers"", about dirty-booted jezebels tricking innocent young things into helping with the groceries. With Boesel helping, the nine-minute ""The Next Messiah"" may well convince you that her dad or someone like him was a power-mad con artist. But he fails to deliver ""Jack Killed Mom"" from the skeptical scrutiny due all songs on oedipal themes since the Doors' ""The End.""

The hardest-rocking Lewis album in years and the best London-meets-the-legend promotion since Howlin' Wolf's is amazingly consistent and authoritative--Lewis's patented hick cool always provides its satisfactions. But the impersonality of the no-gaffe two-disc supersession encourages his habit of expressing compassion and pain without any show of conviction. Of course, that's part of his charm. And you've gotta hear Rory Gallagher take Elmore James's part on ""Whole Lotta Shakin'.""

Fans of monopoly capital will please explain how this belated subclassic of hortatory soul could happen anywhere but on a Southern indie label.

These would-be ingenues rarely go all the way. They don't always sing flat, but they always make you nervous about it, and both their consciousness and their English are pretty rudimentary for kin of Fela and Soyinka. Not nonexistent, however--unlikely as their guileless vocal affect makes it seem, how can a song that goes ""We're cashing in prostitution yeah/Cashing in revolution yah"" be anything but bitterly ironic? (Right??) This best-of isn't everything it might be--Mother Africa's ""Iya Mi Jowi"" would spruce it up substantially, for instance. But with producer Biddy Wright hooking them up, it's a minor girlpop treasure with a considerable difference.

There was apparently a Shanachie best-of I never heard back in '84, but in this heyday of obscurantist crate-digging, now the entire four-album catalogue of these beauteous second cousins of Fela and Wole Soyinka will be released over a one-year span. The debut was Danger and it's lame, English-language moralism further weakening wan attempts at the pop equanimity the Shirelles and lesser females achieved so sweetly so long before. On this follow-up, though, the sustaining grooves the title half-promises buoy gentle soprano harmonies attached to messages I know enough not to be curious about. Instead there are the thrumming pressure drums, the clarinet obbligato that could be a soprano sax obbligato, the guitar solo that could be a synth solo, the spoken praise of the moon delivered by multi-instrumental mastermind Biddy Wright. All of which, I suspect, could be readily accommodated by a new best-of that also isolated a keeper on Danger itself.

Formerly Kleenex has kept the faith even though only the lead cuts pack the goofy punch of ""Split""'s massed whistles and saxophones, or the chaotic rallying cry ""Eisiger Wind""--not to mention ""U,"" or ""You,"" or ""Ain't You."" Where the Slits aspire to Mango and the Raincoats to ECM and the Au Pairs to Grunt, these women clearly belong with the rest of Rough Trade's amateur anarchohumanists; they're the best thing to happen to Switzerland since John Berger. In another context I might disapprove of the clumsy white funk toward which their instrumental atmosphere has evolved, or fret about just what their references to ichor, stilts, and kicking heels mean. But this music combines the spirit of a kindergarten rhythm band with the sophistication of a wartime art school, just like the real Cabaret Voltaire.

Ry Cooder). Does only passably by the golden oldies (compare ye golde Everlys, Tempts, Isleys/Beatles), comes up with middling-to-good ""originals"" (by one Bob ""Frizz"" Fuller except for the aptly titled ""Pay the Man""), and knocks you dead with the obscure covers (cf.

The problem with Lowell George isn't so much that he doesn't write good songs as that he doesn't write great ones. He's immersed in blues--it's his idiom. But his own boast to the contrary, ""eloquent profanity"" doesn't come easy to him, and it should--in a real blues artist, the secret of a simple trope like ""Two Trains"" is that it seems spontaneous and conventional both at once, while George's clenched throat and staggering slide bear witness to his creative effort. None of which is to say that these aren't good songs--when George finds the right trope (or when Bill Payne finds a piano part like the one that hooks the title cut) the strain is part of the fun.

From the daring little piano hook of ""I Can Give You More"" to Russell Simmons's motormouth prevarications on ""That's a Lie"" to the humble love-man details of ""I Want You,"" this is the most engaging and original rap album of the year. But the post-Run-D.M.C. school does betray a penchant for what you might call bourgeois individualism. Laying off messages is one thing, but the Hollis crew rarely projects much community or solidarity either. Which sometimes leaves a solo artist alone with his DJ and his fine self.

Lloyd really has his pop down, and this record never fails to cheer me when it comes on--the songwriting and guitar textures are consistently tuneful and affecting. I don't mind that he always sings off-key, either--part of the charm of his pop is how loose it is. But the voice is so wacked-out that even if you'd never seen Lloyd lurching around a stage or matching magic with Tom Verlaine you'd sense that where for the Shoes or the Beat teen romance is a formal stricture, for him it's an evasion--he's just not telling us what he knows.

In crucial ways he predates punk, and formally this is more Warren Zevon or Tom Petty than Tom Verlaine. What makes it go isn't songwriting--please, kids, never ever rhyme ""fire"" and ""funeral pyre."" It's Lloyd's concentration, plus of course his guitar, which I'll take over Mike Campbell's or even Waddy Wachtel's nine tries out of ten.

Like any aspiring popstar, this sweet-voiced world-music natural from Niger and Dakar thrives on a format that isolates his trickiest tunes. Not especially danceable, too slick to power through the wall of incomprehension that separates Anglophones from his multilingual homilies, this best-of showcases an expansive adept of Eurovision style. The synthesizer isn't my favorite ax either. But it can cut through the undergrowth like anything else.

Skip the annoying skit. Then play and preserve in whatever passes for your permanent collection five consecutive autobiographical songs so detailed and painful and loving and classic I have to name them all: ""My Life,"" ""Meant for Me,"" ""Mommy I'm a Princess,"" ""Mrs. Williams,"" and the amazing ""College,"" beat just a drum with three different DeJs rapping over and behind and in between each other. After a much better skitit's DeJ ordinaire, with the advisory ""Go for What You Know"" and the skeptical ""More Money, More Problems"" worth active attention. But the shit's still free and out there, and don't kid yourself--it won't always be.

Then that killjoy Future starts nosing around, and I mean literally, in her pussy, which is as joyful as that one gets. And then comes two pieces of theoretical product I hope earn her a full-length.

Lofgren has apparently regained his prodigious gift for the hook, and most of these songs catch and hold. But his visionary flash has dimmed. Somehow I expect more of this always-the-best-man never-the-popstar than a concept which demands devotion from his various women on one side while declaring devotion to his career on the other.

Struggling for cred as aging rappers will, they stumble occasionally. Some of these ideas obviously seemed funnier when they brainstormed them--the Bloomberg rap that could be any cartoon mayor's, the incomprehensible ""Spell It Out,"" the flat conceit of not giving a ""honk""--and many come down well on the amusing side of hilarious. But most are amusing, and a few--the Robyn-fueled dance instructions of ""Go Kindergarten,"" the manly boasts of ""Diaper Money,"" the you-only-live-once-(so-watch-it) advisory that builds to ""Two words about furniture: killing machines""--are as inspired as anything on Incredibad, where they wouldn't have fit because the rappers were younger then. Best DVD extra: the gay marriage-themed ""Spring Break Anthem.""

FALSE,B+,Things Fall Apart,Lonesome Bob,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2105,"
A Nashville naysayer with a painful vision of domestic truth, a robust rocker who's fond of words like ""overidealized"" and ""problematic,"" an organic intellectual who looks on the dark side, this guy is too smart to let the music take care of itself. But music isn't where he puts his conceptual energy. On maybe half these songs, he gets the words just right--cf. the outrageous ""My Mother's Husband,"" about not always getting what you want, and the merely clever ""What Went Wrong,"" about the practical parameters of psychotherapy. Every time he does, the music sounds fabulous.

The down-to-earth poor-boy stance is an improvement on the boho excesses of the new L.A., though sometimes it's hard to pin down why these impressively particular songs go with this impressively seamless country-rock synthesis. Put it this way--they don't soft-pedal life's big fat downside, but they're good-humored about it. If you don't pay attention, you think Mel Tillis's ""(Sweet) Mental Revenge"" is one of theirs.

""Looking for Lewis and Clark"" is some anthem, but like ""Start Me Up"" it may reveal more than it intends. These guys seek the explorers rather than the wilderness for the same reason they name Gram Parsons and Tim Hardin as forefathers, rather than Hank and Lefty. The self-conscious distance may be healthy--whatever drove Parsons and Hardin to their roots also turned them into dead junkies. But it's got to cut into the immediacy of the music, and for all the informed intelligence of songs like their tribute to black Memphis superstation WDIA, the album does come to a point at ""State of My Union,"" which aggravates the honest chauvinism of Ronnie Van Zant's reflections on the same subject with the gratuitous self-righteousness of Neil Young's.

FALSE,B+,The Real Chuckeeboo,Loose Ends,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5776,"
Conceived in London and cut in Philadelphia, their funk is so suave and supple that on previous albums it slipped into the background without anyone noticing, including them--and until now, me. Here the ballads have more energy and the groove has more thwock, with the result that the whole first side moves like a living thing. This is fitting--despite a modicum of drum/keyb programming and a plethora of overdubs, the two instrumentalists constitute a band almost neotraditional in its liveness, its discreet spontaneity and sinuous swing. And the three voices are deployed with sensuality and effervescence.

Two born buskers split a six-song EP that contains, the very idea, at least four identifiable songs. Pioneering Courtney-basher Lord covers Lucinda Williams and follows Kelly Willis and Two Nice Girls to a Janis Martin rockabilly number. Sean Tillmann deserts the one-man punk band Calvin Krime to wax sardonic about his funeral and his misspent youth, both of which I hope he lives to enjoy.

Having achieved world renown as a 16-year-old innocent with a throaty voice, a head on her shoulders, and the nerve to dissent from a style of upward mobility invented by black people a pole away, she returns four years later as what else--a pop property with a sex life. Thus her chief musical collaborator is Taylor/Sia/Carly Rae helpmeet Jack Antonoff rather than New Zealand svengali Joel Little, and it's Antonoff plus the extra grain in her voice that make the difference here. For me, the most meaningful line is ""Put my hands under your T-shirt,"" because it suggests someone who's thought about how this sex thing works. Deep, no. Real, in theory. Sex life, presumably. Pop property, absolutely.

FALSE,B+,Strange Trails,Lord Huron,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16675,"
Repurposing sonics from Buddy Holly and Workingman's Dead, this beguilingly melodic and cheerful-sounding record is about love and death at the end of the world--a world that for metaphorical purposes is barely settled woods and wilderness without a trace of the urban jangle and connected chaos that drive so many under-30s to distraction. The idea being that even without that postmodern stuff bearing down, life'll get you good, although sometimes they confuse life with pretty girls who don't work out because they're devilish or full of fate. But assuming the urban jangle doesn't spiral out of control, they could beat this thing yet. That's why they bother with the tunes.

Though I wish they'd re-remixed the I-wanna-sit-on-your-face one even further into the pornographic stratosphere, here at last is product brazen and unwavering enough to live up to the canard about never underestimating the power of cheap music. Sure disco denizens already know its four hooks and big-beat blare backwards and forwards. But ignoramuses like me might as well pick up a few sex tips while broadening our cultural horizons.

The painful detail and joyful exuberance are there once they get going. But in under two years this Welsh punk sextet has matured/devolved from tromping over their pan-sexual alienation like so many glockenspiel-wielding grape dancers to enacting ""miserabilia"" about how unfulfilling it is to get on your knees next to a urinal. Things aren't always so dire, and maybe that one is more ironic than the album title. But the joy of convincing punters they're a band is wearing off, leaving wordman Gareth less inclined to joke around about not just urinals but half-requited love and the ""catastrophe"" they still make a musical stab at staving off. So this really could be ""The End of the Asterisk,"" and to put a point on it they bait their second 2008 album with one of the most underwhelming tour DVDs ever cross-collateralized. How little fame it takes these days to mess with people's heads.

Jerry Jeff Walker's backup band transcends its own roots to offer the best evidence to date for Austin's rep as the last refuge of the hippie visionary. The record will probably stand as the best by a new group this year; side one is virtually unflawed; and Gary Nunn's ""Money"" reminds me of Peter Townshend's ""Tattoo"" in its understated rock and roll eloquence.

Doug Sahm produced these four young Chicanos from Salinas, and they share his uncomplicated commitment to the pleasure of making music with a good beat. Even more than Sahm, though, they're influenced by the ballroom--leader Louis Ortega's sincere, one-dimensional lyricism harks back to early Airplane and Dead, as does the band's flowing, literally laid-back 4/4. Good lyrics, too. Inspirational Verse: ""Once you said you loved me baby/Now I cry for that one time.""

FALSE,B+,The Lounge Lizards,The Lounge Lizards,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3693,"
John Lurie has a real gift for night-crawling high-kitsch themes, but to hear him improvise alongside Arto Lindsay is to learn how hard it is to make music out of noise. After all, it's the precisely timed cut-'em-up verve with which Arto skronks and gweezes into the themes that gives the Lizards their edge. But for some reason--weak takes? rushed mix? Lurie's sense of posterity? vanity, perhaps?--he's all but inaudible on many cuts here. Result: Slaughter on Tenth Avenue Goes to the Mudd Club--fun, but not the real fake.

Before they were a mediocre jazz group or a hot fusion band they were a mordant postpunk concept, the avant-Raybeats. More than their antiseptic Editions EG album, this captures their raw sleaze, not to mention John Lurie's reptillian embouchure and (on three cuts) Arto Lindsay's cool-defying guitar.

The record ends with John Lurie grousing about the way his minions skip practice. Disgusted, he says the hell with it himself and checks out a party, soon revealed as the source of the greasy, swinging groove underpinning his voiceover. Lurie likes the music so much that he goes into the next room to peep the band, and oops, it's the Lizards. On none of the garish set pieces preceding this capper do they sound so at ease with themselves. But on every one they sound as sardonic as the guy who thought it up. Which is how he wants it.

On side one the Jimi Hendrix tribute of (Arthur Lee's) Vindicator gives way to an Otis Redding, from simple songs to rhythmic gutturals, although Lee the ironic popmeister sticks his head in twice, which makes the naive optimism of ""With a Little Energy"" seem a little less one-dimensional. Different Lees contend for side two--Otis, Jimi, Arthur, the weirdo who thought of ""Singing Cowboy,"" and sewer designer William DeVaughn, whose top-five hit from earlier this year Lee has the audacity to cover. Be thankful for what you've got indeed.

Too bad these punk-going-no-wave neotraditionalists didn't study their Ramones harder--instead of crowding 21 songs into 45 minutes, they might have grouped the 14 snappiest into a dandy 27-minute shot in the dark. Of course, that would have consigned most of conceptualist Alan Licht's to the cutting-room floor. Here's hoping Licht gets bored like the arty dilettante he is.

What his claque cheered as wit, wisdom, and soul I suspected of meanness, pretension, and bald (ha ha) expropriation, but now that he's gone Hollywood, I enjoy his smarts and sound. Right, there is the character who killed his grandma for her gold tooth la-dee-dah. But whether he's flattering penguins, flirting fruitlessly with waitresses and record ladies, getting Dr. King's picture out of South Carolina, or nailing the limits of somebody else's soulful sincerity, he keeps it sprightly. This is pop, where clever gets you further than wise.

Lush, charming, and powerful, this is the most tuneful way to feed a Barry White jones. I admit that the titles on side two go ""I Needed You--You Were There,"" ""I Belong to You,"" ""I Love You So, Never Gonna Let You Go,"" and ""Love's Theme,"" but Jerry Ragovoy's ""Move Me No Mountain"" sums up White's basic pitch better than White ever has (read that title again), and anyway, lyrics aren't the point. The point is the voices, which have taken on enough personality to be called archetypal as opposed to anonymous--sensitive, willing, and a little more credulous than is good for them.

When I heard the funky force-beat of ""Night Time DJukeing"" I was delighted--sounded like the man had invented DOR all on his own, and in Wales yet.

He's shed one guitar player and no hooks and as a man he's probably better for it: his cool seems more casual, his lust more committed. But the music is tossed off with what sounds like indolence rather than charm, and since Billy Bremner and Terry Williams are still on hand it would be too pat to claim he needs a real band. Hard to make that casual commitment sing, I guess.

Marital strife seems to have transformed Lowe from a power popper with brownout problems into the genre artist of roots eclectic he's always wanted to be. Slighter than ever lyrically and yet stronger overall than its two predecessors, this leads with a Tex-Mex something called ""Half a Boy and Half a Man,"" and that's where it means to stay.

For five years Lowe has marked time without ever quite losing the beat, and his most mild-mannered album of the decade is also his most consistent. I admit I missed the trademark sarcasm at first--until I realized that the most remarkable cut was a straightforward band-composed instrumental best described as mild-mannered Duane Eddy. Then I decided that the wimpy ""I Knew the Bride"" remake was deliberate--old beau Nick in the throes of fond regret--and went on from there. Will anybody notice this stirringly minor achievement? Probably not. Will I remember it myself a year from now? I wouldn't stake my job on it.

Another small victory in his longstanding battle against the irony that made him famous, and he sure ain't the only one--as they get older, guys who were smart enough to keep their distance as callow authenticity fans can't resist playing their hard-earned experience straight.

Bill O'Reilly, we salute you--for most of this record, you've inspired your favorite rapper to make good on his rationalizations. For once he's ribald rather than obscene, subversive rather than gratuitous, especially when he's attacking you and yours on ""Blow It Out Your Ass"" and ""Fuck You"" (official titles: ""Blow It Out"" and ""Screwed Up""). ""Splash Waterfalls"" examines the intimate links between fucking and making love; ""Pussy-Poppin' ""(official title: ""P-Poppin' "") is worthy of Dyke and the Blazers. But on track 13 (superstitious? me?), here comes the X-rated misogyny of ""Hoes in My Room,"" which Ludacris palms off on O'Reilly and I blame on hired dick Snoop Dogg. This disrupts the three-way that follows, after which Luda's losers shoot people for four minutes. Not in real life, of course.

This well-regarded Canadian folkie can't be the first to turn the yodeler's ""yo-de-lay-ee"" into the lover's ""you're the lady."" But I bet no one else has based a song cycle on the joke: the history of a marriage in which the pair build the house he celebrates with the preliminary climax of ""Now We Got a Kitchen."" Sad to say, the less auspicious climax that ends the record proceeds from ""Seems like you never wanted me around"" to ""Happy ever after's not the easy part."" But that doesn't mean they're finished any more than ""We're saving up for date night so we can have our fight"" meant they were in trouble when the monkeys were little. So I tell myself, anyway.

Having walked out on three different bands led by this dame, I have the credentials to certify this funny, sexy, accidental little record. Half the time she exaggerates her flat Cleveland accent into a hickish, dumb-and-dirty come-on or parody of same, and half the rest of the time she plays her foolish nihilist poetry for laughs, which leaves a quarter of the time when she's the nihilist fool I'll walk out on till the day she dies.

Lynn projects total empathy for the protagonist of the title song, a Topeka housewife who knows about women's oppression firsthand but regards ""women's lib"" as a glamorous media event, as distant as Liz's ""million-dollar pact."" An epochal two-and-a-half minutes, class-conscious in the great country tradition, and I don't care if it was written by a man (Shel Silverstein) who also works for Johnny Cash, Dr. Hook, and Playboy. What follows is an ordinary country album done right, avoiding banal covers and providing auxiliary songs of consistent interest. Lynn's ""L-O-V-E, Love,"" about talking dirty, is among the best, and there's not a bummer in the bunch. How many works of rock can you say that about these days?

I had hopes this might take its place beside one of my favorite country albums, Lefty Frizzell Sings the Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, but Patsy Cline's legacy is a lot narrower than Jimmie's, and Loretta's not quite the singer Frizzell was, either. At forty-one, her voice is thicker than Patsy's was when she died at thirty, and she's a lot more country, especially in her pronunciation--that slight lisp, and the way she distorts the vowels around ""r"" sounds. On the other hand, she has decent material to work with for once, and her ""Why Can't He Be You"" is a breathtaking object lesson in the connections between suffering and exaltation. Annoyance: the seven-minute spoken reminiscence that closes the album.

While the midrange emotions here are projected likably enough, they're nowhere near as powerful as on George and Tammy's best-of, perhaps because L&amp;C have never been a real-life couple. But this does offer fourteen virtually dudless tracks and includes four great ones--two blatantly comedic (""Spiders and Snakes"" and the classic ""You're the Reason Our Kids Are Ugly"") and two shamelessly bathetic (""The Letter"" and ""As Soon as I Hang Up the Phone,"" both graced by long passages of recitative).

Ronnie Van Zant may intend those bullets for ""pencil pushers"" (which means not only me but you, I'll bet) but that's no reason to shoot him down. In fact, it's just the opposite--his attraction has always been the way he gets his unreconstructed say. Unfortunately, the music could use some Yankee calculation--from Al Kooper of Forest Hills, who I figure was good for two hooks per album, and Ed King of New Jersey, the guitarist turned born-againer whose guitar fills carried a lot more zing than three doodooing Honnicutts.

Are these four rather Dollsish (Johansenish, really) tracks hard-rocking, or are they the platonic ideal of hard-rocking? A close call. Which is why I'm not convinced DMZ veteran Jeff Connolly makes up for his bad rep with inspired madness--either he's not inspired enough or he's not mad enough.

The talking drummer dominates three other percussionists on Maal's attempt to forge forward-looking pop from the rhythms of Senegal's Tukulor minority. Tricky, sometimes busy, with Maal's tenor cutting confidently through the crowd, it's closer to rock than soukous--funky sax here, lead guitar there, horn charts everywhere. It's also very much itself. Which gives you some idea of where one tradition-conscious African thinks the future must lie.

""I Don't Know"" was known to the Big Bopper, ""Poison Ivy"" was bad before bad knew its name, and ""You're a Fool"" is the only blues in history to employ the word ""sauerkraut"" in a simile. All three are recommended to the immediate attention of Mr. Buster Poindexter. Also, all three were released, unlike eight of the other cuts here. The unreleased stuff often score lyrically--Mabon's gift for hostile yet self-deprecating wit is in full display on ""I'm Tired"" and ""He Lied""--but relies on blues readymades.

Rapid rhymes, crisp enunciation, common-sense politics, and pop-weird dub give this English toaster the most auspicious U.S. debut of 1990--a best-of from all his just-U.S. released albums could be a meliorist Fear of a Black Planet or a socially responsible Mama Said Knock You Out. High points here include ""Coconut""'s African Methodist accent and a climactic third-world threefer. But the title tune isn't what it could have been.

And though the co-billed Lewis is big and original for an alt-beatmaker, his percussion-oriented version of an E Street Band, strings-swell-to-big-finish aesthetic has its icky moments. But as someone who shares Macklemore's moral views if not his equation of sincerity with soul, I find only the alcoholic's confession ""Neon Cathedral"" too much, and that one's counteracted by the relapser's confession ""Starting Over,"" just as ""Sayin' 'That's poetry, it's so well-spoken,' stop it"" counteracts his art talk. He's especially good on old cars and old clothes.

FALSE,B+,Mad Crush,Mad Crush,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17423,"
Because the guitar-bass-drums-violin as well as the vocals aren't so much subtle as mild, these seven love songs never work up the right pitch of emotional intelligence. But you still believe in your heart that John Elderkin and Joanna Sattin are a couple, because only a couple would notice these things? In the jocose ""My Pre-Existing Conditions"" Elderkin admits to two left feet, getting stuck in the past, needing to talk before bed, and there's more. In the pained ""Where Does It Hurt"" Sattin is so sick with ennui she asks only that he still be there in the morning. And he will be, because elsewhere they stay in bed, miss each other when they don't, and overnight a Christmas turkey on Amazon Prime so it'll be there for the Fourth of July.

FALSE,B+,Columbia Historic Edition,Maddox Brothers and Rose,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11460,"
These Alabama-born Californians wore pre-Nudie suits, called their music ""Okie boogie,"" and eventually settled in Hollywood, yet somehow little sister Rose is now a minor bluegrass icon who respects the verities for labels like Takoma and Arhoolie. I prefer her Hollywood. Admirers of the Morrells' cover of ""Ugly and Slouchy"" will have some idea how hot and funny ""The Hiccough Song"" and ""I've Got Four Big Brothers"" and their sendup of ""I've Got a Woman"" are. But when Rose puts heart and soul into ""Green Grow the Lilacs"" or ""Bringing In the Sheaves,"" I keep expecting one of her bros to break into a stage cackle, and it never happens.

FALSE,B+,One Step Beyond,Madness,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5398,"
We have entered the era of the white drummer--suddenly every young rock and roll band that touches vinyl can generate a moderately exciting pulse. Of course, Madness's pulse is exotic as well, and if at first I compared them to the Kingsmen, seeking fame and fortune by adding local color stories from the Portland bars to their repertoire of borrowed licks and melodies, that was mostly because it wasn't rock and roll enough. But after I heard more ska, lots more, the exoticism faded, and not just from exposure--I realized that a big problem with Afro-polka was that it didn't sound hip enough, and resisted. Anyway, Madness do it more rock and roll than anybody. Homy and bumptious, they're more purely fun than the most giddily self-conscious power pop.

FALSE,B+,Like a Prayer,Madonna,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2205,"
Three times I've mistaken her polymorphic promo and gross ambition for standard-issue lowest-common-denominator pandering, and three times her audience has disabused me in the months and years that followed. But though I swear I won't get fooled again, it's hard to hear an icon in the privacy of your own home, especially if you don't believe in her, and I won't sink that low or fly that high--I can't. So say the kiddie psychedelia is ick, the side-closers are over when they're over, and everything else sports some little touch to remember it by, Prince or musique concr������������������te or broken quote from the Association. The cocksucker's prayer is anybody's classic, but coming from, I don't know, Suzanne Vega, the declaration of filial independence and the recommendation of romantic independence would be uncharacteristically catchy cliches.

I prefer Erotica, the last time her shape-shifting audacity was more than a trope, and Music, the Mirwais-informed culmination of a period that could well last the rest of her career--could in the end be remembered as her career. Instead of playing at pop, using it as a platform from which to mount a fusillade of cultural challenges, she now is pop-blandness at its best, a model of a modern mental health, replete with ecumenical enlightenment, domestic contentment, liberal politics, and plenty of exercise. Not that she's limited to these themes; on the contrary, she role-plays as a matter of course, because (as she's long since established) that's what pop professionals do. And now it's time to sum up. So she gleans goodies from the overrated Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light, mixes in the glorious soundtrack-only ""Beautiful Stranger"" and the dismal soundtrack-only ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina,"" and hands it all over to Mirwais for sonic tweaking I'm not interested enough to pin down. An essential package.

She did make an album like this before: her debut, where she flitted so astutely between producers that fools took her for a casting-couch queen. But where Madonna had a distinct feel, disco that partook simultaneously of electro minimalism and pop sellout, it also had distinct parts. Here she subs out the flitting to producer Stuart Price, who digests the entirety of '80s dance music into a flow that subsumes all details and referents. If anything, it's more a dance record, leaving those of us with a sentimental weakness for distinct parts a little lost. So not only am I glad she rhymes ""New York"" and ""dork,"" I'm glad she put her kabbalist on the guest list.

In this Amerindie version of the Eurythmics, Stephin Merritt pulls Susan Anway's strings: where Annie would belt these metronomic tunes all the way to Vegas, Anway trills them in a sweet monotone and is grateful she can manage that. She's proud to play the puppet, which is a good thing because synthere thongwriter Merritt would drop her if she wasn't. First time out the literary brilliance of his doggerel lapped over into an obscurity his crude sonic eccentricities sometimes rendered unlistenable. Here he's learned to mesh straight pop parodies with well-turned, thought-through, not-quite-representational lyrics in which Anway usually plays a guy. Many are just mildly subversive love songs. But my favorite is so flat-out campy it could have been inspired by a Man From U.N.C.L.E. rerun.

Those who haven't already memorized Stephin Merritt's oeuvre will have to expend real effort acquiring a taste for him this late in the game, so they might as well experience the full glory of his eccentricity. The 6ths' album isn't just for his cult but by it, and Holiday may mislead the unwary into believing there's some warmth to him. This is where his dolorously impassive baritone and fugueing toy keyboards are at their most anonymous, original, tuneful, and forbidding. Since every single lyric mentions roads or trains, call it his concept album about escape, probably from himself. Even though it isn't where he rhymes ""Coney Island"" and ""prostitutes in Thailand,"" it's verbal enough to inspire willing workers to decipher the lyric sheet, and its sonic identity takes the Casio demo to unheard of extremes--like something conceived by a Martian who'd read about country music in The New Grove but didn't happen to own any guitars.

The concept is, not only do all these deadpan titles start with an i, they're performed (in alphabetical order!) by the deadpan I in question.  When the songs are not just clever but lively--most spectacularly on the unrelenting ""I Thought You Were My Boyfriend""--Stephin Merritt's demo-ready monotone could pass for a singing voice. When they're not--often not lively, and once or twice, heaven forfend, not clever--he sounds as if he's waiting to be swept off his feet by Sophie Von Otter. At which point we who were rooting for more ""I Thought You Were My Boyfriend"" sneak out the back door.

This relaxed, witty survey of musical Afro-America is strongest when its compositions verge on interpretations. You hear the steel drums on ""West Indian Revelation"" and realize that the foreign lilt of ""Chevrolet"" is Caribbean.

FALSE,B+,Between Nothingness and Eternity,Mahavishnu Orchestra,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7327,"
This live album is as rough as they're liable to get on record--I even hear a quote from ""Sunshine of Your Love,"" and the raveup on Jan Hammer's simple rock tune ""Sister Andrea"" is a ballbuster. Empty patches are inevitable but remarkably few. I'm beginning to wonder, though, how long McLaughlin can make his fusion work. Because this is jazz, McLaughlin and Cobham really do improvise (about the others I sometimes have my doubts). But because it's rock the notes and accents they play don't matter all that much--what communicates is the concept, which is mostly a matter of dynamics and which hasn't changed at all over three albums. Not that the improvisations count for nothing, or that striking new melodies--which are in short supply here--couldn't keep things interesting for quite a while. But it's not going to be automatic.

Recorded in the late '70s, with tough mgqashiyo mbaqanga out of favor among cultural as well as assimilationist blacks, this proves Mahlathini's staunch loyalty to the style he originated, his total lack of alternatives, or both. The notes say its ""refusal to compromise"" delivers ""Mahlathini at his very peak""; I say that without Makgona Tsohle and the Mahotella Queens it sounds almost as generic as late Toots, even though (and probably because) the man carries the lion's share of the music himself. But I'll add that the glosses make me wish I could follow along more closely. A city ""where women have got no mothers,"" a challenge to witch doctors, and a greeting to the spirit of his own youth all seem to transgress ever so slightly against the traditionalism that is mbaqanga's chief strength and most daunting limitation. Good.

Those personally offended by industrial-grade EDM, the gaggle of pop divas, or that dick Diplo will blame this record for purveying any or all of the three. Me, I'm a picker and chooser, hence grateful that said dick gave me a reason to enjoy Ellie Goulding and Ariana Grande, because good Lord I've tried, and to get closer to enterprising Jamaican-American Nyla and especially indie-pop strivers Wild Belle, whose hummed, crooned, and ultimately keened opener provides the perfect warmup for the harder stuff.

Well, though their core quota's a lot lower than Juluka's, we have heard guttier mbaqanga--on Rough Trade's Soweto, Earthworks's Zulu Jive.

Compounding once and future Iceberg Deke Leonard with two Help Yourselfers and the minimum quota of Williamses and Joneses, this is the best record to come out of San Francisco in quite a while, pretty impressive for a band that never saw the Golden Gate till after the thing was released. The chemistry's right, that's all--Leonard's eccentric dissonances and gullet-model wah-wah are sweetened by the Help Yourselfers and rolled with a steady rock by Williams and Jones. Unphilosophical but trenchant, short on tunes but chocked with riffs.

Manchester is very sexy in a barely disciplined, almost blowzy way--maybe a touch overexpressive, a little too liberal with her emotions. ""I Got Eyes"" is nice juicy fuck music and ""Stevie's Wonder"" the ultimate fan letter from someone who's found a new model of overexpressiveness. Both transcend the rest of the album, which in turn transcends the popped seams and middling Midlerizations of her first two LPs.

There's too much hippie about these guys--their gnarly neotribalism is so male that if they get big enough they'll pull the show-us-your-tits crowd like flies to patchouli. But they're a hoot attached to an ethnomusicology seminar, such dyed-in-the-wool wanderers that their Gypsy tramps and thieveries are like an organic bohemian tradition.

If side one makes it seem that reggae has turned into the rasta word for boogie--even to a Trenchtown tragedy recited with all the toughness of an imprecation against litter--the unimpassioned sweetness of most of side two sounds like a function of reflective distance, assured in its hard-won calm. Some of it's even better. The Haile Selassie speech recreated here as ""War"" is stump statesmanship renewed by a believer, and if the screams that open the second side don't curdle the corpuscles of the baldheads who are being screamed at, then dread is gone from the world.

As with so many black artists from this country, Marley's latest lyrics seem a little perfunctory, mixing vague politics of dubious depth with hackneyed romantic sentiments of dubious depth, and so what? Marley is not obliged to devote himself to propaganda. As with so many black artists from this country, the music is primary here, a message appropriate to his condition is conveyed by the unrushed rhythms and the way the sopranos share equally with the instruments and the new wariness of his phrasing and dynamics. Some of the cuts are flat, but if the O'Jays were to put five or six good ones on an LP--including two as striking as ""Jamming"" and ""So Much Things To Say""--we'd call it solid and enjoyable at least.

Neither his arty producers nor his Ethiopian band force the kind of cheer that wimped out his earlier crossovers, and his sharp, gritty singing replicates his old man's lower half even if the spiritual-romantic flights are beyond him. He's gotten less platitudinous, too, though as a prophet's scion he never invests Rasta doctrine with the authority of ideas struggled for--a black Jamaican cosmopolitan enough to voice sympathy for a ""white guy in love with black beauty"" sounds as priggish as any other puritan when he goes on about alcohol and processed foods.

Slowly--too slowly, but faster than we had any right to hope--he's getting it: if ""This generation will make the change"" doesn't convince, ""When will the innocent stop being punished for their innocence"" will certainly do.

Though many tout him as the big talent in the family (not counting Dad, of course), they're just making conversation: he's more fun for damn sure, but his artistic personality is still unformed.

As the first young jazz musician ever to enjoy true major-label promotion, Marsalis is trapped into selling an image whether he likes it (or admits it) or not. On the one hand, he inevitably attracts admirers who respond not to the substance he hawks so assiduously but to the idea of it, which makes me wonder whether they really thrill to the shadings and dynamics that up till now have constituted his genius. And on the other hand, those of us who can't stand his expensive tailoring and neoconservative pronunciamentos are tempted to dismiss the pleasures they insure. Listen hard enough and pleasures reveal themselves in profusion, but despite what Marsalis believes even their profusion isn't quite reason enough to bother, because in his wrongheaded determination to adjure the trendy and the obvious, he never lets loose. Most of us would say that inventing meaning while letting loose is the essence and promise of jazz. Neoconservatives wouldn't--maybe because they're not up to it.

At Material's best gigs Sonny Sharrock's aural grimaces challenge the impassively abrasive rhythm section; here Cliff Cultreri marches to bassist and drummer while Michael Beinhorn flatters Philip Glass.

Although his angular, slightly hyped-up groove on the instrument is distinctly his own, Bill Laswell is a typical bass player in the most important way: what he expresses depends on who he works with. Beyond drummer Fred Maher and synth threat Michael Beinhorn, his collaborators here include Fred Frith, Sonny Sharrock, and Henry Threadgill augmented by lesser avant-jazzmen. All obviously love the harsh, expansive intelligence of preschlock jazz- (and art-) rock. But their great ideas are rewarding rather than tempting, and they're not exalting either.

The male version of Laurie Anderson's Strange Angels is a marriage made in purgatory between two cold motherfuckers: Bill Laswell and Bill Burroughs. Seamlessly synthesizing new-age atmospherics, authentic African passion, and arena-rock dramaturgy, Laswell devises settings for the sci-fi ecopessimism of the greatest reader of our time. Not that it's all dead souls and dire consequences--for balance and to prove he can do it, Laswell also constructs an inspiriting third-world anthem from the remains of John Lydon's ""Poptones.""

Music box. Hurdy-gurdy. Pinball gallery. Turning point of silent movie. Between-innings entertainment at a minor-league ballpark. E Street pseudoclassical. Even, almost, ? and the Mysterians. That's how pop history is conceived by Kory Gardner. Words aren't quite irrelevant--cf. ""This is the whiner's bio,"" or ""Set the rocks on fire."" But they are ancillary.

FALSE,B+,Escape From '85,Spoek Mathambo,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16071,"
Insofar as I even know what these remixed hits from the year of Mathambo's Soweto birth are--""Like a Virgin,"" got it; ""Centipede,"" don't tell me you forgot Rebbie Jackson; ""Shikisha,"" must be Cape Town's Razz Brothers; ""We Can Dance,"" search me; ""Future,"" ditto--the resemblance is minimal, often based on some beat element DJs notice so we don't have to. All are transformed into rap-disco lite that bears Mathambo's Afropop-futurist stamp no matter who his collaborators. So airy it's perfect when you need a lift. Also so airy it threatens to float away altogether.

FALSE,B+,Curtis,Curtis Mayfield,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7371,"
Initially I distrusted these putatively middlebrow guides to black pride--""Miss Black America"" indeed. But a lot of black people found them estimable, so I listened some more, and I'm glad. Since Mayfield is a more trustworthy talent than Isaac Hayes, I wasn't too surprised at the durability of the two long cuts--the percussion jam is as natural an extension of soul music (those Sunday handclaps) as the jazzish solo. What did surprise me was that the whole project seemed less and less middlebrow as I got to know it. Forget the harps--""Move On Up"" is Mayfield's most explicit political song, ""If There's a Hell Below We're All Gonna Go"" revises the usual gospel pieties, and ""Miss Black America"" has its charms, too.

Wish the praises of God etc. weren't half in English, though I suppose the Prince's upwardly mobile platitudes go with his need to venture beyond his tribal tongue. Anyway, from this Nigerian popster the blandest platitude sounds blissfully gentle and upward mobility has a good sense of rhythm.

M'Benza promises ""the best of Paris"" for his state-of-the-tech Les Quatre Etoiles moonlight. Organ-synth, string-synth, drum-synth, supervoices, balafon, accordion--we get 'em all. And when the sweet male chorus inserts gruff commands, or M'Benza makes his soukous guitar hop mbira-style or sway like pedal steel, I'm willing to ignore the horns, which I swear come off some old Kassav' album.

FALSE,B+,Girl Going Nowhere,Ashley McBryde,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17282,"
The hot country news in tough country womanhood has enough attitude to stick it to every algebra teacher and Church of Christ deacon who ever looked down on her. But her multitude of good lines yields only two great songs: ""Livin' Next to Leroy,"" the first of what I hope will be many meth-and-opioid dark-siders genre-wide, where her cable-stealing role model ODs while she tokes up at her high school graduation to impress him, followed by ""A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega,"" the grittiest and most utopian of her four I said four road anthems. Like the socko endings she's both blessed and cursed with the voice for, her attraction to this self-replicating subgenre makes me hope that the success she's earned leaves her free to do more with her rosy future than big it up.

FALSE,B+,Prairie in the Sky,Mary McCaslin,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2296,"
I consider it just that the most convincing cowboy-based music in years should come from a woman who starts off with this request: ""Pass me by if you're only passing through."" The voice is high and lonesome, not given to gush; the instrumentation is built around an acoustic guitar, but accommodates a single French horn, a drumset, or both, when appropriate; the songs--both borrowed and original--are a lesson to L.A. cowboys everywhere from an L.A. cowgirl who makes her records in Vermont.

FALSE,B+,Old Friends,Mary McCaslin,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2297,"
Side two begins brilliantly, seguing from ""My World Is Empty Without You"" to ""The Wayward Wind,"" two unjustly forgotten chestnuts from disparate traditions that are freshened immeasurably by McCaslin's eccentric, exacting mountain style. But ""Blackbird,"" which leads to a charming ""Don't Fence Me In,"" has been overrecorded, and the finale--the title cut and sole original--is flat. Side one's three highlights are nice enough, but ""Oklahoma Hills"" doesn't live up to Arlo's, much less Woody's, and ""Pinball Wizard"" is a weird, brave mistake. In short, the interpreter's dilemma--attagirl, but no cigar.

Any old boy who can get arrested for ""cuttin' up some honky with that bone-handled knife"" has earned this perfect new-rockabilly title. But as you might expect, he has more to say in the action-packed tales of adventure (""Honky Tonkin',"" ""Morgan City Fool"") than when he's trying to prove he's a grownup (""Lesson in the Pain of Love,"" ""Troubled Woman"").

FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Mel McDaniel,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8242,"
McDaniel's marginal distinction doesn't depend on the marginal cleverness of songsmiths, but if his hits don't equal his high points, they're not his low points either. ""Hello Daddy, Good Morning Darling"" is a heart-tugger that would work for anybody from Ronnie Milsap to George Strait, but his commercial specialty is the mild raunch of ""Louisiana Saturday Night,"" ""Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On,"" and ""Stand Up,"" where he invites all the mild raunch fans to testify and tempts non-believers to forgive ""Do You Want to Say Goodbye.""
"
FALSE,B+,Last Straw,Chuck McDermott and Wheatstraw,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7390,"
As befits a Yale dropout, McDermott makes country music with an edge of educated subtlety--the comic sendups of cars and compulsive consumption sound quite a bit more political than Jerry Reed's, the forlorn laments a whole lot more existentialist than George Jones's. Yet Jerry Reed and George Jones are definitely the comparison: McDermott may sound a little like Phil Ochs or Keith Carradine in their country personas, but his voice is stronger and more country. The drawback is the ragged backup from Boston's finest, who sound like folkies who have not yet developed any viable equivalent for slickness.

Though it enabled her to waltz off with the Country Music Association's artist-of-the-year award in her gender division, this longtime up-and-comer's second MCA album may pass outsiders right by. Its vaunted neotraditionalism is long on detail work--a thick hillbilly accent so soft-spoken it never intrudes, songcraft so steeped in the canon it splits the difference between evocation (side one) and clich������������������ (side two). Those who miss the good old days are advised to think of her as Tammy Wynette with"
FALSE,B+,The Best of Reba McEntire,Reba McEntire,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2903,"
I'll take this benighted distillation over what we've heard of her kind of country, mostly because it's a distillation (from 1980-1983, when she was on her way to neoclassicism). Donna Fargo at her cheeriest couldn't get away with the keynoting ""(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven,"" the Platters cover would be useless even without the strings, and ""My Turn"" is sexy-gal at its most repulsive (""You have reached the woman in me through the man in you,"" she notes as she offers the guy a blow job). But songs like ""I Don't Think Love Ought to Be That Way,"" ""I'm Not That Lonely Yet,"" and ""You're the First Time I've Ever Thought About Leaving"" group around the same sexually self-possessed persona and would stand out on any album she has in mind. Jerry Kennedy rarely overdoes the schlock. And though the voice has less character, it's also less sedate.
"
FALSE,B+,High Time,MC5,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7393,"
At its best, this combines the anarchic energy of John Sinclair's album with the pop control of Jon Landau's album. ""Sister Anne"" is a passionate farewell to a Catholic boyhood, and the jazz climax, however ill-conceived sonically (the horns sound funny after all those guitars), gets where it's going, fast. Mistake: ""Miss X,"" an atrocious fuck-me-babe ballad. Some things they'll never learn.

FALSE,B+,Pronto Monto,Kate & Anna McGarrigle,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1889,"
The blandout of this quiet but piquant duo is being blamed on producer David Nichtern's all-too-steady hand. And sure, I'd prefer tempos that deviated more than five degrees from dead ahead and tasty licks that didn't whisper monosodium glutamate. But I also expect that these tough, smart women consented readily enough to his devices, especially as their own songwriting now aspires to a sweet directness that Nichtern himself is better at (compare his ""Just Another Broken Heart"" to Anna's ""Oh My Heart"" or Kate's ""Come Back Baby""). And I'll trade you Ann's ""Bundle of Sorrow, Bundle of Joy"" for the next Maria Muldaur album sound unheard.

FALSE,B+,From the Blue Eagle,Bat McGrath,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7394,"
Unlike so many singer-songwriters, McGrath sounds like he comes from somewhere--upstate New York, as it happens. Instead of attaching generalized reflections to the most surefire melodies available, he writes lyrics that evoke specific locales and situations--like Jimmy Buffett when he's good, or Tom T. Hall with a more literary flair. Granted, anyone who believes a wino is ""free"" should check in his thesaurus under ""nothin' left to lose,"" but the abundant compassion, humor, and detail of these brief ballads make you want to hear them again. A small find.

FALSE,B+,Start Breathing,The McGuires,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5438,"
With hundreds of other bands working out imperceptible variations on songform, usually by admixing noise or roots or exoticism, the McGuires aim to do nothing new, and since they have the gift of song to begin with, that's a plus. Oh, they do call their friendly sound ""barbecue-beat,"" but there's no petty territoriality here, no minute formalism expressing selves that are barely worth the trouble. Just middle-class rock-and-rollers voicing their middle-class disaffection with a measure of lyric grace. I'm fond of ""T.V. Party"" (they're not going), ""Let You Down"" (and apologize in advance), and ""She's a Lawyer"" (""Sorry, sister, she's not gay""). You may like the one about the prophet Elijah.

FALSE,B+,Massachusetts,Lori McKenna,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16846,"
The statistics are pretty stark. Six songs (1-5-6-7-9-12) fairly astonishing and six (2-3-4-8-10-11) more country-generic; the same six bare and direct and guitar-colored, the others hook-cushioned and keyboard-reliant; the same six--this is the tell--credited solely to McKenna, the others all co-written. Not that the co-writes don't do Nashville's assembly-line tradition fairly proud. But comparatively they're gooey and mechanical--it's a downer when the thought-through details of ""Smaller and Smaller"" resolve into generalized nostalgia, when the quiet sanity of ""Shouting"" builds to a rousing chorus. And not only does the material no one else touched have more bite, it tracks: where 1-5 are brutal breakup songs, 7-9-12 make more of long love than Nashville generally has the brains for. So it's ""You ain't worth the spit in my mouth/When I scream out your name"" and ""Make every word sting/Make every word bleed/Until I'm not gonna want to love you anymore"" to ""Every time you walk away from me you come running back/How romantic is that?"" and ""You whispered something in my ear last night/Some years ago you wouldn't have thought to."" And then there's a happy ending: ""Grown Up Now."" It's about her oldest kid.

FALSE,B+,The Tree,Lori McKenna,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17354,"
No one tills the themes of marriage, family, and the passage of time as fruitfully as McKenna. But although both the opening ""A Mother Never Rests"" and ""The Tree"" itself are so well-put it would be simple-minded to slot them as cliches, their roots in truism run so deep that their considerable portion of actual truth will probably escape nonbelievers. The sole masterstroke is ""The Fixer,"" where a handyman fears all his ginger ale on the nightstand and keys to locks long departed will never ease his wife the fighter's . . . pain? fear? anger? depression? We don't know, and maybe he doesn't either. So be glad ""You Won't Even Know I'm Gone"" and ""You Can't Break a Woman"" on marriage and ""People Get Old"" and ""Young and Angry Again"" on the passage of time are close enough to masterstrokes themselves.

FALSE,B+,Duck Rock,Malcolm McLaren,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12188,"
McLaren knows how to record African music for Western ears, and the ebullient tunes he's collected here more than make up for his annoyance quotient. But the intrusions of the World's Famous Supreme Team, not to mention the featured vocalist, are annoying nevertheless. And when ""Song for Chango,"" which has existed since ""before Jesus Christ was born,"" gets credited like almost all the other compositions to Malc and producer Trevor Horn, I wish he'd thought to mention which specific Africans contributed to which specific tracks. Culture may be collective, but (in this culture) wealth ain't.

FALSE,B+,Fans,Malcolm McLaren,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10300,"
Although what attracts McLaren to opera is proven commercial tunes he doesn't have to pay for, he does end up making sly, slantwise connections between two wildly successful strains of romantic superschlock: Puccini and disco. ""Madam Butterfly"" has the killer hook, with McLaren's Pinkerton a bizarre yet rather affecting country-cockney hybrid. But the great genre-fuck is ""Fans"" itself, with disco diva Angie B. doing a recitative so dumb and charming it reminds us not only that you don't need brains to love opera but that this may well be the nicest thing you can say about the stuff. Listen to Angie stumble over a few notes of real Puccini in the coda, then ask yourself whether featured soprano Betty Ann White would improve them by doing them right.

In which the top musicians in fusion are gathered by the man who made it all possible to show the genre off aesthetically--no funk vamps, no one-run solos, no twaddle about the harmony of the universe. The project has a certain stillborn aura--it doesn't swing a lot, there is a reliance on Speedy Gonzalez climaxes, and snatches of such deathless melodies as ""Holiday for Strings"" and ""Mohammed's Radio"" are audible. Still, repetitiousness is minimized, and there are good ideas and lots of sensitive interaction. And it didn't sell diddley.

Recorded in New York in 1969, when McLaughlin's studio appearances were amazing everyone from Jimi to Buddy to Miles, this prefigures Mahavishnu's fusion at an earlier, jazzier stage. Pretty intense. The rock guy (drummer Martin) sounds a lot more original than the jazz guys (keyboard player Berger and--especially--saxophonist Surman), but only the justifiably ubiquitous Holland (on bass) can keep up with McLaughlin. And believe me, even if in historical fact it's McLaughlin who's trying to keep up, that's how it sounds.

No longer a minimalist, she layers samples (""Rockin' It""! Millie Jackson!) and backtalk like a pro, sometimes like an original--the rhythmic obscenities on the spectacularly unsisterly ""Shut the Eff Up! (Hoe)"" are mind-boggling. Her tales of the drug wars are tough and prowoman, and the narrative tone of ""Cappucino""--part fable, part metaphor, part confessional revery, part dumb it-was-only-a-dream--is avant-garde. Elsewhere she's a pro.

FALSE,B+,Too Long in the Wasteland,James McMurtry,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5441,"
He's gonna be a prestige item, just you wait--quality singer-songwriter from the heartland-wasteland. He's been there, he's still there, has his own RFD box on the back cover lest you doubt his authenticity. Also an eye for detail, perhaps from his novelist dad, and John Mellencamp showing him around the studio. I enjoy his sketches, their weary women especially. But like so many singer-songwriters and so many local-colorists, he tends to a soft fatalism, especially when he tries a big statement: the metametaphorical ""Painting by Numbers,"" or ""I'm Not From Here,"" which notes that we've been picking up and leaving ""since the stone age."" No way a simple quality singer-songwriter can change that, now is there?

Those who want blues from the 12th Street and Vine will enjoy McShann's album with T-Bone Walker (on Classic Jazz). This is something else--Kansas City jazz rendered by an instrumental ensemble that never gets bigger than the mid-'70s Rolling Stones. And although I'm no aficionado of the horn chart, I enjoy the interplay of instrumental colors on standards by Waller, Basie, Ellington, and McShann.

""Streets of London,"" a gentle attack on folkie self-pity, is one of the several appealingly melodic urban miniatures, and it doesn't stop there. McTell is so softhearted he ought to check in with a cardiologist (maybe that's why he sounds so sad all the time), but he's not empty-headed; he knows what his world-view portends. Hence, ""First and Last Man,"" a celebration of a real primitive--the epoch isn't identified, but I'd guess Neanderthal. So why is he in the studio with Gus Dudgeon? Beats me, but it doesn't hurt.

Both sides are unimpeachably sensible and unfailingly pleasant; except for the closer, each of the ten tunes paces proudly by in full confidence that it will set you humming. Yet as reported, the proceedings are a little, shall we say, somnolent, which I blame not just on a voice whose deep satisfactions are best appreciated in the company of brighter and flightier ones but on a drummer who isn't Mick and a bassist who isn't John.

This vocal trio from Chattanooga was recorded by Brad Shapiro in Miami and Muscle Shoals for a Fort Lauderdale-based Atlantic subsidiary.

Furious negativist then, goofy nature mystic now, Curt Kirkwood is the David Thomas of endearing sloppiness. The tunes unfold loosely and sweetly, with Curt's guitars not so much chiming as chattering in a nonchalantly unstylish take on neofolk lyricism. But the music's charms are a little too flaccid to hold up the most unabashedly lysergic worldview yet to emerge from postpunk.

FALSE,B+,Out Our Way,Meat Puppets,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5445,"
In a time when EPs register microdistinctions among white bohemians, not to mention professionals, this is one piece of product that's more than a holding action in musical strength and commercial strategy. It's a departure, toward a less spacy, more bottomy hardcore-gone-folkloric. It covers ""Good Golly Miss Molly"" at a speed approximating that of the original--which was considered fast in its time, believe me.

This post-prison freedom cry is a 19-track marathon whose beats rise and fall while a solid third of its rhymes expand on Mill's unsought status as a case study in the racism of the parole system. If only it didn't also return tediously to the females he's fucked, who by actual count occasion almost 90 reps of the slurs ""bitch"" and ""hoe,"" five times as many as the affectionate ""shawty""/""girl""/""mami."" He does at least seem to savor their bodies sometimes, which is never a given. But he sounds far more motivated pointing out that that's rapper cash not dealer cash before Jay-Z unfurls his deepest billionaire brag to date, or delivering the hard hood truths of ""Oodles O' Noodles Babies."" And ""100 Summers"" builds to a quatrain that identifies and then contextualizes the enemy within: ""Grew up 'round them monsters they'll shoot you in your face / Ain't used to showin' no love that's 'cause we grew up in that hate / Live by the sword die by the sword way / Tried to make it home they shot him in the hallway.""

Marking time and maybe taking a small, honorable profit in the bargain, they heat up the remixed title tune to accompany (surprise) a Gram Parsons cover and two originals: a typically realistic, typically depressive response to the miners' strike, and a typically commonplace, typically grim letter from a woman who should have blown the whistle on her dad.

Nobody would take them for amateurs or anarchists on this evidence. Just a catchy, rocking Brit country band with more enthusiasm than skill in the vocal department and lyrics-included that don't seem to have much to do with honky-tonks--that tend overmuch to the metaphysical, metaphorical, and obscure for all their show of specificity. I await the next phase.

Reports that they've ""gone reggae"" are grossly exaggerated and no big deal--the Bellamy Brothers beat them to that crossover by a country mile, and the skank that kicks things off is as lovable as anything they've ever done (bumbling semipros they may be, but their drummer used to work for the Rumour). If only they were hip enough to cover ""Old Hippie"" (that's a Bellamys song, kids), all would be well. As it is they cover (some would claim redefine) ""Heart of Stone"" and write bookish lyrics I don't understand even when I've read the authors in question.

FALSE,B+,I Love Mekons,The Mekons,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3716,"
Right, love songs, laid out casually across disc and lyric sheet--a country album without a happy ending. Jon and Tom are too cynical, but they're not too callow, so their scenarios generate recognizable permutations of lust if not ecstasy, emotion if not devotion, and when Sally Timms sings about that ""Millionaire,"" they sound like the great old pros they are. Too often, though, love just doesn't seem like their subject--the only time the music achieves carnal knowledge of the message is on the sarcastic ""Special"" and the confused ""I Don't Know.""

This acoustic group-sing had me hedging like a derivatives trader when it came out--until I observed eight humans called Mekons sit around grousing and banging on tour. Dressed like the wraith of a ska boy and dancing like a drunken undertaker, die-hard Londoner Tom Greenhalgh especially made these death songs come alive--not just Tom's dismal opener and Jon Langford's can't-come climax and everybody's desert prophecy, but the animal fables, the mystery history, the agricultural workers' carouse, the unplugged teeter-totter for the digital age. If you don't know much about these 30-year veterans except that they're legendary, this probably isn't where to find out why. If you have any idea what I'm talking about, however, partake.

Unlike my straightlaced friends, I've always dug the idea of Melanie--Edith Piaf as Brooklyn waif, preaching the hippie gospel in that absurdly flexible and resonant alto. But I've found the reality cloying. Here she grows up just enough. ""Brand New Key"" is one of those impossible celebrations of teen libido that renew one's faith in AM radio. ""Steppin'"" is the best breakup song since ""It's Too Late,"" and though side two slips badly toward the end, she's rarely a simp this time out.

Having long wondered what gave this longtime Bowie stablemate the right to speak for the average guy, I've decided it's his talent, which is pretty damn average. That's okay, because the success ratio here, a nice average fifty-fifty or so, just goes to show you what sincerity, hard work, and modest ambitions can do. Mellencamp has half outgrown the fatalism that always underlined the predictability of his Stonesish bandmates, who've gotten tougher with age, an encouraging sign in rich musicians. I wish I knew (I wish he knew) exactly what ""Justice and Independence '85"" is trying to say. But I'll take ""You've Got to Stand for Something"" at face value.

The lead singer's name is Theodore Pendergrass, not Harold Melvin, which you'd only know by reading Soul or Jet--he's not mentioned anywhere on the record or double-fold jacket. Pendergrass boasts just about the most powerful voice ever to hit soul music, though not the richest or most overwhelming. Although his smashes are dance tunes like ""The Love I Lost"" and ""Satisfaction Guaranteed,"" his real calling is big ballads, especially ones that assert dependence--""Is There a Place for Me,"" ""I'm Weak for You."" But did they have to kick things off with ""Cabaret""?

Black suffering above the poverty level is the lyrical twist of ""Bad Luck"" and ""Where Are All My Friends"" (written not by Gamble-Huff but by Carstarphen-McFadden-Whitehead), and to Pendergrass's credit he seems to get it--even makes a few asides. He also generates tremendous romantic authority--you really believe he wants to meet up with her ""Somewhere Down the Line."" He doesn't do the impossible for ""Pretty Flower,"" though, and given the credibility of most of what remains--not to mention the intrusion of the mysterious Sharon Paige--the impossible is all that would push this over the line for me.

FALSE,B+,Wake Up Everybody,Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7420,"
The sustained dynamics of the title track get me past its muddle-headed lyrics--Gamble-Huff sometimes act as if ""hatred, war an' poverty"" came along just as they were running out subjects. And I can still go along with Teddy Pendergrass's tender strength. But sometimes he sounds a little more insecure than I think he intends--he's prone to bluster and chest-pounding, and some of his grunts are almost coughs. Anyway, he's gone.

FALSE,B+,At the Chelsea Nightclub,The Members,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7421,"
The inheritors of English punk haven't turned to power pop; they're putting their energies into reggae. Britain's own indigenous black music, with the r&amp;b syntheses of the Stones rather than the blues imitations of the Savoy Browns serving as precedent. The crude feel and committed socioeconomic awareness of this album recall 1977, but the rhythms and tempos leave room for their rebellious-suburban-lad-escaped-to-the-city to give forth with a slyer kind of humor.

FALSE,B+,Business as Usual,Men at Work,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5456,"
They call Australia Oz because it's about as exotic as Kansas upside down, and these five sturdy-sounding, fragile-down-under blokes make the most of it. Ten thousand miles from the heart of darkness they're free to project honest, ordinary, low-level Anglo-Saxon anxiety, with enough transpositions of key and meter to establish that they've thought about it some. Call the music auxiliary Police, with more players and fewer dynamics. The words aspire to a bland compassion that sings its origins in the vaguely rebellious ""Be Good Johnny,"" about a schoolboy who ""only like[s] dreaming,"" and justifies its universalism by finding Australians everywhere from Brussels to Bombay.

As benign an evolutionary mishap as the koala bear, this displaced pub-rock band does its level best to act friendly and crazy despite disheartening life experiences. Along the way, keybman Greedy Smith sings Roy Orbison's ""Workin' for the Man"" like Dave Edmunds couldn't dream it, and headman Martin Plaza enlists his mates in the impossible task of closing the Nick Lowe gap.

A follow-up to There's a Riot Goin' On by a group identified as ""Black Mer-Da"" on the disc itself, before someone at Janus got cold feet. No more riots here than with Sly, or course--just self-hate, misogyny, desperate poverty, and senseless violence, as out-of-tune voices declaim strangely catchy tunes over loitering funk patterns and jagged guitar. ""Sometimes I wish I'd never been born,"" they announce flatly, and they can really get flat. But the most surreal passage comes toward the close of ""My Mistake,"" when ""I should have killed her instead"" (author's note: of the friend he caught fucking her), horrifying enough as a surprise endline, is transformed into a little piece of art-funk, repeated amid various instrumental configurations by an off-key chorale that sounds positively transported.

FALSE,B+,Struttin',The Meters,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7424,"
The New Orleans M.G.'s swing, but not smoothly, the way a big band does--their Caribbean lilt is pure second-line, as elliptical as a saint's march. They're the secret of Allen Toussaint-produced hits by Lee Dorsey, Aaron Neville, and Ernie K-Doe, and because they put out riffs rather than songs their own LPs are consistently danceable and listenable. Of course, to do better than that the band would have to come up with more good riffs in a year than most rhythm sections manage in a decade, and usually they compromise a little--only two r&amp;b hits here, plus several other tracks that might have been, ""Wichita Lineman"" not among them.

Although it's worth noting that their first hit for Warners, ""Hey Pocky A-Way,"" is as old as the second line, it's also worth nothing that they're getting results from their experiments--namely, the twelve-minute funk fusion ""It Ain't No Use."" And if most of the time the vocals are neutral at best, what this bunch of amateurs makes of ""Just Kissed My Baby"" isn't dreamed of in Three Dog Night's philosophy.

Outside of New Orleans the Meters are a cult band. All they accomplish by going pop/disco is the loss of their critical rep (whatever that's worth) and the erosion of their sales base. Yet leaving Allen Toussaint for David Rubinson was evidently the right move--he respected them so much he was even sparing with the Tower of Power. A very good commercial funk record, right down to covers that go with their natural beat--one from Peter Tosh and one from Allen Toussaint.

The fact that this was overrated as part of the same extra-musical chain reaction that caused Maya to be underrated doesn't mean it was merely well-timed and, as they say, well-played. It takes a while to congeal, but for fans there's spice aplenty in the skinny beats-for-their-own-sake that dominate a first half whose most memorable line is ""try to outschool us so we jump on our scooters"" (on ""WWW/Meds/Feds"" seven minutes in, and FWIW the Wikipedia times are 40 seconds off on my version). But after ""Vicki Intermission"" come three consecutive songs that'll make you madder than you were already that the artiste thought it provocative, as they say, to leave the album untracked: the well-hooked ""Gen -N-E-Y"" followed by ""Bad Girls"" and ""Marsha/Britney."" Theme statement: ""You can have my money but you can't have me."" Whether she's singing it for her penniless sisters or her affluent self is impossible to tell. That's why they call her provocative. Also, um, controversial.

As everybody but avant-bigots knew from hearing Wham! on the radio, Michael can prove that photogenic and popwise aren't mutually exclusive while combing his hair with his left hand. Substance, depth, simple human decency--that kind of stuff is more problematic. So the show of soul, in the grain of the lyrics as well as the voice, makes a difference. But let no one forget that the vulnerability and compassion here purveyed are staple commodities of the truly popwise, and that the album's only conceptual coup, ""I Want Your Sex,"" stands as an ambiguous publicity stunt worthy of Madonna herself.

People say I sound like a baby, but I'm a hundred per cent woman,"" she chirps on ""Special Thanks,"" most of them tendered to the usual sexist suspects surrounding her producer and guest rapper, N.W.A.'s Dr. Dre. A rapper she's not--like Bobby Brown or Al B. Sure, she's a singer in a rap world, and though her voice is less surprising when she doesn't talk, she gets the decibels up there even with her warble set on squeal. She can liquefy like Chaka or Teena, too, which is impressive even though neither songstress could get away with these slow ones. The fast ones hint at what an L.A. woman has to do to get the sexist suspects to stop calling her a bitch with the tape running--act half-nice, half-nasty (in a word, ""Nicety""), and assume real love is her prerogative.

Side two does seven great songs with umpteen instruments in just over fifteen minutes, a perfectly amazing miracle of concision. But side one is less than hot. Two (why two?) just-wrong Johnny Mercer songs lead into a properly excessive intro to Ann Peebles's ""Breaking Up Somebody's Home"" that is destroyed inside of two minutes by an improperly excessive, funkless production. Bette's overstatement works on ""Surabaya Johnny"" and ""I Shall Be Released,"" but I've heard better. Most important, why isn't there one song by a contemporary composer here? Dylan doesn't count--I'm talking about Randy Newman, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Joni Mitchell, maybe James Taylor or Cat Stevens, she's always made me believe in miracles. As it stands, this record is perilously close to the ostrich nostalgia of her dumbest fans.

After not figuring out who Peter Garrett sounded like (sotto voce Roger Waters slightly, Peter Gabriel not at all, Peter Hammill not really, David Bowie what else is new), I decided his animadversions were in fact generic, and not in a bad way--he hectors like a crank politician would hector if the politician were a rock singer. Since this rock singer is in fact a crank politician, his authenticity requirement is thus satisfied. Nor is it a bad thing that his band is hooking it up these days. Garrett remains irritating even as you start singing along in spite of yourself, which is all anyone can ask of a crank.

FALSE,B+,The Very Best of the Mighty Clouds of Joy,Mighty Clouds of Joy,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7436,"
This two-disc set presents the pre-crossover Peacock-label gospel and the ""appeal to Pop/R&amp;B audiences"" as a continuum, and while I'm still a fan of the Clouds' first Dave Crawford LP, guess which period sounds better. Is it the formal purity of the Peacock stuff, leaving the excitement to Joe Ligon's falsetto-piercing shouts, that makes their sermonizing seem so unpresumptuous? Or does the music just go with the message, as in the overbearing orchestrations of the more recent ""God Is Not Dead"" and ""Look on the Bright Side""? One thing I know--gospel songs are written by mortals, too, and all the faith in the world isn't going to make a good one out of a bad one. An acceptable one, maybe.

As on so many reggae albums, songs that sound flat at first sink in if given the chance. But reggae's simple melodic devices are wearing so thin that this isn't always a plus--I resisted the title cut even more stubbornly once I remembered how it went, and the old political messages remind me more and more of Sunday school. Nevertheless, I remain basically interested until the middle of side two, with special curiosity as to the current whereabouts of ""King Kong.""

These guys sure can rap and rhyme, and they do. But whether they're up to scripting comic books I'll leave to the experts. Continuity by Headnodic and his Quannum-channels-Too-Short funk.

The Afro-Chicano love man front-loads his Prince-channeling debut album: five hooky tracks--two romantic ones linked by an ambivalent interlude to one about a prostitute and another about a quickie--followed by six pleasant tracks and capped by two hooky novelties, the second of which delights immatoorly in the old ""piece""-""peace"" homonym. But there's a treasure hidden in the middle. With supplicant's songs rare enough in a genre that makes its nut promising untold pleasures, ""Teach Me"" is unprecedented, laying out the truth that, as Norman Mailer put it in one of the few useful sex tips in his orgasm-mad canon, ""the man as lover is dependent upon the bounty of the woman."" Who knows what pleases her? She does, she alone, and Miguel craves to be let in on that shifting and enthralling secret. If only he'd hung a top-drawer melody on the sucker he'd have a ""Use Me"" or ""Sexual Healing"" he could sing forever.

Macon meets New Orleans in Glasgow for a lesson in Scots soul, historical division. Allen Toussaint provides the New Orleans, but though his songs (""Brickyard Blues,"" yeah) certainly stand out, he doesn't hog the stage--Miller's rough warmth and knowledge of literature keep the album in play.

Miller had never impressed me with Inner Circle on Capitol, so I put aside this solo effort without much pain. Then an adept suggested I flip the loudness switch and turn up the bass and treble--advice that applies to all of Tom Moulton's reggae remixes for U.S. UA. Boom--different music. The Rasta homilies area little thin and the remakes of ""Why Can't We Be Friends"" and ""Dock of the Bay"" unnecessary, but ""Tenement Yard"" is neither, and I love Miller's basic vocal trick, which makes him sound like a kid imitating a machine gun. The adept tells me Inner Circle sounds better in Jamaican too.

FALSE,B+,The Dreamer,Rhett Miller,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15690,"
Miller fashions his excellent tunes within such a narrow melodic compass that it always takes too long for the new ones to get sorted, and the Nashville-trad self-production on his fourth solo album doesn't sharpen their outlines much. But as usual the songs come clear eventually, starting with a Ben Kweller collab bearing the aptly ominous title ""Lost Without You."" It's not the winner here because the lyric could be stronger, which cannot be said of ""Complicated Man"" or ""As Close as I Came to Being Right,"" not to mention the miserable ""Out of Love."" Consider those titles. That's why I said ominous.

Miller's eccentricity--James Cotton harp amid the Sam Cooke amid the technologized ditties--has no center or even epicenter except for the pastoral antimaterialism so common among exurbanite rock tycoons. But in the end his borrowed hooks and woozy vocal charm are an irresistible formula. Finds good covers, too--""Mercury Blues"" (copyright 1970 by K.C. Douglas, whoever he is) fits right in.

I know I'm not supposed to say this, but I've never bought Mingus as Great Jazz Genius--Important Jazz Eccentric is more like it, I'd say, especially in his more ambitious compositions. The 27-minute title fantasia is rich, lively, irreverent, and enjoyable, but it's marred by overly atmospheric Hollywood-at-the-carnival moments, while the kitschy assumed seriousness of ""Music for 'Todo Modo'"" almost ruins its fresh big-band colors.

Alain Jourgenson is said to hate Steve Albini, and why not, but I still think Big Black changed his life. Whomp whomp whomp whomp, these huge ugly slabs of beat are like the metal of dreams, all urban din and therapeutic brain damage, only done with synthesizers. Though I wish I knew what they were bellowing about down in the abyss, this will tone up your innards a lot more efficiently than whatever's hep in garage grunge these days.

Industrial's edge on metal is anonymity--unlike major-brand sonic barrage, it presents itself as resultant rather than expression, music/noise emanating from a society/culture. It's objective; it doesn't imply a subject. This illusion boosts the music/noise's impact and authority while rendering it virtually indistinguishable from itself (as well as difficult to access from what's human/humanist in our aesthetic sense). The bestselling Chicago version gets faster and purer with every release. Even when Alain Jourgenson raps, or apes (hires?) John Lydon, I could give a fuck who he is or what he thinks. Which is essential to the intended sensation.

Play this back-to-back with Minott's 1979 Black Roots and then tell me reggae never changes. The progress is subtle, but I promise you'll hear it plenty clear enough. It begins as usual in the rhythms, which Sly &amp; Robbie take over from lesser lights, but that doesn't explain why Minott, a creamy lovers rocker of no special distinction, not only keeps up but adds fillips of his own, fillips that would have been buried in the 1979 recording even if he'd been capable of them then. Sure the songwriting's improved too, but in this kind of music meaning inheres in responsive interaction. If formalism it must be, let it be formalism of the body.

Where at first this seemed to prove that irrepressibly avant-garde bands are catchier when they don't set out to ""write hit songs,"" now it's obvious that the commershal concept is total rather than part joke--only the trumpet parts (horns symbolize sellout to punks, maybe because they're so hard to play) mark a significant departure. Songs are catchy enough, too, with the catchiest lasting eight minutes including six-minute outro. Very mersh.

From ""A Heart Disease Called Love,"" a John Cooper Clarke setting that might have been plucked from the bowels of Nashville, through ""Glad"" and ""Hey , Lucky,"" first side's new studio songs aren't what you'd call glad--more like mournful, angry, and depressive.

Right, he has played and may yet again play drums in Fleet Foxes, whose beat means so much to us all. But that's not the good part, for goodness sake. The good part is that, under the influence of organic psychedelics and the American road, he figured out how to deploy words, as in the deathless couplet: ""And I'm writing a novel! Because it's never been done before!"" Whereupon, presumably, he also figured out that novels were a losing proposition. And though he dumbs up his songwriting half the time by fearing fun literally as regards forward motion, don't give up. Beyond ""I'm Writing a Novel"" itself, the four best tracks are the four last tracks, where he picks up the tempo and looks fun in the eye. He could use a more outgoing drummer, though.

The 305 canonical English and Scottish ballads are obviously good tunes--time-tested, one might say. And these seven are pretty much unchanged, too. Yet subtle fiddle, accordion, pump organ, and especially bass liven up the acoustic guitars just a touch, and both Mitchell's fluting, childlike lead and Hamer's mellower follow avoid purist sanctity as well as modernizing pizzazz. If only I could swear the presentation is so beguiling I keep the plots in mind. But I will say that the two about mean parents thwarting true love speak more directly to my spirit and conscience than the one about the fine lords going down on their very own Titanic, and point out that what saves the princess-laying Willie of Winsbury is he's R-I-C-H rich.

Album eight is most impressive for the cunning with which Mitchell subjugates melody to the natural music of language itself. Whereas in the past only her naive intensity has made it possible to overlook her old-fashioned prosody, here she achieves a sinuous lyricism that is genuinely innovative. Unfortunately, the chief satisfaction of Mitchell's words--the way they map a woman's reality--seems to diminish as her autonomy increases. The reflections of a rich, faithless, compulsively mobile, and compulsively romantic female are only marginally more valuable than those of her marginally more privileged male counterparts, especially the third or fourth time around. It ain't her, bub, it ain't her you're lookin' for.

When you peruse the lyrics, which are of course provided, the rage she directs at evangelists, racketeers, financiers, and so forth seems like the usual none-too-deep left-liberal modernism--a ""culture in decline"" enthralled by hedonism and rapacity and the image, tsk-tsk. But by taking her mind off her ever-loving self she's broken a long drought. There's no what-shall-I-do ennui in her singing; she isn't musing, she's telling us something, and her interest in these well-expressed middlebrow clich������������������s comes through.

At first I thought this reunion album lacked magic, but these guys sound remarkably whole for a band that failed to take over the world in 1967. You can hear the country undertone now, but you can also hear why you missed it--at their most lyrical these guys never lay back, and lyricism is something they're usually rocking too hard to bother with, though their compact forms guarantee poetic justice. Full of hope as they foresee their doom, stoned and drunk and on the move and yet always together, and above all intense, they should have at least taken over the country. All they really lacked was a boss, and what could be more American than that?

They were quintessentially inauthentic--three bar-band honchos, a showbiz kid, a hippie head case, and a svengali with a specialty in indentured servitude. Their accomplishment was nothing less and nothing more than the invention of El Lay country-rock--in San Francisco, where they were dismissed as phonies and interlopers. The Eagles would have happened without them, Poco too, but these guys got to the hyper harmonies and amped-up licks before they constituted any kind of copout. They also played the blues, jammed supernaturally hard, and put 14 loopy, optimistic songs that saw beyond the provincial counterculture of the Haight on a debut album ineptly overhyped by a label that still doesn't know what to do with it. The canard that they never cut another decent track is no more absurd than said label's assurances that they have two-and-a-half hours of memorable music in them. Yet only on this two-CD set can you purchase Moby Grape. Conveniently, it comprises the first 14 cuts. And typically, the sublime ""Fall on You"" is wrecked by a minute of producer gab even more justly unreleased than the rest of the crap that fills out the package.

Dolly hopes he'd love her even if she wore different-colored shoes; Leonard hopes she never sees him in his old earmuffs.

These aging no-wave stalwarts have outgrown the blinding-headache approach without giving up their stubbornly untrendy belief that you play music for love, with some well-aimed hate thrown in. ""End of the World"" could pass for early Television, and ""El Salvador""--the title is half of the lyric--is the political song of the year (and available even more clear and tortured as a Rough Trade single). Perhaps because the final ten tracks weren't mixed by Chris Stamey, this fourteen-song, thirty-minute tape does cry out for aspirin as it proceeds. But I play it for love.

Lifting everything worth lifting off their 1977 double-best-of and adding four recent hits, this is Subsequently Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown's legacy despite the French ""Look at Me I'm in Love"" and a shrill pressing that narrows their falsettos. Among the additions is ""I Could Have Loved You,"" a second chance at a one-night stand worthy of Smokey Robinson (with a writing credit for Bette Midler). Among the keepers is ""Love on a Two Way Street."" Remember that one? You will.

FALSE,B+,Feelin' It Together,James Moody,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11688,"
On Parker-Gillespie's ""Anthropology"" (astonishing) and ""Kriss Kross,"" the anguish and wit of Moody's second-generation bop reed playing sounds as fresh as if black humor hadn't come to mean something quite different, and when he chooses to divert or soothe he is often intelligent and sensuous. But sometimes (acceding, I suspect, to the more trivial imagination of pianist Kenny Barron) his lyricism becomes so lightweight that its intricate sophistication serves only to disguise its lack of substance. Or maybe I mean that the man should give up the flute.

FALSE,B+,Sweet Charlie Babe,Jackie Moore,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7460,"
Figures that this should fall somewhere between state-of-the-art and great-mean soul: the five hits go back to ""Precious, Precious"" in the winter of '71, with the two latest cut at a funkier-than-usual Sigma in Philadelphia and the others by a simpler-than-usual Crawford-Shapiro team at Criteria in Miami. Moore's voice is simultaneously sweet and rough, an unusual combination in a woman, and the songs are pretty consistent. But she lacks not only persona but personality, so that what in technical terms is pretty impressive stuff never goes over the top.

FALSE,B+,Shake and Push,The Morells,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11416,"
These four permanent residents of Springfield, Missouri, and environs unearth minor classics Dave Edmunds would give his doctorate for. New rockabilly doesn't come any more authentic or less purist than ""Eager Boy"" (he wants to be a senator) or ""Ugly and Slouchy"" (she won't cheat) or their own ""Red's"" (eats). But Rockpile, the Blasters, even the Stray Cats fire their roots into the future with an edgy intensity that's missing from the performances and recording here, which makes the difference on a record that might have been a minor classic itself.

FALSE,B+,The Best Bar Band Ever! 'Live' in '84,The Morells,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14663,"
This Missouri quintet never much rocked the house, playing their ""Rockabilly/Beach Music/Psychedelic Bubblegum"" for fun rather than intensity--a looser kind of release that helps flat patches pass before you know it. And did they have a nose for a certain kind of unprepossessing good song. The Strangeloves' ""Cara-Lin"" and their own ""Growin' a Beard,"" two of the six selections they hauled out for both of the shows these matched 79-minute discs document, each rely on a repetitive chorus of no great import that any sentient human will memorize involuntarily within two minutes. That leaves 37 songs played once, mostly covers you've never heard in your life--a life that will be just slightly happier after you get to know them.

FALSE,B+,Jagged Little Pill,Alanis Morissette,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=40,"
I was down with the Riot Grrrl Appreciation Society on this reluctant refugee from Canadian children's television, who some say was invented by Madonna herself so she could distract the publicity machine while raising her own biological girl. That is, I approved when she played the pissed-off spikehead and recoiled from such candid self-dramatizations as ""Perfect"" and ""Mary Jane."" But with help from six or seven arrantly effective songs, she's happy to help 15 million girls of many ages stick a basic feminist truth in our faces: privileged phonies have identity problems too. Not to mention man problems.

FALSE,B+,Travistan,Travis Morrison,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12567,"
Predictably, Morrison's predictably intelligent solo debut puts personality where the Dismemberment Plan's synergy used to be. If the old ploy almost works, that's because he gets synergy out of sidemen and because the album's better half focuses on his circumstances rather than his feelings, which bog the songs down toward the end. Try ""Born in '72,"" a detailed account of privilege's lineaments and limitations, and don't think you're too well-informed for the edutaining ditties about the penny, the nickel, the dime, and the quarter.

FALSE,B+,Veedon Fleece,Van Morrison,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4096,"
I count it as progress that his muse is feeding him baseball metaphors, but Morrison hasn't vented his Gaelic soul so unabashedly since Astral Weeks. He'd get away with it if there were more than one decent song on side two. Soothing, evocative late-night music that indulges his discursive side. Favorite title: ""You Don't Pull No Punches but You Don't Push the River.""
"
FALSE,B+,Wavelength,Van Morrison,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4098,"
Unlike A Period of Transition, this is a good Van Morrison record, as up as any he's ever made, but it's certainly not a great one. You might pay attention to side two, an evocative reinterpretation of Van's America fixation, but side one is nothing more (and nothing less) than class programming.
"
FALSE,B+,Poetic Champions Compose,Van Morrison,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4103,"
His first interesting album in five years sounds best as a CD for the same reason it isn't all that interesting--in his current spiritual state, which could last until he rages against the dying of the light, he doesn't much care about interesting. He just wants to roll on, undulating from rhythmic hill to melodic dale. If only he'd resequenced the third-stream instrumental ""Celtic Excavation"" so that it closed the full-length digital work instead of opening its nonexistent second side, he'd have framed his dinner music perfectly. Yeah, dinner music--I figure if it doesn't make me want to vomit, it must have something going for it.

FALSE,B+,Enlightenment,Van Morrison,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4105,"
Only a perverse motherfucker would choose such a title for an album whose title refrain goes ""Don't know what it is."" What's he trying to do, fake out the satori market? Also: orchestras, the names of r&amp;b singers, a weird recitative about the radio, and other tried-and-trues, all executed with faith, hope, and charity. Inspirational Verse: ""In my soul, in my soul, in my soul.""

FALSE,B+,Hymns to the Silence,Van Morrison,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4107,"
The usual wealth of fertilizer spread over two shortish CDs, long on love songs and the aforementioned hymns--wish the rejected title Ordinary Life was more accurate. Maybe they renamed the thing so churls like me wouldn't ask why nobody 86'd a few hymns. Like all of his recent and no doubt future work, it's slower than necessary, even in an artist of Van's advanced years. And like so much of his recent and I expect future work, it's more affecting than you'd figure. True love, eh? The simple life, huh? The days before rock and roll, did you say? Sounds kind of good.

FALSE,B+,Bona Drag,Morrissey,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2453,"
To Anglophiles, Anglos, and young alternative rockers who've never known another world, Morrissey's solo singles are fraught with paradigm, but to the rest of us they're a chapter in the life of a great twit. Less secure in his delusions of grandeur and worthlessness than when he was top of the pops, he hides behind the bitchy jokes his followers consider beneath him. At least half of these fizzle-prone chart charges will amuse and excite the curiosity-seeker. That any of them could be conceived as pop hits is why there are still Anglophiles. Inspirational Verse: ""This is the last song I will ever sing (yay!)/No I've changed my mind again (boo!).""
"
FALSE,B+,Kill Uncle,Morrissey,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2454,"
What kills the faithful is the anonymously supportive production, never distinctive enough to threaten (or challenge) a fading superstar in the throes of permanent identity crisis. But though they do meander into the insufferably ruminative self-pity that never used to bother Smiths fans, the songs start out plenty striking, guitar signature or no guitar signature. Tart as a grand aunt, louder on the gay subtext now that he's no longer an antipinup, Morrissey isn't just another English eccentric. He exemplifies what's made eccentricity a staple export of that once-proud nation for generations. Good show.
"
FALSE,B+,Bill Morrissey,Bill Morrissey,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5501,"
There's ten years of rough jobs and bumming around in these trenchant, unassuming songs, with no aura of folkie slumming to stink things up. Morrissey took those jobs to make money, not to gather material, and he went on the road to get away from home. Of course, industrial New England leaves its stamp on everything he writes anyway--his lyrics are so local, so devoid of pop universals, that even if he wanted more than finger-picking on his LP I doubt anyone would give him the budget for it. Which sad to say leaves only a stylized is-that-John-Prine? drawl to carry his familiar little tunes.
"
FALSE,B+,North,Bill Morrissey,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=311,"
His deep voice sheds affectation as his music approaches the delicacy of pure folkie accompaniment, all the better to show off what he's here for: ""idiot verse."" Which is laconic, not idiotic, and damn near definitive on his great theme--how much men need to work and how much they'd rather be doing something else. Never before have so many protagonists been snowbound and liked it.
"
FALSE,B+,Reggae Greats,Pablo Moses,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5504,"
The first three cuts of this ""compilation"" are the first three cuts of A Song, which everyone knows is the better of the two albums he cut for Island. The fourth appears later, as does one from side two. ""Each Is a Servant,"" A Song's purest song, does not. The fine-as-can-be Pave the Way selections represent an aural break just like always. Sure, buy the sampler if you can get it cheap. And if A Song gets sent to the bins to make room, steal 'em both.
"
FALSE,B+,Bring Me Home,Mother Earth,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7464,"
On the face of it this is a slight improvement, introducing three major songs--the Eric Kaz side-openers and Steve Young's ""Seven Bridges Road."" And if the powerful, arresting arrangement of Kaz's ""Temptation Took Control of Me and I Fell"" isn't as far out as what the original band used to try in San Francisco, it's certainly played with more assurance. Still, when you've boiled it down to backing up a singer and the songs, both had better be special all the time. And they ain't.
"
FALSE,B+,Weasels Ripped My Flesh,The Mothers of Invention,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8190,"
Talk about ""montage""--the construction here is all juxtaposition, the composition all interruption. Together with some relatively straightforward instrumentals and ""My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama,"" the album's two finest strokes--a metal remake of Little Richard's ""Directly From My Heart to You"" and ""Oh No"" a devastating reply to ""All You Need Is Love""--would make for a highly enjoyable album. But if Brecht considered pure enjoyment counterrevolutionary, Zappa considers it dumb--that's why he breaks in constantly with dialogue and vocal or electronic sounds whose musical interest/value is essentially theoretical. I find most of these engaging enough to think I might want to listen again some day. But all that means is that I enjoy it, quite moderately, in spite of itself.
"
FALSE,B+,No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith,Motorhead,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5508,"
Vic Maile's power-packed definition obliterates my bias against live recording. Remakes of white lies like ""No Class"" and ""Stay Clean"" and calling cards like ""Bomber"" and ""Motorhead"" save valuable shelf space. So what if it gives me a headache? Sometimes a headache comes as a relief.

FALSE,B+,Approved by the Motors,The Motors,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3730,"
Last time, they essayed a commercial takeoff on punk, which they traced back to Grand Funk Railroad rather than the Stooges; this time (punk having been declared economically unsound by English bizzers), they have a go at power pop and come out sounding like the Foundations rather than the Small Faces. Since reformed pub rockers are more comfortable with cuteness than with power, this is an enormous improvement--""Airport"" is as funny as any Nick Lowe genre piece and catchy enough to do jingle duty at Gatwick. Unfortunately, just to keep up their pseudo-punk credibility, they also include a equivocal celebration of sadism. I mean, fun is fun.
"
FALSE,B+,Rock and Roll Queen,Mott the Hoople,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2469,"
Mick Ralphs's title tune--which is to ""Starfucker"" as Bad Company is the Rolling Stones--defines the virtues and limitations of this raucous compilation. Rescuing serviceable rockers from all of their Atlantic albums and utilizing only the most simple-minded covers (""You Really Got Me"" and ""Keep a Knockin'""), it presents pre-Bowie Mott as an endearingly crude touring band, with enough hooks to keep things going. And it draws on only five minutes of Brain Capers.
"
FALSE,B+,Heretic Pride,The Mountain Goats,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13978,"
Maybe John Darnielle's intent singing isn't putting his lyrics across. If that hadn't long been a question, Darnielle wouldn't be one more alt hero--a former psychiatric nurse who's always writing and spends his life greeting his far-flung cult on the road. He'd be some kind of new Dylan--he's that prolific and that imaginative. Still, one wonders whether 4AD has thrown his critical followers off with its line about how this one abandons autobiography for ""mythical creatures"" etc. Once I'd read along online, looked up ""autoclave"" in the dictionary, and figured out that ""Sept 15, 1983"" was the day Prince Far I was murdered, I agreed that not every song could possibly be autobiographical--not the one about Mike Myers's makeup, for instance. But even the title track could be read as a metaphor about stubbornly nonconformist alt heroes, and half a dozen of these entries are the desperate-to-doomed love songs he's made a specialty. An autoclave is a device that sterilizes with pressurized steam. When the narrator says, ""My heart is an autoclave,"" I suspect he's Darnielle.
"
FALSE,B+,Goths,The Mountain Goats,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17098,"
Propelled though they are by rock-sturdy Jon Wurster, the arrangements evoke a keyboard-based, explicitly guitarless cocktail jazz of modest drive and less bite. John Darnielle sings with a dulcet lucidity that's almost angelic, the melodies chime in, and although I assume I'm missing some references, the lyrics do well enough by goth music and lifestyle from a ""We Do It Different on the West Coast"" perspective. Nonetheless, a lounge-style concept album about goth is not unlike a bro-country concept album about chamber music. That its two great songs--""Abandoned Flesh"" and ""Andrew Eldritch Is Back in Leeds,"" to be precise--reach out not to rudderless fans but aging musicians suggest that Darnielle is ready to move on to the next obsession.

Decent rapper turns bling bling into ching ching until it stops making a noise, then gets sisterly on your ass, which is an improvement. Street, gangsta, 2-1-5, blah blah blah, she claims ""Different,"" but the differentest thing about her is she's Timbaland's front of the year. With Missy, commercial priorities aren't all Timbo keeps straight. Here he twists and sprawls, coaxing wisdom from Nelly Furtado and Nate Dogg, rapping death metal, layering like Tunisian pastry, and extracting a beat from a Charli Baltimore boy toy. Hey you, blow your whistle. See, doesn't work when I do it.

FALSE,B+,Sweet Potatoes,Geoff & Maria Muldaur,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7474,"
I really like this album, especially when Geoff gets nasty on ""I'm Rich"" and the sophomoric cheap shot ""Kneein' Me,"" both of which he wrote. But Chuck Berry's ""Havana Moon"" gives away his limitations. ""Havana Moon"" simply isn't a very good song--it's only ""interesting,"" as a pop aberration that has nothing to do with the thrust of Berry's music. Muldaur's version works quite well only because it singles out how ""interesting"" (and obscure) the song is. And too often ""interesting"" is all he wants to be.
"
FALSE,B+,Maria Muldaur,Maria Muldaur,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2245,"
Cut by cut, this bid to contemporize Maria's nouveau-jug music (two songs each from Wendy Waldman and David Nichtern, one each from Dr. John and Kate McGarrigle) is intelligent and attractive. But the overall effect is just slightly aimless and sterile. Maybe it's Muldaur's quavery voice, which only rarely has driven me to attention, or the low-risk flawlessness of the Lenny Waronker/Joe Boyd production. Or maybe it's just the curse of the jugheads--not knowing how to make good on your flirtations with nostalgia.

Mundell was all of sixteen when he cut this record in 1976; in 1983 he was shot to death. He brings to the naivete that can be so annoying in Rasta homilies a sweet, clear, militant innocence rendered even more delicate by Augustus Pablo's piano-tinged production. He believes in life everlasting, and he probably deserved it.

FALSE,B+,So Happy,Eddie Murphy,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5517,"
The failure of this wicked Prince rip to scale the charts reminds us once again how difficult it is for defiant outsiders to fracture pop stereotypes. Murphy will never be El DeBarge, but he's perfect for cartoon funk, and over the years his wheedling croon has gotten serious. Maybe the problem is that his sexual urges still don't emanate from very deep inside. Often, in fact, they're inspired by his bathroom reading--he's big on locations, spends an entire song convincing her to do it in a chair. Inspirational Dialogue: She: ""Are you close?"" He: ""If I get any closer I be behind you.""

This is a hair and a half form capturing her amused, husky sweetness and square-jawed sex appeal, and I'll settle. Ballads, message songs, and medium-tempo heart-tuggers have all been slightly upgraded, and the reggaefied Bobby Darin and her latest Beatles cover rock as good as Ronstadt.

Following ""Snowbird"" with ""Danny's Song"" with ""A Love Song"" with ""You Won't See Me,"" the first side is all any curiosity-seeker need own or even know of the singing gym teacher from Nova Scotia. Only a boho bigot could deny these middle-American apotheoses; they bridge cultures as resolutely as C.P. Snow. They also show off Brian Ahern's Nashville country-rock, with Jim Ed Norman's side-closing ""You Needed Me"" improved by the association. Second side's all Norman, and though most of it is equally tuneful and confident, it's complacent calculation is why we need boho bigotry. All told, as neat a demonstration of aesthetic principle as Metal Machine Music.
"
FALSE,B+,Golden Hour,Kacey Musgraves,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17441,"
Product of Nashville though it may be, this is a pop record straight up, marked throughout by song-doctoring overseers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk, who score cowrites on most tracks, play keyboards, drums, and such on every one, and go all but unnamed in its raft of raves. I mean ""pop"" as an observation, not a criticism. Tashian's modest piano parts complement Musgraves's delicate soprano and positive mood more subtly than any pedal steel could; the sound-setting ""Slow Burn,"" about taking all night, and the LSD-fueled ""Mother,"" about ""bursting with empathy"" as you miss her and miss her some more, are triumphs of the pop imagination by any measure. So in the rock era's biggest yet quietest year of the woman to date, this team has figured out how to make quiet sell. If its quiet never breaks on through to the other side, that's not only deliberate but one reason so many are raving and buying. But it's also why I'm not altogether sold myself.

FALSE,B+,No Wave,Music Revelation Ensemble,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5520,"
I know, Blood Ulmer and his boys probably spent more time plugging in their amps than knocking off the music. Too much of it is free-jazz fucking around, even less faithful to their nuclear fusion in its carelessness than the Rough Trade album in its care. Still, when David Murray starts to blow on the one they call ""Baby Talk,"" and not even over one of Jackson-Ali's funkier beats, it's fun, and a revelation. Buy the official version first. But up this one a notch for erring in the right wrong direction.

FALSE,B+,Check It!,Mutabaruka,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2483,"
Is it okay to be impressed by this reggae poet's decidedly unmystical humanist Rastafarianism and still wish his presentation had more of that old-time religion? Though he camouflages his intellectual distance better than Linton Kwesi Johnson, his compassion is less self-effacing, and his dub modernism plays a little too loose with the riddims to suit me. But he has plenty to teach anyone who values reggae strictly for its straightforward charm.

I wouldn't give back rock and roll if it were mine to relinquish and Africa's to claim. But for all his ital hit-and-miss, I hope this Afrocentrist is taken seriously--especially when it comes to such crucial matters as God in the sky (""a universal lie"") and when-is-a-revolution-not-a revolution? (when it's a revolt). Let it also be noted that he breaks into Afrobeat and pop-funk and chamber-synth more meaningfully than universalists do.

Child of a Zulu father, a Xhosa mother, and the Soweto uprising, he lives on the run, reciting his poetry unannounced and unaccompanied at weddings, funerals, union meetings: an authentic art hero, and as committed a revolutionary as ever cut an album. Which doesn't mean he can be comprehended out of context. So what's amazing about his first stab at music isn't the incompleteness of the translation, but the power. Before he utters a word there's some halting guitar that could make you weep, and despite the disorderly percussion favored by Black Consciousness bands he powers a South African dub poetry--with intimations of an apocalypse that's lived every day and agape so hard-earned only a Boersymp would doubt it.

Remember that posthumous outtakes CD Bad Boy attributed to Biggie? No? Good then--it was foul, not just ill shit but stupid ill shit. These finalized versions of tracks fans have long bootlegged is the opposite. Where the ex-dealer thought it wise to conceal his brutishness, the fake thug thought it wise to conceal his sensitivity. Surrounding outtakes that were just outtakes is back-in-the-day recommended to Tim and Missy (even has some pronunciation in it) and four autobiographical pieces. The two about his parents are juicier than the mother love gushing from God's Son. The Afrocentric pep song is so much deeper than the mawkish, misinformed new ""I Can"" that you believe he might yet get politics. And ""Drunk by Myself"" describes his alcoholism. Pass what Courvoisier?

Sax man Nathanson is the second-best composer and best improviser (though not player) in the Lounge Lizards, trombonist Fowlkes his fellow traveler. Here they indulge their fondness for jazz of the real variety without sacrificing their sense of humor or taste in packaging.

Anything but a sucker for texts from the Old Testament, Jesus, Shiva, and Kahlil Gibran, I kept wondering who the bass player was. As I should have known and kind of guessed, it was the text-borrower in question. So never mind about Leviticus--this is the humanistic groove never quite made flesh by the jazz-tinged ambient foreground of Sade, Anita Baker, and D'Angelo.

In which a strong-voiced, historically-minded, salsa-loving Senegalese guitarist and painter records a suitably impressive elder's debut at 74, with his steadfast gravity the linchpin and the band the reason non-Wolof speakers will listen. With Xalam, OK Jazz, and Africando recruits on board, it's basically an Orchestra Baobab one-off with the focus on saxophonist Thierno Koyat? rather than crazier saxophonist Issa Cissoko and the Xalam and OK Jazz guys pitching in where Togo-based Barthelemy Attisso normally moves heaven and earth. The hypnotic clave of ""Bouki Ndiour"" and the warm lyricism of ""Arawane Ndiaye"" might heighten your expectations unduly. But hell--take a chance.

Cut in Paris in 1984 and now wisely remixed, this isn't as epochal as N'Dour thought it was when he wrote the title tune to his displaced Afro-Gallic brothers and sisters.

Produced by Peter Gabriel henchman George Acogny, this is no more a rhythm album than whatever Gabriel opus you care to recall. It's just a very good Peter Gabriel record. Gabriel's m.o. is to pump up rock and ""third-world"" sonorities with grandiose settings and structures, then put them across with a big beat; N'Dour's arrangements are less forced, his beats indigenous enough, and his lyrics better. Sure there are old saws (""Truth will always win against deceit,"" ""You should help those with less than you""), and ""Macoy,"" a  compassionate vignette of lost virginity concealed, is overwhelmed by its portentous synth-wash-and-percussion accompaniment. But when N'Dour, who's put down as a ""ladies"" singer by some Senegalese (men, presumably), advises his four-year-old daughter to follow her ""destiny,"" or collaborates with Gabriel on a feminist anthem you can believe in, I think his quest for fame could be as humanitarian as corporate one-worlders claim. And when he's inspired to write a song about a slavery museum in Africa, the NASA museum in Washington, and his favorite, ""the museum town of Old Tucson,"" his ambition--to grasp the past, change the future, and master the very media to which he's been subject by accident of national origin for most of his young life--suddenly seems heroic.

The arranged rock song may be slipping beyond the reach of white men. In a context defined by Paul Simon and Robbie Robertson, even a talent like Freedy Johnston risks sounding smug by association, while many women--Sin������������������ad O'Connor, Bonnie Raitt, Rosanne Cash, Laurie Anderson--escape the taint. So does Living Colour. And so does N'Dour, whose mbalax commitments mitigate any conceptual link to studio-rock. On 14 songs that once would have required double vinyl, he strikes an African tone far from pop's confessionals and attempted empathy. Directing matter-of-fact moral warnings at the powerful and the disenfranchised like the griot he might have been, he's confident of his social function as he tours the world. And for all that the set-piece stiffness seems as outmoded in America as it must seem modern in Senegal. Since N'Dour usually sings in Wolof, the lyric sheet is a necessity"

Although I doubt a physical would add much context, this download-only album proves that the Dakar tycoon and sometime pol still knows music is his bedrock--without conveying anything specific outsiders can make out, true, but when the music is N'Dour's, that's usually enough. Six new songs, eight tracks, kicked off by the atypical ululations that announce the atypically relaxed title opener and highlighted by three versions of the apparently Senegal-centric ""Mbegu����"" unimpeded by the superfluous guitar intro of the live one, as well as two very similar mixes featuring kora master Toumani Diabate. For Wolof speakers, this album may function as a major statement. For me the major statement is that this great musician and fairly great man is unlikely to go away soon.

Like so many performance artists of the computerized tape recorder, they would have been called comedians or just wise guys in prepostmodern times, so it's nice that they know something about both music and yucks. Rather than elucidating the title theme, I'll name favorite bits: real estate ad atop handgun ad, J5 cartoon, four-year-old singing ""Over the Rainbow,"" lecture on the Autonomous Commie Republic, orgasm on the Playboy Channel. And mention that I listen with interest/pleasure to every one.

FALSE,B+,Country Grammar,Nelly,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2542,"
Cornell Haynes's St. Louis singsong rolls over an easy mix of N.O. Bounce, Cleveland thug harmony, and L.A. tweedle-twaddle. He remains faithful to Cedric the Entertainer's congenial cellphone-jester intro as he works through some mild dope-slangin' and bitch-mackin' consumer fetishism, and despite all the expensive cars I hope he paid cash for, the jolly diffidence of his heavily accented local color makes his hedonism seem more benign and accessible than the N.O. if not ATLien variety. There's bite to the mild moralism he works through, too, especially the St. Lunatics' detailed report on cannabis addiction. ""Blow 30 mill like I'm Hammer,"" he boasts early on, and he's such a nice guy you hope it is 30 mill--and wish with all your heart he wasn't certain to blow whatever it turns out to be instead.

FALSE,B+,Yesterday's Wine,Willie Nelson,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7501,"
The great Nashville songsmith has never bowled anyone over with his singing, and here he finds the concept to match. Since ""perfect man"" has already been and gone, he announces at the outset, ""the voice of imperfect man must now be made manifest, and I have been chosen as the most likely candidate."" Most of these songs--though not the two best, ""Yesterday's Wine"" and ""Me and Paul""--are on religious themes, and on more than one he seems to be playing the part of God's messenger, which tends to limit their general relevance. But if that's how he got to ""These Are Difficult Times,"" maybe it was worth it. Anyway, sometimes his nonsinging bowls me over.
"
FALSE,B+,Shotgun Willie,Willie Nelson,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4169,"
This attempt to turn Nelson into a star runs into trouble when it induces him to outshout Memphis horns or Western swing, and his unaccompanied-acoustic version of ""A Song for You"" takes some getting used to. After a while, though, you notice that you're noticing every song. And then you realize that the two you notice most--the slyly vengeful ""Sad Songs and Waltzes"" and the cuckold's tragedy ""She's Not for You""--are also the two oldest. A star, eh?
"
FALSE,B+,To Lefty from Willie,Willie Nelson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4172,"
Although Nelson earned his legend as a songwriter, he's turning into a singer now that profit-taking time has come--does broaden one. The amazing thing is that he gets away with it. On this heartfelt if opportune farewell to Lefty Frizzell, his cracks and creaks and precisely conversational timing hold their own against the more conventionally exquisite singing of Merle Haggard or Frizzell himself. Of course, the material doesn't hurt.
"
FALSE,B+,Somewhere Over the Rainbow,Willie Nelson,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4178,"
Nelson's best since Stardust isn't quite the rehash it seems to be. The often uptempo music is suffused with Western swing, the standards not all that standard. Which would be great if only Nelson's ecumenicism didn't run in the direction of ""My Mother's Eyes,"" the aforementioned ""Over the Rainbow,"" and a jazzed-up ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.""
"
FALSE,B+,Willie Nelson's Greatest Hits (and Some That Will Be),Willie Nelson,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4177,"
Nelson's strength is hitting a song on the button while glancing off in the other direction, and a compilation is no way to highlight it--the necessarily haphazard structure makes him seem not so much casual as indolent. He needs a little album structure--standards, collaboration, half-assed narrative--to tone things up. Song for song, relaxing; on the whole, mushy.
"
FALSE,B+,American Classic,Willie Nelson,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14664,"
Not Stardust--because nothing is, because standards albums pack no conceptual kick anymore, and because producer Booker T. Jones was venturing into the unknown where producer Tommy LiPuma is just doing his cocktail-jazz tap dance. Still, the consistency of approach and material accentuates Nelson's barely perceptible evolution into not just an uncannily canny singer, not just a subtly swinging singer, but one of the greatest singers alive. He's talky, but he's always had heaps of high end and loads of low, and he's expended his resources so nonchalantly that at 76 he has more voice left than many with twice his natural endowment. He takes songs easy without throwing them away, and these were written to hold up their end of that bargain.

FALSE,B+,Heroes,Willie Nelson,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15845,"
How much you value this entry in the 79-year-old's unchartable catalogue--over and above ""Roll Me Up,"" in which Jamey Johnson, Kris Kristofferson, and none other than Snoop Dogg top off the title with the genius punch line ""and smoke me when I die""--depends on what you make of Willie's 23-year-old son Lukas, who sings on nine of the tracks and wrote three of them. I think one of his originals is aces, one self-sustaining, and one--which naturally goes on for six minutes--the worst thing on the record. But once I learned to distinguish him from the half-century older Billie Joe Shaver, who undercuts the solemn title track with his patented off-the-cuff aplomb, I decided that Lukas's stoned-hillbilly affect was just what his dad needed to distinguish this particular assortment of what-thes, why-hasn't-he-evers, and written-to-orders from rival entries in his unchartable catalogue.
"
FALSE,B+,San Antonio Rose,Willie Nelson & Ray Price,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4176,"
Nelson's groove has resembled a rut since he hit paydirt with Stardust, so give a cheer--maybe he's out of it. Country standards gone vaguely Western swing (in Nashville, without horns), this is nothing startling, but the false steps and lackadaisical jams of the live doubles and the Leon Russell job are gone. Price, who tends to posture in countrypolitan settings, thrives on the relaxed atmosphere. People who don't know the originals are going to fall in love.
"
FALSE,B+,Nervus Rex,Nervus Rex,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5533,"
Lauren Agnelli has gotten noticed ever since she was Trixie A. Balm, but Shaun Brighton is the secret: no matter how much you object to his fruity singing, don't miss his songs. Imagine the Left Banke with Mike Chapman, a sense of humor, and the wherewithal to hold up their own legend. Imagine ""Don't Look"" following up ""Walk Away Renee.""
"
FALSE,B+,Compilation,Michael Nesmith,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7508,"
Nesmith began his career on RCA as a crackpot inventor and ended as a bankrupt cottage industry. The title of his final RCA LP, And the Hits Just Keep On Coming, was more wishful than sarcastic, which is why he's seen to its reissue, as well as that of Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash, another pretty much standard country-song sampler. Seven of the twelve cuts on this compilation (another great title) come from those two albums. The side that concentrates on earlier stuff is an amazing contraption, one piece of zonked Nashville after another. The other side is a pretty much standard-plus display case. Among the missing: ""The Grand Ennui,"" ""Calico Girlfriend,"" ""Mama Nantucket,"" ""The Keys to the Car.""
"
FALSE,B+,Loose Salute,Mike Nesmith & the First National Band,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7505,"
In which Nesmith continues his transmutation into Gram Parsons for television fans, or the Jimmy Rodgers of Sunset Strip. I'm beginning to suspect that he takes his meandering thoughts and marble columns in the sky more seriously than they deserve. But his songwriting gifts are at a peak on this amalgam of gimmicks and mannerisms, long-vowel articles and near-yodels and electronic excursions and alien rhythms. At its best, sublime schlock; at its worst, downhome kitsch.
"
FALSE,B+,Orchid in the Storm,Aaron Neville,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11,"
In which Joel Dorn lets the eerie, quavering shimmer and imperturbable naturalness of Aaron's falsetto run, drift, float, or soar with six '50s covers. The singer avoids the overstated Russell Thompkins mode more wanly than necessary, but with teen dreams from Johnny Ace and the Penguins turned into the essence of timeless romance, the sublimely silly ""Ten Commandments of Love"" sounds like dictation from Mount Sinai.
"
FALSE,B+,Fiyo on the Bayou,The Neville Brothers,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2546,"
Unlike their Jack Nitzsche-produced flop, this one sounds like gumbo--the spirit is willing and the flesh can't resist. Unfortunately, the tunes are so surefire that I long ago memorized the way other Nworlins stalwarts (and Jimmy Cliff) do 'em--in a word, better. An enjoyable way for neophytes to get into the most universal rock and roll style--and a lazy way for oldtimers to convince themselves that the world isn't changing.
"
FALSE,B+,Uptown,The Neville Brothers,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2549,"
Contrary to rumor, the drums are almost all live, but they so rarely venture an offbeat that it's a solecism to call the result commercial funk. It's not crossover because the Nevilles have no black/""urban"" base to cross over from, and no one's claiming it's New Orleans. Nope--between adult themes, solidly insinuating tunes, uncommonly grizzled vocals, and faint indigenous lilt, what we have here is a pretty damn good CHR album. Too bad ""Whatever It Takes"" and ""Midnight Key"" will never prove the durability of their old-love-rekindled and night-lust-unloosed in the crucible of high rotation; too bad ""Shak-a-Na-Na""'s second-linish Brit imagism and ""Old Habits Die Hard""'s Tops-Tempts-Tavares homage aren't gimmicky enough to push some gatekeeper's everything-old-is-new button. Because this risks the unknown just the way the crass dance-fad novelty ""Mardi Gras Mambo"" did in 1954. There's aesthetic tension in its craft and blind ambition, and reason to think it'll sound quirkier and realer than Fiyo on the Bayou another 23 years down the line.

FALSE,B+,New Edition,New Edition,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5536,"
Though a confusion of production teams--five in all, none associated with the ousted Arthur Baker except by ripoff (from Freez's ""I.O.U.,"" very clever)--gives these kids' major-label hit a misbegotten look, in the end the album achieves the winning commercial variety Baker didn't get out of them. But I admit it--for me the biggest winner is ""My Secret,"" which does sound an awful lot like the Jackson 5.
"
FALSE,B+,A-Z,Colin Newman,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5539,"
Projected and rejected as the fourth Wire album, it would have been the right step backwards--regressive only if you consider noise uncouth. Producer Mike Thorne's keyboards are indeed all over the place, but rather than laying down the trancy gloss of 154, they do what they can do to rub a body the wrong way, just like Newman's guitar. Leading me to suspect that the absent Graham Lewis is Wire's new-waving fifth columnist. Of course, Lewis also probably contributes the catchy stuff--where on Pink Flag you remember every allusively desperate little song, here you recognize the oblique, abrasive gestalt. And remember ""B,"" which has no lyrics at all, every time its rousing climax comes around.
"
FALSE,B+,Little Criminals,Randy Newman,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2878,"
Always the master craftsman, Newman doesn't waste a second here, doesn't permit an inept lyrical insight or musical fillip. But over the past three years he doesn't seem to have written one song that ranks with his best. Among all these explorations of America's dirty white underbelly, only the out-and-out jokes--the gross intolerance of ""Short People"" and the Eagles music on ""Rider in the Rain""--distinguish themselves. Very disappointing.
"
FALSE,B+,Born Again,Randy Newman,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2879,"
This has more content and feeling than Little Criminals. But as with Little Criminals its highlight is a (great) joke--""The Story of a Rock and Roll Band,"" which ought to be called ""E.L.O."" and isn't, for the same reason supergroupie radio programmers have shied away from it. Hence, the content comprises ever more intricate convolutions of bad taste; rather than making you think about homophobes and heavy-metal toughs and me-decade assholes the way he once made you think about rednecks and slave traders and high school belles, he makes you think about how he feels about them. Which just isn't as interesting.
"
FALSE,B+,Land of Dreams,Randy Newman,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2881,"
He who lives by the putdown shall die by the putdown, so Newman's first nonsoundtrack album in almost six years is unlikely to increase his renown or his financial holdings. And indeed, it's half mishmash, replete with compulsive irony, rap parody, and spare, hooked love songs that are equally unbelievable happy or sad. But there's a new pitch of displacement to the pseudo-autobiographical triptych at the outset, and a new pitch of bitterness to the scabrous putdowns that highlight the close. The airplay hit ""It's Money That Matters"" and the ""We Are the World"" answer song ""I Want You To Hurt Like I Do"" are the attention-getters. The cruelly laid-back supply-side boogie-woogie ""Roll With the Punches"" and the symphonically overstated going-to-school reminiscence ""Four Eyes"" are the strokes. Inspirational Verse: ""Here's your little brown shoes, can you tie them yourself?""

FALSE,B+,Fine Old Tom,Tom Newman,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7513,"
Tom seems to have recorded this far across the sea in 1975, but more than that even my Anglophile sources can't tell me. Analogies: Dave Edmunds (studiomania and general non-esoteric musical orientation, although Newman isn't interested in overpowering anyone), Ray Davies (vaguely but persistently, for both eccentricity and vocal approach), Eno (more precisely, not only for eccentricity and vocal approach but also for style of smarts, although Newman isn't so blatantly avant-garde). Pretty catchy.
"
FALSE,B+,Thunder and Consolation,New Model Army,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5542,"
The alienation most bands traffic in is a byproduct of moderate privilege--with sustenance a given, they rant or joke or whine or bellow about meaning. This band sings for the true losers. Given their subject/audience, it's no wonder they've been known to make Britcrits fret about fascism--crippled and scattered by Thatcherism, deprived of the belonging the family isn't good for anymore, these ordinary ungifted people could turn into fascism's foot soldiers. Of course, give up on them and that's what you leave them. Identify, empathize, observe, remember, and they've got that much margin.
"
FALSE,B+,1981-1982,New Order,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5543,"
Bargain hunters shouldn't pass up this chance to own ""Temptation"" plus-four for close to the price of the twelve-inch. But I don't call the twelve-inch ""Temptation""/""Hurt"" for the same reason I can't remember which of the four is which after playing them all fifteen times. ""Temptation"" is where Manchester's finest stop hearing ghosts and stake their claim to a danceable pop of unprecedented grimness and power. If it isn't the definition of romantic obsession, it's even richer than I think it is. But it's also the first real song this sharp-cornered sound-and-groove band has ever come up with.
"
FALSE,B+,Movement,New Order,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2553,"
For months I've sworn to concentrate on the lyrics and be done with this goddamn record, but it ain't gonna happen. The singing isn't literally inaudible, but it is literally unprojected, much less noticeable than the surrounding drum, guitar, and synthesizer rhythms/effects. Very atmospheric--the spaceship as sepulcher, with a beat. And as long as I literally don't have to hear their doomy doggerel, not a bad way to go.
"
FALSE,B+,"Power, Corruption and Lies",New Order,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2554,"
The second or third Joy Division II album has occasioned disputation among the faithful. Some claim that it cynically recycles their riffs, while others think it raises that old new music to transcendent summits. Me, I find it relatively gentle and melodic in its ambient postindustrial polyrhythms, their nicest record ever. I also think it sounds pretty much like the others.
"
FALSE,B+,Low Life,New Order,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2555,"
Where once they determined to keep all affect out of their music, now they determine to put some in. Any dance-trance outfit that can lead off its Quincy Jones debut with an oblique ""Love Me Do"" quote has its heart (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) in the right place, so one doesn't want to quibble. But inserting affect isn't the same as actually feeling something, and it isn't the same as expressing (or even simulating) a feeling, either.
"
FALSE,B+,Technique,New Order,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2558,"
The catchy Anglodisco gloom fans have complained about ever since the band lightened up finally arrives, and it's a lot franker and happier (hence smarter) than Depeche Mode. But now that Bernard is a full-fledged human being, we find out he's a slightly boring human being. Is this why he was always in the dumps?
"
FALSE,B+,Electric Version,The New Pornographers,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11972,"
Earns its buzz. Tremendous craft, winning enthusiasm. You'll remember every song when it comes on--maybe even when it doesn't, hum hum. But if it has a point beyond whistling at the void, it declines to mention what that point might be. Also, I wish the sparingly deployed Neko Case would abandon her faux-country career. Carl Newman likes a lot of things about British pop that I don't, starting with vocal filters (his seems built-in) and that cute accent (signifying not class but artifice as a virtue). Is this what Zumpano sounds like? Who cares?
"
FALSE,B+,Challengers,The New Pornographers,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13728,"
Still a band that improves everyone in it, and more forthcoming this time, though they really ought to risk despoiling their precious graphics with lyrics. Carl Newman will always be too formal (do Canadians really say ""hangs in air,"" not ""hangs in the air""?), but when Neko Case steps up to take one of his difficult-love songs, feelings surface--and also the meanings Case's own albums archly avoid. Plus, who would have thought Destroyer Dan Bejar could write an open-skied Manhattan anthem that ventures into Queens? It's ""Myriad Harbour,"" the indie-rock ""New York, New York."" Mark Kozelek could cover it!

FALSE,B+,New Riders of the Purple Sage,New Riders of the Purple Sage,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7514,"
Many find the weakness of John ""Marmaduke"" Dawson's singing an a priori turnoff, but I'm perversely attached to it. This diminutive, definitely mild-mannered c&amp;w fantast betrays (I said betrays) none of the manipulative self-regard that marks the true wimp, and his voice suits the folkie-hippie casualness of the band's ""country""-""rock."" A feckless myth, to be sure--trucking women and heroic dopers, gentle aspiration and mysterious evil. But a charming and tuneful one.

FALSE,B+,Romantech,New York Gypsy All Stars,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16683,"
Released late 2011, this debut by a post-Balkan quintet built around Macedonian-born clarinet genius Ismael Lumanovski and knocked around by irrepressible Berklee-trained Turkish drummer Engin Kaan Gunaydin lags after a strong start and then races to the finish line for 25 minutes or so. Not that it's always speedy--""Outcry"" adds some gravity just when it's needed. But the closing ""EZ-Pass"" definitely makes a beeline for the no cash lane.

Ramboe used to be Nightmare Alley's rhythm guitarist, and since his Ratbags comprise bass and drums from his old band, I suggest he return to that position with expanded responsibilities. His postliterate wit (""When you got 'em by the balls you got their hearts and minds"") and referential rock and roll (""Give My Regards to Broadway""?) are cut from the same cloth, and maybe if he and Frank Ruscitti traded vocals, making this an album instead of a double EP, they'd achieve that mysterious simulation of musicality that induces radio's overseers to program wise guys. Then again, maybe they wouldn't--Ramboe is pretty tuneless, Ruscitti pretty tense.

For those benighted who still believe the original can't sing, here's a sweeter version, including appropriately lovely versions of two rare urban celebrations--""Vine Street"" (the one that led off Van Dyke Parks's Song Cycle) and ""Dayton, Ohio 1903."" Not so dynamic musically, though--just Nilsson singing, and Newman behind on piano.

Those who are taken with Nilsson the sweet, slightly kooky popmeister will approve of this reliable compilation--probably even dig Gordon Jenkins on ""As Time Goes By."" Those who are attracted to the popmeister by his apparent insanity will play it only in their most conservative moments.
"
FALSE,B+,Son of Schmilsson,Harry Nilsson,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7524,"
Nilsson functions on the edge of parody--his best stuff succeeds simultaneously as a kind of takeoff and as a genuinely moving example of the genre that has inspired him. Unfortunately, most of this album, which follows so close on the heels of his biggest commercial success that Nilsson (natch) makes a joke of it in the title, is too often merely funny or strange. This is wonderful as far as it goes. But those three or four songs that are much better than that suffer by association. Inspirational Verse: ""You're breakin'; my heart/You're tearin' it apart/So fuck you.""

Though it pulls up lame midway through side two and resorts to rape jokes that piss on the memory of Howlin' Wolf and for that matter Wolfman Jack, this album is as rude as it wants to be. Where competing raunch hands end at obscenity, Mojo starts there and moves on, saving his most raucous loathing for songs like ""I Hate Banks"" (and he don't mean Ernie or the Mississippi) and ""Ain't Got No Boss"" (""This is a personal phone call"").

Pop anarchobeatnikism has its political attractions--hard to argue when a college band calls for mall-burning even if the moment isn't historically propitious. But if Mojo thinks freedom's just another word for passing me on the shoulder in a traffic jam, let him try it--I'll veer right and proceed at exactly the same speed as our fellow citizen-sufferers, which I know from experience will make their day as much as it'll piss Mojo off. And if Mojo rams me in extended adolescent frustration, I'll sue his ass for the rights to ""Stuffin' Martha's Muffin."" Always did think those royalties should redound to National Rape Crisis Headquarters.

Art statements like ""Wash No Dishes No More"" and ""I Ain't Gonna Piss in No Jar"" can't be laughed off these days. ""Elvis Is Everywhere"" is for Phil Ochs in heaven, and by laying down cassette-and-CD-only tracks worth hearing they face up to their formal problem--making irresponsibility new. Not only would the agape-riven ""Don't Want No Foo-Foo Haircut on My Head"" and the primordial ""Story of One Chord"" fit quite audibly onto twelve inches of vinyl, they'd enlighten Mojo's collegiate followers. This cannot be said of the Americana-mongering ""We Gotta Have More Soul!"" and ""B.B.Q. U.S.A.,"" much less Skid's ""Lincoln Logs,"" in which the poor folkie misses his boyhood toys boo hoo.

FALSE,B+,Outburst,The Nomads,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3739,"
Why is this neogarage band better than all other neogarage bands? Admittedly, it could just be taste in covers--Alex Chilton and Sleepy John Estes as well as the Kinks and the eternal Standells. And it could be appetite for covers--eight all told leave room for only four overly generic originals. But it certainly helps that they're from Sweden--means their preference for American music is democratic rather than chauvinistic and adventurous rather than sentimental.

From ""Life's not a bitch, she's just sick of being personified"" to ""I attended candlelight vigils for Matthew Shepard/While you put out another fucking faggot record,"" Sage Francis seems sage enough, aesthetically and politically. But he's also the kind of hip-hopper who boasts, ""I go to Fugazi shows requesting Minor Threat songs""--an old school purist insofar as he's a hip-hopper at all, with woman problems for club cred. So a nice round of applause for Joe Beats, whose fresh new sounds and spare old beats make ""life of the search party,"" ""scent of death threats,"" and ""fairygodmotherfucker"" seem like wordplay rather than the one-upmanship that is Francis's reason for rapping.

Although I give them points for stick-to-it-iveness and good cheer, their records have always struck me as complacent because even the subtlest r&amp;b has a more pronounced backbeat. But on his second try, drummer Tom Ardolino makes a marginal but telling difference--the performance is urgent, intense, up, so that even given their adolescent romantic preoccupations (life on the road, it keeps you young) the songs take on a complex life worthy of their chord changes. And try Terry Adams's Jimi-meets-Thelonious clavinet on ""Talk to Me.""

I'm gratified that three out of four successive songs on side two--""Chores,"" ""This Old House,"" and ""Things We Like to Do""--mention problems of home maintenance, albeit invidiously (I put off the vacuuming myself).

Anybody with a taste for mbube's droll complexities, especially those who find Ladysmith too sweet (the pleasures some people deny themselves for tough-mindedness's sake), will get a kick out of this alternative.

Anybody who gets misty-eyed about the MC-5 owes it to himself (or herself, believe it or not) to ponder this Detroit boy's, well, let's call it his sexual rhetoric, which was virtually invented by the White Panthers. Maybe the when-in-doubt-whip-it-out of ""Stranglehold"" and ""Wang Dang Sweet Poontang"" and ""Free for All"" are only metaphors, but as metaphors, well, let's just say they suck. And having done so, let's add with only slightly guilty pleasure that his musclebound gooniness is a hoot. It's an evasion to pass him off as a harmless joke, but it's a distortion to pretend that he or anyone in his audience takes his bullshit more than half seriously. From flash guitar to locomotive beat to secret tunes, he's an unreconstructed '60s survivor--the hippie-biker as feral sex fiend, terror of countless timid ninnies and nice people. One way or another, well, let's just say I get off on everything here, with the slobbering ""Wango Tango"" a special favorite. Rock and roll!

FALSE,B+,Replicas,Gary Numan & Tubeway Army,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1343,"
Resistant as I am to the new strain of synthesizer punk now reaching us from England, I didn't connect to this for months--not until I listened to the singing. Numan's lyrics abound with aliens and policemen and pickups in what sounds at first like the worst sort of received decadence, but his monotone is too sweet and vulnerable for that impression to stick. To you it may be sordid sex and middlebrow sci-fi; to him it's romance and horror. The debut (Tubeway Army, Beggar's Banquet import) is faster, more pointed, and includes no instrumentals. This is catchier, more haunted, and includes two.

Four eight-minute dance tracks plunked down into a standard African (also disco) album format, this features the almost feminine tenor of the leader of Zaire's Orchestre les Kamal������������������, but it's made by the guitar parts.

This is virtually an encyclopedia of N.Y.C. dance music--no microchips anywhere carry so much verve, sex, or grit. Only in N.Y.C., however, do people dance a whole lot to encyclopedias, and I fear that if ""Don't Make Me Wait"" didn't convert the great out-there then the rest of this is doomed to a life of obscurity.

FALSE,B+,Stop the Clocks,Oasis,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15635,"
One of the many things I never got about this band was where the Beatles were. Where was the ebullience, the wit, the harmonies, God just the singing, and, uh, the songwriting? Cotton Mather made me understand that when Oasis say they love the Beatles they really mean they love the post-Help!, pre-Sgt. Pepper Beatles. Since that span encompasses Rubber Soul and Revolver, many would say tally ho, but (a) not me 'cause I love the Beatles start to finish and (b) only if you're writing songs as good as, uh, ""We Can Work It Out."" Instead Oasis, meaning loudmouth bro Noel Gallagher, write songs that resemble ""We Can Work It Out"" in thickened texture and momentum but not depth or charm, then add arena size in the swagger of the drums and the bigged-up vocals themselves. This band-selected best-of--two discs lasting 87 minutes, like an old-fashioned double-LP except it's only 18 tracks--capture their sonic moment as fully as any freelance music historian needs. A 2010 package repeats 11 of these songs and adds 16 others--too many, I say. Also, it omits the opening ""Rock 'n' Roll Star."" If ever there were guys whose message to the world is summed up by an opener called ""Rock 'n' Roll Star,"" it's these bigheads.

I didn't pay much heed to complaints that this album cheated Nigeria's other big juju star by fading his hot tracks early. After all, juju isn't supposed to begin and end the way mbaqanga or Europop does--songs are designed to segue together for nonstop dancing. And there are notable themes and spectacular sounds throughout. But since they never assert a collective identity, cheating Americans of the wholeness they look for in African music, I have to assume the fades are at least partly at fault.

FALSE,B+,Blond/Blonde,Frank Ocean,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16878,"
This indifferent melodist's coup d'art only comes into its own when he brings the noise--especially as of the clamorous ""Nights,"" which together with the 100-mph Andre 3000 rap and the rehearsal-tuneup chorale that follow add up to the only nine minutes on his stairway to nowhere that I'd call thrilling as well as admirable. Sometimes it's deeply admirable, true, like for instance the candidly awkward ""Good Guy,"" the telling ""Facebook Story"" tale, and Ocean's determination to rely on the musical authority of his expressive and capable but unathletic voice--I love the way ""Good Guy"" Auto-Tunes down. As on Channel Orange, however, his angst is a luxury of leisure--his wealth, hold the fame. Because some of his interpersonals could happen to anyone, his fans relate, and good for him. But most are specific to his social status. Why doesn't he whine more about the travails of stardom? Because he knows damn well how much he enjoys the freedom it affords him.

Without a doubt this is subtler and more durable than most slow, long-winded records, and half of it is terrific. She has her own sound, her simulated plainspeech strikes a blow for directness and honesty without committing her to any one thing, and if you think ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" cuts Taylor Dayne on the radio, wait till you hear ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" cut Aerosmith. Not since Patti Smith has anybody had a better chance of defining rock-not-pop in a specifically female way--she's just the right mess of emotion and savvy, crudity and sophistication, fury and independence and love. If there's anything that's older news than a 20-year-old who's angry at the world, it's a 23-year-old who's discovered life is worth living. But all that means is that if she can withstand the media flood, this won't be all that hard to top. How can she possibly know what she wants when she's only 23?

A/k/a Boogity-Shoogity, and I don't mean to be mean--I quite like these guys in limited doses. There are even good slow ones here. What's more, it's their funniest album ever, and that's no typo. Only I can't quite convince myself that artistic development is even a category for a group that is clearly pure Act if not pure Product. What I can do, however, is be glad that they make Earth, Wind &amp; Fire sound like the Herbie Mann Singers.

The title cut is single of the year, so I'm not surprised that it's unequaled here, but I wish something came close. Most will opt for ""Love Train,"" a propulsive flagwaver attached to UNESCO lyrics about people all over the world joining hands, presumably so they can't stab each other in the you-know-where. Me, I prefer the follow-up, ""992 Arguments,"" but ""I'm a Man"" or ""Baby Love"" it's not--more like ""It's the Same Old Song.""

If I were more conversant with the infinite shadings of African pop, I might get a sharper buzz off Okosun's panstylistic Afro-reggae, and I might be ready to settle for reassuring uplift if the two chants on Heartbeat's Black Star Liner sampler had been reserved for his U.S. debut. But as things stand, this sounds a little soft to me, just like the universalist-influenced politics that go with it. The curse of not-Marley strikes again.

For an African groove to buoy those of us who haven't been swimming in it since childhood, it has to be articulated in distinct detail, which is why I thank the engineers who popped each element out this time. Agile horn arrangements from a man called Dave also stir it up. As on Okosuns's Shanachie compilation, the lyrics (all but ""My Ancestors"" in English) are kind-hearted, militantly progressive, and a little simple--maybe too much so when he's following Nigeria's new leaders.

Dallas boys don't come to country naturally, not Dallas boys honest enough to open: ""This is the story of Victoria Lee/She started off on Percodan and ended up with me/She lived in Berkeley till the earthquake shook her loose/She lives in Texas now where nothing ever moves."" So ""You Belong to My Heart"" and ""My Sweet Blue-Eyed Darlin'"" fall as flat as their titles, and ""W-I-F-E"" says more about their own wimmin problems than about those of the ethos they poach so pseudosatirically. But in the back of a Bel Air with a mouthful of some girl's hair, staring at the dressing room walls blaming King Reagan for their wimmin problems, they're an uncommonly pungent bunch of alt-rockers with a sound they'll beef up yet.

They get depressed a lot, actually, so what say we lump them in with the new literalism, more Ass Ponys than Uncle Tupelo. Even if Rhett Miller really thinks love always turns out as bad as it does here--hell, even if he thinks third-rate romance is just a metaphor for the musician's lot--I still give him credit for keeping his eyes open. Convincer: ""Barrier Reef,"" which renders the high hopes and depressing mechanics of a critical one-night stand in equally quick and devastating strokes.

Well after you realize they have no business covering ""Rocks Off"" because they're not the Rolling Stones, ""Rocks Off"" continues to rock. Then there's a Fratellis song about fandom rescued from Britfan oblivion, an early R.E.M. song with every word enunciated by lit guy Rhett Miller, and David Bowie's greatest song with the possible exception of ""TVC-15"" (which, really now, isn't the Old 97's' kind of thing).

Floating airy synthesizers on the quietest of Paris-Kinshasa grooves, this Papa Wemba grad is class pop right down to his haircut. A balladeer by soukous standards, he's a rhythm king nevertheless, a cafe au lait Bing Crosby with the stuff to shoot from the hips. But for all its gentle carnality, his seductive one-on-one lacks emotional detail if you don't understand the words. Fluent Francophones will swoon--especially fluent female Francophones.

This took a lot longer to break through in the living room than it would have on the dance floor, so homebodies be patient. What makes the difference in the end is that Jam &amp; Lewis are letting their love man play the nasty guy--""Fake"" and ""Criticize"" take the offensive after ""Hearsay"" puts it sweetly. And unlike Jam &amp; Lewis's nasty girl, O'Neal has the vocal muscle (and biceps) to back his nasty up. What's more, the same muscle turns ""Sunshine"" into a confection you could take home to mother.

Middle America tells itself stories about normal life. The flourishes are too big and the musical colors too bright, the teller of tales a blonde looker who reaches out to heroic mommies and slaves of data entry and praises the company of girlfriends without abandoning her search for the perfect man. It's ""like trying to find Atlantis,"" but somewhere in there she does. ""I Love My Life,"" she concludes, and you can almost see how some normal person might. Not the truth--far from it. But not quite a lie. Probably because she's not middle-American at all. Australia--the promised land.

Prepunk and for that matter prepub, Peter Perrett may well have been an only one, and he fits in now only because this is such a tolerant and/or commercially desperate time. He's not ""power pop,"" of course--on record, at least, power's got nothing to do with it. With his lazy drawl tightrope-walking on the cusp of the love-death continuum, he's just a perversely if not insincerely wistful rock and roll balladeer who hopes you'll sleep with him and will get peeved if you don't--vulnerably seductive now, but don't be surprised if he quickly starts demanding specialties.

FALSE,B+,La Belle ������,Orchestra Baobab,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15733,"
This two-CD import has many discographical drawbacks. The adequate audio on the first disc, all or most of which was recorded live without audience in an empty club, could be more forceful and distinct. It shares the preponderance of its second disc with Nick Gold's On Verra ������������������a comp and a few tracks with the somewhat superior archive dig N'Wolof. Individual selections have been reinterpreted on Baobab's reunion CDs, picked up on this or that Afrocomp, and/or recycled on cheesier reissues. So as an economic matter this iteration of their early recordings, trending Latin and also often featuring Laye M'Boup--al""Yen Saay,"" which does have a studio sheen--may seem a redundant extravagance to some old fans. If so, however, I urge them to seek out not just ""Yen Saay"" but the gorgeous ""Baobab Gouye Gui""/""Geeja Ngala Riir""/""Samaxol Fatou Diop"" sequence, preceding it with ""Jarraf"" if they don't know N'Wolof, where it's called ""Yaraf.""

Clearly a first-rank band, they were also clearly a band without a true star on vocals or guitar. Since beyond a single drummer their music was all vocals and guitars, this is a limitation. Nor does the songcraft help much. So this lovingly conceived, skillfully engineered reconstruction from the big-holed, two-sided originals provides nine slightly subclassic soukous tracks averaging eight-and-a-half minutes apiece--in the East African manner, of course, which is less coruscating than its Congolese counterparts. Samba Mapangala does take the lead once, and it's fine listening throughout. But it's definitely for adepts of the style. Mastermind Doug Paterson's thorough notes include summaries of Lingala lyrics that are more woman-friendly than Afropop so often is.

FALSE,B+,Don't Stop,Jeffrey Osborne,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5581,"
Osborne proves that the secularization of black pop needn't mean the end of a great vocal tradition, only of its church roots, and he doesn't sing as if he learned how at Performing Arts, either. Instead he sounds like what he is--a son of the most uncompromised black secular music, funk. The slightly herky-jerk bent of his phrasing and pronunciation is geared to the rhythm, and when he bears down into a ballad he sounds fresher than more conventionally soulful singers. Of course, he also sounds stranger if you're not prepared, which is why the uninitiated will take more readily to the somewhat stronger material on Stay With Me Tonight. Me, I just got the message, and I've been playing both.

In-concert compilations are often incoherent, but the blues-style hard jive beloved of performer-turned-majordomo Otis has such formal integrity that this r&amp;b spectacular moves smoothly for four sides. Some of the featured players are no more than Otis's hired hands, including guitarist Shuggie O. But (in ascending order) Roy Milton, Big Joe Turner, Ivory Joe Hunter, Little (?)

Subtract the seven Aquemini and Stankonia tracks from this best-of and you're left with only one that could compete with them--the more-song-than-rap single ""The Whole World."" Everything else, including two other new tracks, streamlines the tangle-rooted funk of their must-own albums into a discernibly Southern G-funk that meditates on the constraints of life outside the law: hit-the-streets pep talk, Christmas carol, the shallow-as-its-title title track ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,"" and my favorite, the languid ""Crumblin' Herb,"" about doing what you can while you're still alive to inhale it. More pleasurable than most gangsta hedonism, yes--and all the early OutKast most will ever need.

The two rock and roll covers are unbelievably clumsy coming from country's great lost missing link, and not just rhythmwise--did he choose the teen protest ""Summertime Blues"" because his gerontologist thought it would do wonders for him? Nor are many of the originals worthy of the career-capping compilation I hope is on the way. But he has a lesson to teach both his cocky epigones (emotion and commitment) and his exhausted contemporaries (emotion and commitment '88). Sounds like he's learned some things, too--from premier contemporary George Jones, whose late work had the same phlegmy maturity and every-syllable-counts concentration until the emotion and commitment went out of him.

The attraction is a Luo elder named Joseph Nyamungu, who plays a droning, mbira-sounding eight-stringed lyre called the nyatiti and sings with built-in momentum and gruff command. His five tracks are all exciting in different ways, solo showcase included. The other five falter in direct correlation to how prominently they feature the white Londoners who brought Nyamungu and the rest of their Kenyan bandmates into the great world, with the all-Londoner instrumental ""Nabed Nade El Piny Ka--Rework (How Will I Love in This World)"" the nadir (and the Kenyan version of the same song on the somewhat ramshackle Sofrito: International Soundclash comp vastly superior). Kenyan beats carry two English-language songs in which one Londoner reflects on some aspect of modernity I can't make out and another expresses his all-too-patient love. Guest patron Damon Albarn's Farfisa wilds out on the Kenyan-dominated ""Odera Lwar"" before his Omnichord further dulls ""Margaret Okudo--Dub."" I know, this is all too schematic. Unfortunately, it's true. Also true: you'll love that nyatiti.

With the heretofore useless John Miles doing Plant (you barely notice when the man himself sneaks in for a song) and the heretofore unproven Jason Bonham doing Daddy (assuming Page isn't sampling Boom-Boom like everybody else, flesh and blood being no substitute for the real simulacrum in today's studio), side one is easily the best Zep rip ever recorded. Zep blooze, not Zep mythopoeia, with titles like ""Wasting My Time"" and ""Wanna Make Love""; Page's riffs are classic, which isn't to say anybody has or hasn't played them before, and the momentum is fierce and enormous. On side two the mostly ridiculous Chris Farlowe takes over, his unlistenable ""Hummingbird"" inspiring fond thoughts of Leon Russell. Jimmy and Jason should form a band, invite Plant as a courtesy, and hope he turns them down. If Miles won't do what he's told, Lenny Wolf will be happy to step in.

Two or three great songs and a fair number of pretty good ones--I'm especially partial to ""Karate,"" a bash-his-face wife-abuse song that deserves more attention than it's been getting, and ""Those Crazy Christians,"" where Paisley fulfills his God quotient by stating his distance so admiringly it'll do evangelicalism more good than an entire sacred album. But a lot of the time he's trying too hard to say too little or trying too clumsily to say too much, sometimes even with his trusty guitar. And the LL Cool J rap is just a flat-out embarrassment.

In which Parker finally justifies his abandonment of rock and roll outcry for self-referential studiocraft by more or less acknowledging the private sources of his bitterest protests. The male chauvinism he mocks in the opener is almost certainly his own, and the love he can't take for granted right afterwards is probably his wife's, which in the end proves more durable than he's afraid it will. That's why he's glad to have a glass jaw, why he's advised to ignore everything that sounds like chains, and why except for one misplaced complaint side two is a happy-to-ironic-to-credibly-sappy paean to a marriage that has lasted--talk about your miracle a minute--one whole year.

Parker's mild-mannered description of what happens to those stingy with, er, respect--""You might come home early and get your feelings hurt""--typifies his understated autofunk. Playing guitar, synthesizer, piano, and drums as well as his home bass, which doesn't sound like a lead instrument either, he serves up eight tunes that bump and/or swoon into ear and/or ass with undeniable and virtually unrecallable effectiveness. I like every one, really. But don't ask me which is which--or why it matters.

Parks is a naughty choirboy and Kathy Dalton is auditioning for the Broadway lead, but theatrical preciosity is all you can expect from a musical comedy concept album anyway.

The message seems to be that clones are cool, and the proof seems to be the predictable yet effective funktoons that dominate the album. But I remain an unreconstructed Yurrupean rationalist/individualist, and I wish there were a few more tracks as specific as ""Dr. Funkenstein"" and ""Sexy Body.""

Because it mixes music from all three George Clinton creations (including a new chant) and conveys a lot of the anarchic, participatory throb of a P. Funk concert, this live double serves a real function. But the recording doesn't do much justice to the music's bottom, or its top.

At its stoopidest (""Theme From the Black Hole,"" which features a ""toast to the boogie"" that goes--naturally--""Bottoms up!"") this makes Motor-Booty Affair sound like The Ring of the Nibelungenlied. But at its dumbest (""Party People,"" apparently a sincere title) it makes Motor-Booty Affair sound like ""Sex Machine"" or ""Get Off Your Ass and Jam."" And there's too much filler.

In which Parsons stakes his claim to everything he loves about country music--its bathos, its moral fervor, its sense of peril. Whether he's replicating these qualities in his own songs or finding them in the genuine article, his interpretations achieve the synthesis of skepticism and longing that drove him to devise country-rock in the first place. Physically, he isn't always up to what he knows--that's a folkie's voice cracking on ""She""--but he can be proud that the only track here that beats Tompall Glaser's ""Streets of Baltimore"" is his own ""Kiss the Children.""

I don't know why it took eight years, but after several botches on A&amp;M here it is, a satisfying live-posthumous from the inventor of country-rock, for which he is not to blame. All five A-songs are more forceful on GP, but these versions (recorded in downhome Hempstead, Long Island) have a grace and lightness that for once show off the advantages of folkie roots, as does the new stuff on side two.

FALSE,B+,My Tennessee Mountain Home,Dolly Parton,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1057,"
This concept album begins with the letter Dolly wrote her mom and dad when she was first pursuing her dreams on Music Row. Fortunately, its subject isn't Music Row, except by contrast. Unfortunately, its pastoral nostalgia, while always charming, is sometimes a little too pat. Sentimental masterpieces like the title track are no easier to come by than any other kind, and the slowed-down remake of ""In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)""--the early hit in which she declined to go back--doesn't add as much bite as this city boy needs.

Emphasizing Dolly's perky, upbeat side, this doesn't offer a single must-hear track, but it's remarkably consistent. Songs like ""When the Sun Goes Down Tomorrow"" (country girl goes home) and ""Preacher Tom"" (saving in the name of the Lord) reprise old themes with specificity and verve, and the covers from Emmylou Harris and Merle Haggard broaden her perspective without compromising it. Intensely pleasant.

How you respond to this quasi-concept album about (of all things) work, which offers exquisitely sung standards from Mel Tillis, Merle Travis, and (I swear it) Woody Guthrie as well as Parton originals almost as militant as the title hit, depends on your tolerance for fame-game schlock.

By devoting herself to Nelson Riddle and operetta, Sun City scab Linda Ronstadt has made boycotting painless, but her long-promised hookup with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris will be hard to resist if the vocal luxuries of the mainstream biz make you swoon. Acoustic country delving from ""Farther Along"" and Jimmie Rodgers to Kate McGarrigle and Linda Thompson, it's a slightly scholarly yet sometimes thrilling apotheosis of harmony--three voices that have triumphed in the winner-take-all of the marketplace making a go of cooperation. Free of tits, glitz, and syndrums for the first time in a decade, Parton's penetrating purity dominates the one-off as it once did country music history. The only one of the three who's had the courage of her roots recently, Harris sounds as thoughtful up front as she does in the backup roles that are her forte. And while Linda's plump soprano will always hint of creamed corn, she's a luscious side dish in this company.

FALSE,B+,Pacific Trim,Pavement,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2705,"
Not a maxisingle--an EP consisting entirely of recommended arcana, with the bonus of lyrics that actually (seem to) make sense. But note these stats: three songs totaling 7:44 for $6.98, with the prize-winning ""Gangsters &amp; Pranksters"" finishing at precisely 1:30. Why do you think they call it discretionary income?
"
FALSE,B+,2 Hot!,Peaches & Herb,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5634,"
Anyone who believes all black pop is ""disco,"" nothing more and nothing less, should analyze the outfront vocals and submerged grooves of this enthusiastically lascivious Freddie Perren trifle, which broke because disco DJs are willing to program whatever's danceable, not because AM DJs are willing to program whatever's listenable. And in the end it proved so listenable that ""Reunited"" established itself as an anachronistic smooch classic--the counterpart of ""Shake Your Groove Thing,"" a timely hoochy-cooch classic.

FALSE,B+,Twice the Fire,Peaches & Herb,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5635,"
There's not a bad cut on this album, and though there isn't a great one either I'll settle for ""Howz-about Some Love,"" the Sunshine Band song of the year, ""Roller-Skatin' Mate,"" the dance craze song of the year, and ""Love Lift,"" the neologistic song of the year. Boogaly-boop to you.

FALSE,B+,Pearl Harbor & the Explosions,Pearl Harbor & the Explosions,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5636,"
A rhythm band ought to have a better rhythm section--most of this rocks OK for DOR, but the funk beneath ""Get a Grip on Yourself,"" for instance, is stiff to no purpose. The riffs are hooky, though, and Pearl E. Gates is an independent--not to say insular--woman who knows what her habits cost. There are no tears on her pillow and she doesn't care if your aim is true, but she doesn't waste her energy on macha bluster, either--prefers the cutting remark and isn't above turning her wit on herself. Which does not mean she has any intention of ""reforming.""

FALSE,B+,I Can't Stand the Rain,Ann Peebles,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5637,"
After two hot albums that didn't sell and a smoldering single that did, Peebles slides into the best-selling Al Green groove and doesn't quite catch fire. Reason: neither her raw honey timbre nor her bright, direct personality give her much access to Green's incendiary guile. Salvation: the Hi rhythm team.
"
FALSE,B+,Tribb to JB,The Peeps of Soulfunk,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13831,"
Chuck D or no Chuck D, an album of James Brown covers has built-in limitations, the inexhaustibility of the originals prominent among them. But the live band proves equal to Brown's grooves, and hip-hop established his adaptability long ago. So the record respects the man enough to interpret and even amend him. Here be prologues and scratches, a woman giving ""Man's World"" what for and an elementary-school girl reciting ""King Heroin."" Best of all, here be a ""Make It Funky"" that names as many of Mr. Brown's works and disciples as Chuck can fit in.
"
FALSE,B+,Life Is a Song Worth Singing,Teddy Pendergrass,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3423,"
Romantic schlock at its sexiest and most honest. Pendergrass is in such control of his instrument that the more commonplace of the Sigma Sound orchestrations never spoil the mood, while the good ones--let's hear it for the sax breaks on ""Only You""--accent it the way they're supposed to. The key is that he's not belting much--except for one dull party number, everything is medium-tempo or slower. Pendergrass has a tendency to bluster when he belts, to come on too strong. The slow stuff--these aural seductions are hardly ""ballads""--plays up his vulnerability and gives his vocal textures room to breathe a little.
"
FALSE,B+,Workin' It Back,Teddy Pendergrass,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5599,"
Forget platonic love--this is platonic sex. I mean, the man is the best-known paraplegic in America; when he sings songs called ""Never Felt Like Dancin'"" or utters lines like ""The thought of your body has got me erect,"" their status as mere collections of signs is understood literally by his fans. And thus their status as fantasy can be approached literally as well. Helps that while only ""Love 4/2"" is up to, let us say, vintage Jerry Butler, just about every cut at least maintains the atmosphere. Also helps that he's transferred his vocal savvy to however much of his body he's got left.
"
FALSE,B+,Broadcasting From Home,Penguin Cafe Orchestra,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5601,"
Marginal differences count for plenty with these subtlety specialists. More emphatic production bespeaks sharper conception--sometimes dramatic, sometimes representational, sometimes self-consciously atmospheric. The music is ""better""--and therefore relatively (marginally) conventional. It's lost its incidental aura, and despite the instant appeal of compositions like ""Heartwind"" and ""Music for a Found Harmonium,"" an edge of charm.
"
FALSE,B+,The Art of Walking,Pere Ubu,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2722,"
It's impossible to wish these utopian singers of the industrial pastorale anything but the best. But between the passages of synthesizer buzz and the fond talk of birdies, fishies, and horsies (pace Patti, they do call it ""Horses""), you have to figure that neither Red Crayola's Mayo Thompson (in for Tom Herman) nor the one true God (David is now a Jehovah's Witness) is counseling anybody to rock out. Undestructive violence is a hard act to continue.
"
FALSE,B+,Ubu Live: Volume 1: 390 Degrees of Simulated Stereo,Pere Ubu,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5602,"
Recapping the Hearthan and Blank Records period that a born-again Crocus Behemoth will never look in the eye again, this is a find for fans who missed the early singles and the Datapanik EP (source of four songs, with another previously unreleased and seven more from The Modern Dance). Material and performance are fine, with variant lyrics and new guitar and synthesizer bits mitigating (though not eliminating) the redundancy factor. But most of these recordings were intended for reference only, and that's how they sound--devoid of aural presence. For demo addicts, tape traders, and incorrigible cultists like me.
"
FALSE,B+,Song of the Bailing Man,Pere Ubu,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5603,"
In his Jehovah's Witness phase--which could last the rest of his life--David Thomas is just like any other eccentric ""progressive."" With Mayo Thompson and Anton Fier replacing Ubu's two committed rockers on guitar and drums, the group can't carry him along on populist pulse anymore, which means that although Thomas's compositional ideas may be ""original"" and ""interesting""--and unlike most art-rock, this music deserves both adjectives--how compelling you find the gestalt depends on the power of Thomas's private obsessions. Once again the man outdoes himself--some of these lyrics actually read as poetry. But it's minor poetry for sure--his musings on the ineluctable wonder of the natural order go deeper than, say, Peter Hammill's damn fool doomsaying, but they're long on whimsy and short on tension. As Christian rock goes, it's smart stuff, but as Christian art goes I'll take Graham Greene.
"
FALSE,B+,The World Won't End,The Pernice Brothers,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6248,"
His title poised between wise promise and grim prediction, Joe Pernice chooses life because he can't stop the music, which last time conjured Hollies and this time channels Zombies--Odessey and Oracle, to be precise. Whiners with a knack for melody regularly make hay off admitting the girl was too good for them. Just buy my songs, they promise, and I'll prove I've learned my lesson, for now I can love. With thematic input from one of those girls, Pernice rests his stronger case on dulcet vocals bursting with emotion and melodies whose credulous surge inundates all references to suicide and such. I'm almost convinced. But not quite.
"
FALSE,B+,How the West Was Won,Peter Perrett,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17099,"
Rousing himself from a six-minute opener as shapeless as another nodder's stupor, the original Only One delivers a revealing collection of new songs in the adenoidal singsong he trademarked in his twenties and miraculously retains at 65. Blaming his inept life on society's cruelty to bison and laboratory rats (the lucky ones, he believes, get to starve themselves to death on crack), he swears an eternal love it's not at all clear he can follow through on. His biography, however, suggests otherwise--he's long been married to a designer as COPD-damaged as he is. Not a pretty picture. But a catchy and educational one.
"
FALSE,B+,Mystic Miracle Star,"Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and the Majestics",1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5605,"
Found the hypnogroove a little flat even for a Clash producer's reggae record until I discovered that the Majestics' bottom was two guys named LaVilla and Schwartz. But if they're more rock than rockers, they're perfect for the legendary Perry, who does a mean Dylan on harp and whose crazed rhyming puns and mystagogical patter sound like Marcus Garvey on Highway 61. Move over Jesu, here come Jah.
"
FALSE,B+,The Movie,Persian Gulf,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5607,"
Barking out lyrics loud and clear over an uncommonly forthright groove, Hal Shows led this band to a left-field EP debut two years back, and I wish he'd tried to repeat, because at album length his forthrightness gets out of hand. The world his best lyrics create isn't what the band's music makes it seem--it's an untrustworthy place where being a little crazy can help you get by, full of implicit regrets and sidelong insults and allusions that mean more than they add up to. But when he tries to spell things out in protest or satire, or boil them down into haiku, he seems less than a little crazy.
"
FALSE,B+,We Came to Play,The Persuasions,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5651,"
""You should never try to put a tuxedo on the funky blues,"" reads Richard Penniman's epigraph, but that doesn't mean they should go naked: Jimmy Hayes's bass pulse may be a wonder, but it isn't a trap set. The studio work here captures their live blend, but that's not quite enough--every lyric, melody, arrangement, and lead has to rank with those of ""Man, Oh Man"" or ""Walk on the Wild Side"" for an acappella album to call you back.
"
FALSE,B+,Spread the Word,The Persuasions,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3748,"
The offhand concept announced by the title--gospel and its dissemination--doesn't come out as sentimental as you might expect. Not counting ""The Lord's Prayer,"" the only straight gospel song here is ""When Jesus Comes,"" a millenarian vision that seems rather vague after the more detailed (and profane) utopia described in ""When I Leave These Prison Walls."" ""The Ten Commandments of Love,"" ""Heaven Help Us All,"" and ""Hymn #9"" (a Vietnam junkie song recommended to John Prine) all translate church metaphor into secular maxim, while ""Lean on Me"" and ""Without a Song"" apotheosize the pious commonplace. ""T.A. Thompson"" reveres a rev. And Bob Dylan's ""Three Angels""--one of the dopiest songs about religion ever written--is here transformed into apt intro and reprise.
"
FALSE,B+,Chirpin',The Persuasions,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3749,"
Those who agree with the group's in-it-for-love producer David Dashev that this disc is ""definitive"" find Jerry Lawson's deadpan interpretation of Tony Joe White's ""Willie and Laura Mae Jones"" and Joe Russell's solo claim on ""To Be Loved"" more resonant than I do. But I am impressed by the acappella anthem ""Lookin' for an Echo"" and the way they sustain ""Women and Drinkin'"" for seven minutes, and I really like the easy stuff: ""Papa Oom Mow Mow"" and ""Sixty Minute Man.""
"
FALSE,B+,Comin' at Ya,The Persuasions,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5655,"
The least ""contemporary"" record they've ever essayed--except for ""Love Me Like a Rock,"" all the material dates back to when their acappella style was a genuine urban folk response to what was on the radio--is uniformly listenable. It's also their first for this bluegrass-centered Chicago label, and thanks--here's what folkies are for.

FALSE,B+,Peter and the Test Tube Babies,Peter and the Test Tube Babies,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5608,"
In this time of micromargins and cults subdividing like paramecia, we gravitate toward bands that hark to whatever obscure titans we picked up on when obscurism was a harmless sideline. For me it was the Vibrators, the wildest and tightest of Britain's trad rockers in punk disguise, and I bet these guys were there. Despite the chiming expansiveness of the hooks and song lengths, they're the same nasty group, driven to drink by their microcultish prospects.
"
FALSE,B+,The Shit Factory,Peter and the Test Tube Babies,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6132,"
Maybe this delicious joke is wasted on the U.S.A., where we endure the middle-class schlock of Diane Warren rather than the lowbrow banality of the Stock/Aitken/Waterman these latter-day Britpunks vomit back so relentlessly. But the Rick Astley cover will connect--great chords never die, roit? And as an added attraction, ""Venus"" becomes ""Penis."" I think.
"
FALSE,B+,Release,Pet Shop Boys,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11211,"
Eventually, the tunes fall into place. What never materialize in sufficient number are the billowing climaxes and cutting remarks that mark their best albums, meaning most of them. Continuing their tragically heartening journey into normality, they provide several highly serviceable straight love songs, and I hope someone explains to me whether ""Birthday Boy"" is really Jesus or somebody just thinks so. And then there's the Eminem track. The Eminem track is . . . wondrous, transcendent, a blow against rap homophobia, a great work of art. If buying this album is the only way you can hear it, don't hesitate. Form a pool if you have to.
"
FALSE,B+,Full Moon Fever,Tom Petty,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3973,"
He wanted something off-the-cuff and got lucky: except for the punk putdown and the pseudo-Dylan throwaway, both nice on their own terms, nary a lyric nor tune clashes with the terrific early-Byrds cover. If guys made roots-rock albums anymore, anything here would spruce one up.
"
FALSE,B+,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3971,"
Addicts of updated nostalgia and rock and roll readymades should find this a sly and authentic commentary on the evolving dilemma of Harold Teen. The songs are cute, the riffs executed with more dynamism than usual, and the singing attractively phlegmy. And like they say at the end of other cartoons, that's all, folks.
"
FALSE,B+,Damn the Torpedoes,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3972,"
This is a breakthrough for Petty because for the first time the Heartbreakers (his Heartbreakers, this L.A.M.F. fan should specify) are rocking as powerfully as he's writing. But whether Petty has any need to rock out beyond the sheer doing of it--whether he has anything to say--remains shrouded in banality. Thus he establishes himself as the perfect rock and roller for those who want good--very good, because Petty really knows his stuff--rock and roll that can be forgotten as soon as the record or the concert is over, rock and roll that won't disturb your sleep, your conscience, or your precious bodily rhythms.
"
FALSE,B+,Let Me Up (I've Had Enough),Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5612,"
For such a downhome guy, Petty has a major instinct for the news hook. Here, after defying premium pricing, reconstructing the South, and touring with somebody famous, he exploits the Dylan connection once again. In the tradition of his new hero, Petty's plan was no plan--he and the guys just went into the studio and these songs came out. And whaddaya know? Stick the thing in your playback mechanism of choice and these songs come out--for the first time in his career, the man sounds like  the natural he's worked so hard at being.
"
FALSE,B+,Yuppie Drone,The Pheromones,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5660,"
Two folkie ""brothers"" with cheap electronic instruments as well as acoustic guitars. Also with half-decent day jobs, I bet--they know the texture of selling out. Their jabs at the international monetary system and the world leader they dub the Great Rondini are simple and telling, and there can never be too many of them.

FALSE,B+,Burnin',Esther Phillips,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5661,"
With her lubricious, naturally sardonic high vibrato, this modern blues singer is well equipped to carry Dinah Washington's torch, and a club date with the likes of Chuck Rainey and Cornell Dupree is the perfect place for her to shine her light--even the horn overdubs sound hot. But there are only three blues, and she doesn't bring quite enough to either the standards (""Shangri-La"" is the most regrettable) or the ""contemporary material"" (one Aretha, one Beatles) with which a nightclub pro fills out her act.
"
FALSE,B+,Performance,Esther Phillips,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5664,"
Phillips's adventurous material is one reason her jazzy pop blues are so lively, but here she's bested by Eugene McDaniels's ""Disposable Society"" (""They've thrown away sincerity, the keystone of integrity"") and Allen Toussaint's title tune (""I'm a thing that makes music they don't understand""). On the other hand, eight minutes of Chris Smithers's ""I Feel the Same"" seems just about right.
"
FALSE,B+,"You've Come a Long Way, Baby",Esther Phillips,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5668,"
Anyone who believes Creed Taylor is a neutral presence should check out Phillips on her own: using Kudu producer Pee Wee Ellis and the basic Kudu formula--mixing blues and standards and rock with MOR and disco crossovers--she comes up with her most consistent album of the '70s. She divvies up the sides, putting mostly crossover stuff on the B, where it holds its own. She takes on someone named Mischa Siegal to help Ellis with the string arrangements, which are discreet, more trim than wallpaper. And she does an extra blues. Not to mention ""Into the Mystic.""
"
FALSE,B+,Here's Esther . . . Are You Ready,Esther Phillips,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5670,"
Proving her resilience once again, this thirty-year-woman skates over ""Philadelphia Freedom"" with a lot more cool than Aretha managed on ""The Weight,"" explores her blues roots with a Ruby &amp; the Romantics cover, and gets good material out of what still looks suspiciously like a stable. Special plaudits to producer Harvey Mason, who reminds us that disco horns and strings are supposed to push push. Fave: the danceable get-down parody, ""Oo Oop Oo Oop.""
"
FALSE,B+,Good Black Is Hard to Crack,Esther Phillips,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8244,"
No longer the blueswoman slipping into a more fashionable rhythm, Phillips has made that light, guitar-accented dance beat her own, and here she pursues it without compromises--no violins or fancy horns, just the groove. Only occasionally is the material more than adequate, but to hear her twist a song's natural shape against the smooth pulse and background harmonies is to wonder which is going to crack first.
"
FALSE,B+,John Phillips,John Phillips,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5671,"
Phillips doesn't have a beautiful voice--that was Denny Doherty--but he can project as well as write, and most of these murmured reports from Topanga and Malibu are tossed off with a not unattractive noblesse oblige. Lou Adler's unhurried, witty, soul- and country-tinged production suits them perfectly. Elitist, perhaps, but more about leisure enjoyed in the wake of accomplishment than about the perquisites of money and power.

Kinda restores your faith in humanity for these guys to make like they know the difference between intelligent and pretentious. Page McConnell plays blues, Trey Anastasio plays Jerry, and David Byrne, ZZ Top, and the 19th-century team of Joe Howard and Ida Emerson beef up the fey songwriting. Plus you have to love their long overdue Doors interpolation: ""Mother . . . I want to cook you breakfast.""

Maybe I'm getting sated--how many jazz-classical-tango suites does a Yank rock and roller need? Still, as someone who never had much use for Red Headed Stranger, I note that the historical metaphor this time is the guapo--a ""hero or hoodlum,"" hold the hero. Also, the ruminative interludes suggest that Piazzolla's gift is for passion rather than romanticism.

FALSE,B+,In Philadelphia,Wilson Pickett,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4191,"
What the Gamble-Huff band does for Pickett, Pickett does for the Gamble-Huff songwriters. The way the horns mix Southern drawl and Northern speed-rap makes me nervous, and I wish side two slowed down with the oblique ""Help the Needy"" instead of the all-over-the-place ""Days Go By,"" but overall the musicians make the singer go and the singer makes the songs go.

FALSE,B+,100 Proof,Kellie Pickler,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15927,"
American Idol haunts this artistic breakthrough, a sense that she'll always sing what she's told no matter how many composition credits she bags--six out of 11 here, including only one of the three tough-talking openers without which I'd never have gotten to where ""Long As I Never See You Again"" started showing its muscle. But if making nice comes all too naturally, the ones about the daughter she doesn't have and the father she was stuck with say that love is something she's willing to tough out.

Six unhurried songs from a Vermont band given to satire (and music) whose hale, unsmartalecky tone could never happen in the city.

Armed with a Day-Glo dye job and some ace Babyface subcontracts, a tough talker diddles teenpop's love button. In a world where the half-word ""sh-"" teeters on the edge of going too far, she and hers bet-correctly-that a simple ""I'm pissed"" will pack a wallop, and work from there.

This has its share of obvious moments. But I can only assume that those who accuse this band of repetitious cynicism are stuck in such a cynical rut themselves that a piece of well-constructed political program music--how did we used to say it?--puts them uptight.

With the rerecorded ""Money"" sporting a livelier bottom to protect them from truth-in-titling and felonious injury charges, this gathers up their tuneful moments, which have always been far between--so far between, in fact, that even the unconverted may miss the ersatz symphonic structures in which they're properly embedded.

There's nothing especially forbidding or avant about these six Minneapolis boys, but chances are they'll never get to Milwaukee and not for lack of talent, though they could use a singer. It's just that they're obviously in it for the art. This is generic rock and roll for the sheer formal pleasure of it--now pop, now punk, now Stones, now nice, now nasty, usually nasty.

They're in love and they don't know why--with rock and roll, which is heartening in a time when so many college dropouts have lost touch with the verities. You can tell from the bruising riffs, the rousing choruses, the cute little bass melodies, the solid if changeable beat. But not from any words they sing. They'll improve in direct relation to their improved contact with the outside world. Getting famous too fast could ruin them.

The fairyland psychedelica and many-hued outfits on the cover led me to dismiss the music as camp satire or idiot nostalgia. But ""Euphoric Trapdoor Shoes"" and ""Rattail Comb"" work for their laughs, and other songs achieve an even greater complexity of tone. The group's Anglophile diction can be prissy or sarcastic or acid-wild; their music is gimmicky and even silly sometimes, but like ""She's a Rainbow"" or ""Itchycoo Park"" it's also melodic and pleasurable and strong. Almost alone among the neopsychedelics, they actually have something to say about the '60s: they understand that to write lines like ""Loneliness is a sad companion/Loveliness is all she feels"" may well mean you're foolish but doesn't necessarily make you a fool.

In its heretical return to a time-honored people's form, its appropriation of available spiritual values as an antidote to materialist oppression, and its embrace of the Christ who ""blasphemed against the order of the world,"" this smuggled religious message from the long-suffering Czech anarchists makes perfect sense. Out of context, however, it's a little hard to take--happy though I am to have a trot, I don't find myself personally enriched when I read along with the Biblical texts and stories. And despite the obsessive bass lines and ostinatos, the only ""rock"" it brings to mind is Henry Cow, which on a strictly compositional level seems purer to me. But that's not to say that this whatever-it-is music, masterminded by free saxophonist Vratislav Brabanec, isn't satisfying on its own terms--or to mention that side two, especially the long, painful ""Father, Father,"" makes my stomach churn every time I concentrate.

Having been left tepid by Irish music from the Chieftains to Clannad, I filed this after a token try. Drumbeats or no drumbeats, I figured it was just beyond me. And some of it is--reels that aren't rockin', accents further garbled in the speedfolk rush.

Imagine the Mighty Lemon Drops with extra percussion singing about breakfast, sex, and wonder in a place where central heating just isn't an issue. Honolulu, Austin, what's the dif? They're Sun Belt hippies either way, glad to be alive where the living is easy.

Entranced by the commercial potential of this novelty act, I forgot how novelty acts translate to plastic. The Upfront Horns overstep themselves by half, the inflections are too Jolson for their own good, and even if the television audience is never the wiser, the material is pretty obvious. I want more ""Screwy Music"" and ""Hot Hot Hot,"" less ""Smack Dab in the Middle"" and ""Good Morning, Judge."" And while it's kinda hip to pick up on songs that Al and Aretha were covering back when you favored fishnet hose, it's also foolhardy, especially when you're hard pressed to beat Eric Burdon at ""House of the Rising Sun.""

Thanks to (coproducer) Berry Gordy and the miracle of modern multitracking, Bonnie makes like the Marvelettes of your dreams for an entire side. People didn't conceive vocals this intricate and funky back in Motown's prime, much less overdub them single-larynxed, and the result is remakes that outdo the originals--by Brenda Holloway and the Elgins--and originals that stand alongside. The other side comprises originals of more diminutive stature cowritten by (coproducer) Jeffrey Bowen. (Catalogue number: M7-911R1).

FALSE,B+,The Best of the Pointer Sisters,The Pointer Sisters,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5699,"
I realize in retrospect that I didn't like how they sounded mostly because I didn't like what they portended--camp-elegant escapist nostalgia--less liberating than Bette or Dr. Buzzard, but less reactionary than Manhattan Transfer or whoever's breaking out of the boites this month. Church roots help, and not just vocally--their superb taste (from Dizzy Gillespie to Allen Toussaint) has a moral center expressed in songs of their own like ""Jada,"" a generation-gap lyric that ranks with ""Handbags and Gladrags,"" and ""Shakey Flat,"" about moving to the country from an actual city. What's more, someone seems to know when they're good--with David Rubinson putting his twenty grand in, they've committed a lot of excesses and banalities, but not too many survive on this compilation.

It's supposed to be tragic that these long-running pros have walked away from America's rich musical heritage in pursuit of the pop buck, but as someone who's always had his doubts about their historical depth, I think the electrodance they settle on here suits them fine. Certainly Richard Perry has assigned songs that throw the new style in your face--titles like ""Automatic"" and ""Neutron Dance"" and ""Dance Electric"" may offend those who wish they still dressed like the Savoy.

Hard rock trash as radio readymades, these cheerful young phonies earn their Gene Simmons cover art. A residue of metal principle spoiled the top 40 on their debut, but here they sell out like they know this stuff is only good when it's really shitty.

It's pointless to deny that they make the chops work for the common good--both their trickiness and their simplicity provide consistent pleasure here. But with drummer, manager, and booking agent all scions of a CIA honcho, I have my doubts about their standing as a progressive force. Whether you're following in the old man's footsteps, offing the motherfucker, or striving for a livable compromise, roots like that leave you twisted, if only to the tune of a middlebrow clich������""There is no political solution."" In the kindest construction, say their politics are as astute, liberal, and well-meaning as those of Pete ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" Townshend, who also needs reminding that we're not just spirits in the material world--we're also matter in the material world, which is why things get sticky.

I prefer my musical watersheds juicier than this latest installment in their snazzy pop saga, and my rock middlebrows zanier, or at least nicer. If only the single of the summer was a little more ambiguous, so we could hear it as a poem of mistrust to the Pope or the Secretary of State; instead, Sting wears his sexual resentment on his chord changes like a closet ""American Woman"" fan, reserving the ambiguity for his Jungian conundrums, which I'm sure deserve no better.

Amid the sludge of Yew Ess Ay 1977, the chiming, slightly tinny British Invasion tributes of these pioneering L.A. power poppers were as daring formally as their self-distributed album was politically. Two years later everybody's doing it and their synthesis has become correspondingly fuller and more intricate, incorporating Anglophile moves that range from Roxy Music automation to Clashy football-cheer backup vocals. Still missing are depth of vision (these are power poppers, after all) and killer hooks (aren't they?).

This album provides what it advertises only to those who consider Iggy a font of natural wisdom--there are such people, you know.

Play this a few times and in two years you'll still recall five songs when you put it on again: ""Dog Food,"" ""I Snub You,"" ""Loco Mosquito,"" ""I'm a Conservative,"" ""Play it Safe.""

Peulhs have their own culture, which neighboring peoples feel in sharper detail than I can. So for me Poulo's eight songs in 35 minutes captivate as West African with a twist, softening those circular grooves with singing more dulcet than, say, genteel Rokia Traor������������������'s, never mind alarm-bell Noura Mint Seymali's. Although the grooves ride the Peulh variant of the strummed and plucked ngoni lute, they come into their own when a one-stringed violin the Peulhs call a soku echoes the vocal line. The press release indicates that Poulo's lyrics praise traders, blacksmiths, a marabout, and of course her patrons. But what tourists like us grok is"

Paddy McAloon is a type we've met many times before--the well-meaning cad. Expressing himself with a grace befitting an intimate of Faron Young and ""Georgie"" Gershwin, he's sweet enough to come out on the losing side sometimes, but in the end he'll probably ""let that lovely creature down,"" because he can't resist a piece of ass. J.D. Considine calls this music ""Steely Dan Lite,"" which suggests the crucial contribution of producer-sideman Thomas Dolby but misses its pop-folk roots. Reminds me more of the justly obscure, unjustly forgotten Jo Mama--or of Aztec Camera if Roddy Frame were a cad.

As an evangelical tool, white gospel balances the sweet and the sententious the way ""Reach Out to Jesus"" does, but too often it topples like ""An Evening Prayer,"" and guess in which direction. Still, Elvis doesn't toss this stuff off--he hasn't sung with such consistent care since his comeback was at stake. And just like black gospel (fancy that), ""sacred"" music isn't always solemn--half the time it's fast enough to pass for rock and roll. In fact, for a counterpart to the airy intensity and passionate grace of ""I, John"" you might have to go back to the Sun recordings.

The idea is to remove the goop--strings, horns, choruses--from nondescript '70s album tracks, shuffle 'em up good, and call it ""pure Elvis."" But though Volume 1 was a bare-faced exploitation, this one happens to work. Maybe someone figured the potential market hated goop of any kind. In any case, the song selection is neat, including ""Green Green Grass of Home,"" ""Thinking About You,"" the lovely ""I Can Help,"" and a previously unreleased ""studio jam session"" on Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice"" that is actually too long at 8:36. The mix is weird--I hear imperfectly erased goop ghosts on ""Way Down,"" for instance--but as near as I can tell this is EP's best pop album of the decade.

In which the pre-RCA tyro finds a groove while making nice for squealing young country fans. What's amazing about the groove is that it's drumless, loose if not at all improvised, far more like blues and/or folk music than even his earliest studio work. What's amazing about the nice is how lascivious it is--when he invites his gal to ""do what we done before"" in ""Baby Let's Play House,"" you can just about see her legs sticking over the back of the couch.

The medium-priced four-to-six-track twelve-inch is introductory product suited to young bands who are getting their songwriting shit together (or have already shot their songwriting wad). For this young band, however, it's interim product--two singles that went nowhere on the charts, one B side that goes nowhere period, one B side that goes to Cuba with Bo Diddley, and a live version of a single that already went somewhere (though live it goes even further). All of it you've heard before, and some of it you'll hear again, when they get their follow-up album shit together.

Anyway, it's always the words I remember, not the melodies. I mean, I never thought they were such hookmeisters to begin with, but at times this relies so much on texture and flow it sounds like a punk Hissing of Summer Lawns.

Price was the biggest, roughest shouter in New Orleans r&amp;b, and gumbo aficionados will tell you it was a tragedy when those bad Northerners stole him away. Price didn't agree, and I know what he means. Even honed down to 14 tracks in 36 minutes over Dave Bartholomew's ace band, his Specialty material is so unthinkingly generic that few of the songs distinguish themselves even as novelties. In addition to Price's signature ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy,"" which I like no less and also no more in this lowdown version than as the sub-two-minute rocker ABC-Paramount made of it, my best candidate would be the accurately entitled ""Oo-Ee Baby,"" which no one has ever heard of because it ain't all that novel. Nevertheless, this is pretty entertaining for a historical document, and it's augmented by the label's generic 26-minute bonus disc, which you'll probably play more: 10 r&amp;b classics that include Roy Milton's ""R.M.

For anyone who calls herself country to blame women's troubles on ""rich white men"" is a miraculous thing, as is a title closer that remembers when ""Reagan was selling weapons to the leaders of Iran."" But singing a lyric isn't the same as driving it home, and she should never have removed the echo from a soft-edged soprano that needs all the vulgarity it can enact. I admire the one she has the brass to call ""Pay Gap."" But I respond more naturally to the losing-the-farm saga ""Heart of America,"" which blames ""the big banks"" like it should, and the self-determined ""Loner,"" which warns ""You get what you pay for, sometimes you pay twice.""

As someone who saw the title film stoned in 1971, and loved it, I agree that this is one of the few putatively psychedelic albums ever to evoke the distractible ecstasy of actual psychedelic experience, flitting from detail to fascinating, ultimately meaningless detail. Crucially, the moods and referents that flash past are anchored by tunes and sounds so simple a zonked zombie can relate to them. But as someone not altogether dismissive of the cofeature, Panic in Needle Park (Charles Theater on Avenue B, you could look it up), I must also note that, pace the highly apposite Stones rip that takes the trip back to earth, ""medication"" has never killed a hole that didn't come back gaping the next morning--a corny truth that renders this an achievement best admired from a sane distance.

He's a talented little guy, and this has plenty of pizzazz. But I'll take The Black Album's fat-bottomed whomp over its attention-grabbing beats and halfway decent tunes any day, and despite appearances it sure ain't where he explains why sexiness is next to godliness--lyrically it's sloppy if not pseudo if not stupid. This is doubly bothersome because added religious content is what it's supposed to have over its not terribly shocking alternative. Leading one to the obvious conclusion that the real reason the little guy made the switch was that he was scared to reveal how, shall we say, unpop he could be.

On his third studio double in a decade, he's definitely cheating. Half the music isn't really his, and the other half is overly subtle if not rehashed or just weak: title track, generational anthem, and lead single all reprise familiar themes, and the ballads fall short of the exquisite vocalese that can make his slow ones sing. But some of the subtle stuff--""Tick, Tick Bang""'s PE-style electrobeats, say--is pretty out, most of the received stuff is pretty surefire, and from unknowns to old pros, his cameos earn their billings. Also, there's half a great Time album here--did he steal it or just conceive it?

Take as a given that this is an overpriced exploitation or indulgence, depending on your point of view--that is, whether you're Prince or not. The two discs of A sides are indeed choice, but most come from albums that yield more choice (not to say choicer) stuff, and their recontextualization isn't as jaw-dropping as an admirer of our greatest popular musician might hope. Whether the duplications merit the tariff you can decide for yourself. So would the B sides justify purchase on their own were the little man so generous as to make them available as such (or were the world to end, whichever comes first)? And the answer is: maybe. The porny stuff--especially ""Irresistible Bitch,"" ""Scarlet Pussy,"" the wicked ""Feel U Up,"" and the absolutely classic ""Erotic City""--is must-hear for any sex fan. The funky stuff is fonky. The dog bit is like bow-wow. And the ballads are of every description, including godawful.

What I loved most about 1992 Deluxe was its spunk. Biting off and shaping up her girly voice into a lively signature flow, a runway rapper with pan-Manhattan attitude put ""my little titties and my fat belly"" in hip-hop's face and claimed street for an Afro-diasporic bohemia of her own devising. So of course I was disappointed when she went sad-sack emo on a mixtape timed to vie with Cardi. But soon I caught it catching my ear the way sad-sack anything seldom does. ""Goth as fuck,"" as she once bragged, she's not always so confident, and she wants us to know it. Her auto-tunelets range sad to determined, hopeful to boastful, hostile to empathetic. Depressive as fuck but nothing like self-indulgent, she tries to be not just honest but nice about it.

In the title tune, Prine reports that he's transcended his anger, and I'm happy for him, but a little worried about his music. Common Sense was agitated to the point of psychosis, but it had an obsessive logic nevertheless. Here Prine sounds like he's singing us bedtime stories, and while the gently humorous mood is attractive, at times it makes this ""crooked piece of time that we live in"" seem as harmless and corny as producer Steve Goodman's background moves; no accident that the closer, ""The Hobo Song,"" is Prine's most mawkish lyric to date. Still, Edward Lear's got nothing on this boy for meaningful nonsense, and just to prove he's still got the stuff he collaborates with Phil Spector on a surefile standard: ""If You Don't Want My Love,"" with lyrics worthy of its title.

Prine's reappearance on his own label suggests that the reasons for his absence were more corporate than personal. The songs suggest that he's not reading True Love on the back cover for solace or satire. Only ""The Bottomless Lake,"" copyrighted in 1977, falls into his wild-ass whimsy mode, and only the musically retiring ""Maureen, Maureen"" gets any more acerbic than that.

Just in case you were wondering, this relaxed, confident album is where Prine comes out and admits he's a folkie, opening with an A.P. Carter tune he's been performing for a quarter century and commandeering sidemen from New Grass Revival and suchlike. The songs are straightforward and homemade, their great theme the varied love life of a man whose wife Rachel plays bass and sings harmony here and there, though not on the extended beer commercial ""Out of Love,"" nor on ""Bad Boy,"" about ""how to be guilty without being Catholic.""

Not bad for profit taking. The melodies are at their ingratiating schlock-classical best, the tempos up enough to render the lyrics extraneous. Among the four never-on-LP inducements are ""Lime Street Blues,"" a jolly barrelhouse that mentions underpants, and ""Homburg,"" which introduces their ""multilingual business friend."" But the old stuff reminds us that Keith Reid once knew writing can be a goof--even his ""commercial"" lyrics from the '70s (""Simple Sister,"" ""Whiskey Train"") are self-servingly arrogant. And the Gary-Brooker's-greatest format demonstrates conclusively that he learned his oft-praised blues mannerisms from the constipated guy in the next toilet stall.

The hardcore debut of 1983 doesn't sound very hardcore, which may not bode well for the movement--this is like a more rigorous, less cosmic PIL. There's a touch too much Geddy Lee in Richard Brown's vocals, but he sure doesn't think like Geddy Lee--avoiding tantrum and who-am-I?, these spare slogans are underpinned by actual left theory, though not much practice.

Their 2009 debut LP is palpably younger--slightly quicker and considerably more high-flown, the vocals longer on forced scansion and childish drawl. The tune prospecting is almost as astute, however, and topped off lyrically by the 20-is-forever fight song ""Tennessee"" (""Baby let's push our limits"") and the tell-me-your-feelings critique ""Like Who You Are"" (""We always discontinue what we don't misconstrue"").

Tired of the sardonic fake Pistolese, Richard Butler turns his heartfelt dispassion to an approach that bears the same relation to Bowieism as the earlier Furs did to punk. His seducerama is in the manner of an aging matinee idol who isn't quite as famous as he thinks he is; he sings as if he's known you for years even though you're both perfectly aware that so far your relationship goes no further than his offer of a lift back to your place. And if you're feeling detached enough yourself, you just may take him up on it.

It may seem redundant to accuse a rapper of arrogance, like accusing a politician of seeking power, but Chuck D takes the bully-boy orotundity of his school of rap elocution into a realm of vocal self-involvement worthy of Pavarotti, Steve Perry, or the preacher at a Richard Pryor funeral. And while I know the idea is to play him off the wheedling motor-mouth of his boy Flavor-Flav, why should I like the great man's fan any more than I like the great man? They've got literary chops--amid puns more Elvis Costello than Peter Tosh, their ""Megablast"" is cutting anticrack narrative-propaganda--and they make something personal of rap's ranking minimalist groove. But there's no fun in these guys, which given the intrinsic austerity of the groove means not much generosity either.

This is going along fine, politicizing indefatigably with cameo help from super-scratcher Davy DMX, saxophone pro Gerald Albright, Otis-channeling soul sister Sheila Brody, and Ziggy Marley 10,000 dutchies on, when finally, midway through, here comes some madman with the deeply stoopid ""31 Flavors"" and you realize it wasn't going along fine enough. Flav even contributes a superior Otis homage, about cars, and sells the irresistible ""Broke Diva,"" in which Chuck joins an attack on gold-diggers I have the feeling Mrs. Chuck could do without. To compensate, the boss ropes the celebreality money-grubber into an attack on ""Fame.""

FALSE,B+,Album,Public Image Ltd.,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2836,"
John Lydon's name on the sticker, combined with his sudden eagerness to shoot the shit with representatives of the press, has everybody confused. This isn't a Lydon record that (the conveniently uncredited) Bill Laswell happened to produce, it's a Laswell record custom-designed for Lydon, with whom the auteur shares a disappointed revolutionary's professional interest in power. Just abstract the production style Laswell's adapted to artists as diverse as Mick Jagger and Herbie Hancock, think Sex Pistols, and you'll get something like this, as clinical as brain surgery and as impersonal as a battering ram, with unlikely virtuosos playing the Cook and Jones parts. It kicks in because they're both cold bastards; it feels out of whack anyway because Lydon can't match Laswell's commitment and still has too much integrity to fake it (and maybe also because he has never been in the same room with most of the musicians in this ""band"").

They seem like nice boys and they certainly have nice voices, but whole glee clubs of cousins from Florida could claim the same. The enduring value of their pop soul is a bizzers' triumph--from Muscle Shoals backing, to Don Penn and Steve Cropper filler, to this vinyl document, selected and annotated by Mitchell Cohen to finesse whole paragraphs of invidious comparison.

Vanessa Ellison's bellowed admonitions, Randy Bewley's guitar gradients, Michael Lachowski's peripatetic bass, and Curtis Crowe's prodigious roundhouse drumming add up to an unmistakable sound. I'm impressed. But I wish they'd come up with a few more riffs/melodies as deliberate and haunting as those of ""Volume"" and ""Stop It"" and the foolishly omitted ""Cool."" And while I admire their bare-boned lyrical concept, often the unpretentiousness seems mannered, like some comp-lit cross between Robbe-Grillet and Ted Berrigan.

Thirty-three years after the fact, a double-vinyl live album completes the catalogue of Vanessa Briscoe's DOR skyrockets from Athens G-A. Because it documents their very last show, recorded before an enraptured local audience on December 1, 1983, I had major hopes. But since like all live recordings it's subject to audio, pace, and pheromone deficits, I'm obliged to report that it only takes off second half--there are rumblings throughout, sure, but I hear ""Feast on My Heart"" as the turning point and side four as the must-play. My favorite is the one song I didn't know and also the finale: ""Party Zone."" I also appreciate the zooming encore: the Batman theme.

A success story whose taste in beats has always run pop, she vowed to ""burn MC's like calories"" and was off the charts in a month for her trouble. Oh well--if Chuck D can't get respect with Spike Lee behind him, what can a fat-flaunting, sitcom-fronting, dyke-playing woman expect? Here's hoping she swings every way she wants and recommending her sexual ambivalence to females everywhere. Things get bland and icky, especially when designated ingenue Inaya Jafan makes nice to the fellas, but the thematic ""Yes/No"" is educational right down to its tender skit. And for what it's worth, by the end of the record she seems to be proposing to the guy it's aimed at. Really, 28 isn't too old--and Latifah knows it.

The solid heads and well-schooled solos of John Gilmore, Marshall Allen, and the former Herman Blount are avant-trad at its most accessible, but note that the melodic panjazz swing showcased here is far more human-sounding and heartbeat-anchored than the children of Star Wars and videogames expect of ""easy listening for intergalactic travel."" Orbital fans out to slake their craving for strange should make room in their budget for one of the DIY albums where these 18 nonhits began.

Moorish and/or North African Spain is the idea, beginning with a flamenco colombiana--a folkloric variant that arose in the '30s claiming cross-Atlantic roots, only the hook goes to a Renaissance oboe called a cromornos, one of many medieval instruments on display. Which means that in a time when sensitivity to the Euro-Arab nexus is the way of both justice and survival, what's most original about this band is its translation of medieval into modern--which does constitute a sonic reminder that European culture isn't as pure as Silvio Berlusconi believes. What's most entertaining about it, meanwhile, is its new embrace of the supple and the songful. What's most annoying about it is its fusion and art-rock retentions.

Makan Ganessy will lose you everywhere but the entranced ""Mady Guindo""; Salif Keita will make life worth living on ""Maki"" even if ""Soyomba"" then disappoints.

Marcellus Hall represents Manhattan art-slackerdom like the proud denizen he is.

In their dubious pro-am musicianship and unavoidably spacy ambience, both of Rough Trade's very modern girl groups recall late-'60s art-rock of the Cantabrigian school--Kevin Ayers, Soft Machine, that ilk. But where Essential Logic also recalls art-rock of the Juilliard school, the Raincoats' punk-goes-folk-rock feels friendly even in its arty hostility. If the tentativeness of the rhythms and vocals is accentuated by the medium tempos they prefer, the unevenness of their songwriting means some of it is very good. Sure the multiple genderfuck ""Lola"" is what sucks you in, but you may end up preferring the other side. As with Lora Logic's sax, the signature and hook is Vicky Aspinall's violin, which she saws rather than plays.

I hate to be schematic, but they ask for it: for the first 10 tracks, the songs alternate in lockstep, Ana Da Silva-Gina Birch and forgettable-remarkable. What puts this comeback over the top is that the last two go Birch-Da Silva remarkable-remarkable--the literal ""Love a Loser,"" which should be a single if only because the infertility fantasy and the old-age fantasy and even the pretty fantasy are a little too remarkable for MTV, and Da Silva's title tune, which summons empathy for a jilted stalker who ends up getting hold of his fantasies. And as always, only at a higher level of instrumental expertise, the band's musical charms are coextensive with its limitations.

Factory alternative neither the jug-band-with-piano ""Hustlin' Blues,"" where she turns her pimp over to the law, nor the loose-limbed New Orleans ""Sissy Blues,"" where her man samples transvestite jellyroll. But they do include the title song, a historically accurate alternative to the identically named August Wilson play without which the album would not exist, ""Sleep Talking Blues,"" in which revenge doesn't cheer her up much, and ""Shave 'Em Dry Blues,"" in which adultery is quick, hard, and good for what ails her.

All but the schlockiest variants of what must still be called mainstream rock are listing toward marginality so fast that soon the whole genre will be a purist specialty like white blues. Overlooking a few organ arpeggios and obvious guitar solos, these four Adrian Belew-produced Ohioans do their passion proud, with Rob Fetters's funny but not parodic (or slavish) Springsteen impression on ""Miserable World"" a typical high point. The songs stick, too, though the lyrics are matter-of-fact enough about bent sex to make me wonder what the really kinky people in Cincinnati are like. Then again, in Cincinnati a purist mainstream rock band may well define kinky.

I suppose I should blame Peter Asher for how flat a few of these songs sound, but in fact I blame him only for pianist Don Grolnick, who single-handedly (well, actually I guess he used two) transforms the title cut from a cry of alcoholic despair to a self-pitying piece of hightone lounge schlock. She's never sounded better on the slow ones--Hayes-Porter's ""Your Good Thing"" is the killer--and her own ""Standing by the Same Old Love"" adds significantly to the pitiful store of rock songs about enduring sexual relationships. But I could stand some more hard raunch.

The nicest Ramone, who was revealing his secret identity well before he knew he had cancer, stands tall as a gentle goof, sounding contemplative partly because he's slowed down a little, partly because music has speeded up a little, and partly because he is. Spareness bleeds into vagueness, minimalism into unfinished business, which may be how he would have wanted these songs but isn't necessarily how we want them. Nevertheless, his ashram seeker is the perfect counterweight to his financial analyst, ""What a Wonderful World"" to ""1969."" And when he writes from his bed of pain it really hurts.
"
FALSE,B+,End of the Century,Ramones,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3798,"
Sad. The best cut is ""I'm Affected"" (note double-edged title); the second best is a Ronettes remake (Joey outsings Andy Kim); the third best is a ballad about their manager (now departed). They also remake two of their own songs--""Judy Is a Punk"" (good sequel) and ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" (unnecessary Spectorization)--and one of the Heartbreakers' (inferior). And take on the Sports and Joe Jackson with a song about the radio that would be the worst they'd ever written were it not for ""This Ain't Havana"" and ""High Risk Insurance,"" in which the group's reactionary political instincts finally escape that invisible ironic shield (bet Johnny provided worse-than-Barry-McGuire rhymes like ""on your way to life's promotion/You hinder it with emotion""). Phil Spector doesn't make that much difference; his guitar overdubs are worse than his orchestrations, and they're not uncute. But this band sounds tired.

Even if ""Animal Boy"" and ""Ape Man Hop"" were code for B-boy, which they're not, this wouldn't keep the promise of the remixed and retitled ""My Head Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg),"" because these days code is too fucking subtle. And what we get instead is jungle bunnies, two (pretty good) songs about Joey's drinking, another (not so good) one about his misery, Dee Dee one-for-three, the defensive-sounding ""She Belongs to Me,"" the defensive-sounding ""Crummy Stuff,"" and an anthem I believe called ""Something to Believe In.""

Sacred steel boogies, with better songs than are normally required or do I mean inspired at jamworld's secular camp meetings. Two Carlos Santana cameos add flash and a thickness, and when they cover ""Love Rollercoaster"" you'll swear they snuck Bootsy in the side door. Respect to Tedeschi-Trucks, absolutely.

Talk about acid casualties--these guys are victims of psychedelica even if they never touched the stuff. But those who ignore the atrocious title and listen to the songs are in for a surprise, because this is no Freedom Suite. In fact, it may be their most consistent regular-release LP--only one waste cut per side. If the Rascals are spouting universalist truisms, so is every other soul band these days--usually without coming up with anything as original or unpretentious as the warmly tongue-in-cheek ""Right On."" The only problem is that that's the high point--no new classics for Aretha to cover. Special surprise: Dino Danelli's modal jazz instrumental ""Name.""

As a somewhat skeptical admirer of Jim Podrasky's country-rock popcraft--how much can so static a commodity be worth in these careening times?--I was irritated at first by the big drum sound, tacked on to this pop product as it is to all others in these conformist times. Only when startled from a revery induced by a competing commodity did I realize that cowriter Terry Wilson's indubitable guitar-banjo-lapsteel-keybs-etc. demanded the percussive kinetics. The boy can't be stopped, his virtuosity serving a song-form rock and roll that's implosive rather than onrocking, pyrotechnic rather than jet-propelled. Even when Podrasky's romantic headaches and American tragedies aren't at a peak of observation, you listen. When they are, you learn.

Resistant though I am to the seductions of falsetto romanticism, the reincarnated Moments generate a Persuasions-like formal intensity with a few simple gimmicks--studio patter, apparently impromptu acappella codas, fast songs.

Ray Parker's idea is to synthesize the old black-music tradition of the male vocal group with the new one of the self-contained funk band, and here he proves that he has what it takes as a composer to keep the idea going.

Arranged chronologically in order of recording and release, these five two-sided singles, one three-song mini-EP, and one split seven-inch cohered better in their original formats--in sequence, the internally consistent comic-book gothic ""Trapped Here""/""Hiding Hole""/""DOA"" and sad-sack romance ""No Time""/""You Were Sleeping"" undercut rather than augment each other. It's not like Reatard is up to the level of classic Buzzcocks or something--his real but inconsistent pop gift can use a little shaping.

On record, he's an exemplary folkie, making up in organizational intelligence what he lacks in inventive spark. Melding antique songs of varying origin into a mature New Orleans instrumentation absent from his unaccompanied stage appearances--which are at first intriguing, then stultifying and/or annoying--he offers an alternative to the narrowness of both stylistic commitment and audio reproduction that makes the original New Orleans recordings inaccessible. Worthwhile work.

Beyond sacred schlock-by-association and rock and roll gifts, Christmas is a pop holiday that plays best in the background, which suits Redbone's forgettable old-timey lassitude. Who needs a major stylist interpreting ""White Christmas"" and ""Frosty the Snowman""? Both material and occasion call for a pleasantly anonymous medium, and if he sticks in a pleasantly distinctive obscurity like the hula-tinged title tune, don't look it in the chord changes.

Atlantic is obviously scraping bottom on Otis--there's nothing here I'd play to prove he was the greatest soul singer who ever lived, and several of the performances sound exploratory. But almost every track offers some special moment--the curly little horn part on ""Give Away None of My Love,"" Otis's offer to bet ""five dollars and a quarter or even more"" on ""Snatch a Little Piece,"" his tributes to fellow Maconites James Brown and Richard Penniman. And even when he's got-ta got-ta got-ta do his shtick he's one of a kind.

A glorified demo, so the sound could be crisper, but Tom Trombley compensates by sending out a flat, tough beat as pure if not as magical as Charlie Watts himself. And the material is there: ""Out of Step"" and (in a less theoretical vein) ""Black Plastic Shoes"" might qualify as theme songs for a band given to voicing the discontents of fairly ordinary nonmetropolitan under-twenty-fives who don't want to buy into the system if they can help it.

Less bracing than the nonstop Let's Go!, with only a few tunes--the miniature (""Fistfight at the Beach"") even more than the metaphor (""Cruise to Nowhere"") or the final statement (""Sound of Breaking Down"")--that bite hard enough to break the skin. But on ""Pub Rockin'"" they cop to their roots' roots, and you have to be amazed at how good punk was for these guys. They're devoid of Ameriphilia--of Dr. Feelgood's raunchy role-playing or Ducks Deluxe's mud-bottom romanticism. And if they don't write with the panache of Nick Lowe, they sure get to the point faster than Sean Tyla.

Title boast to the contrary, Reed has a commercial knack--he knows how to distinguish himself from competing bluesmen, more gifted ones included. His specialty is novelty lyrics like the title boast, here augmented by ""Fast Food Annie"" and ""Don't Drive Drunk."" Reparations from Stevie Ray Vaughan don't hurt either.

FALSE,B+,Take These Blues and Shove 'Em,A.C. Reed & His Spark Plugs,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8268,"
The crudest blues album anybody's made on purpose since Hound Dog Taylor died allows this saxophone player to sing--about needing a day job. Unlike his sometime leader Albert Collins, Reed doesn't stand a chance of knocking you over with his chops, which he knows. Unlike his noncousin Jimmy (whose tunes and harp parts he's wont to lift), he's far from certain to win you over with his slurs, either. This he may not know. But his earthiness is down-and-dirty enough to ensure that he'll come close.
"
FALSE,B+,Lou Reed,Lou Reed,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2139,"
Hard to know what to make of this. Certainly it's less committed--less rhythmically monolithic and staunchly weird--than the Velvets. Not that Reed is shying away from rock and roll or the demimonde. But when I'm feeling contrary he sounds not just ""decadent"" but jaded, fagged out. On the other hand, he dabbles with the best of them. ""Wild Child"" has the offhand, reportorial feel of a Bob Dylan dream, ""Walk It and Talk It"" is a ""2120 South Michigan Avenue"" based on ""Brown Sugar,"" and in ""I Can't Stand It"" lean post-gospel harmonies and a Stonesish bass line fill out that headlong mechanical ""Here She Comes Now"" rush. Question: what are the guys from Yes doing on this record? I mean, talk about staunchly weird. Or are we just talking about art-rock?
"
FALSE,B+,Sally Can't Dance,Lou Reed,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2142,"
Lou sure is adept at figuring out new ways to shit on people. I mean, what else are we to make of this grotesque hodgepodge of soul horns, flash guitar, deadpan songspeech, and indifferent rhymes? I don't know, and Lou probably doesn't either--even as he shits on us he can't staunch his own cleverness. So the hodgepodge produces juxtapositions that are funny and interesting, the title tune is as deadly accurate as it is mean-spirited, and ""Billy"" is simply moving, indifferent rhymes and all.
"
FALSE,B+,Coney Island Baby,Lou Reed,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2145,"
At first it's gratifying to ascertain that he's trying harder, but very soon that old cheapjack ennui begins to poke through. Oddly, though, most of the cheap stuff is near the surface--the songs sound warmer when you listen close. And not even in his most lyrical moments with the Velvets has he let his soft side show as nakedly as it does on the title cut.
"
FALSE,B+,Street Hassle,Lou Reed,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2147,"
I know Lou worked his ass off on this one, but he worked his ass off on Berlin, too--like so many of his contemporaries, maybe he's better off not aiming for masterpieces. The title sequence honors Eros as much as Thanatos, a heartening development, and I'm a belated convert to ""I Wanna Be Black,"" which treats racism as a stupid joke and gets away with it. But the production is muddled and the self-consciousness self-serving.
"
FALSE,B+,The Bells,Lou Reed,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2148,"
Lou is as sarcastic as ever--the lead cut is called ""Stupid Man,"" and in a typically acid rhyme he links ""capricious"" and ""death wish."" But due in part to the music's jazzy edge and warmly traditional rock and roll base (special thanks to Marty Fogel on saxophone) he also sounds . . . well-rounded, more than on Street Hassle. The jokes seem generous, the bitterness empathetic, the pain out front, the tenderness more than a fleeting mood. And the cuts that don't work--there are at least three or four--seem like thoughtful experiments, or simple failures, rather than throwaways. I haven't found him so likable since The Velvet Underground.
"
FALSE,B+,Live in Italy,Lou Reed,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8270,"
Unlike 1969 Velvet Underground Live, this isn't a song album, which is no surprise--a guitar album is what I was hoping for. But unlike Rock n Roll Animal it isn't a showoff showcase, either--it's a guitar ensemble album, which is subtler than I was hoping for. Reed and Robert Quine get their moments, but the matter at hand is the interaction of a crack rock and roll band. One of the things that makes Quine a great guitarist is his formal tact, and just as Fernando Saunders's bass defines Reed's recent music on record, the modulated anarchy of Quine's acerbic fills and background commentary defines the live stuff. Even so, I wish they'd arrived at a way for him to cut loose more within the structure, especially since Lou doesn't seem deeply interested in the well-worn classics that dominate the show. The function of crack rock and roll bands, after all, is to set songs.
"
FALSE,B+,City Lights,Lou Reed,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8271,"
His second Arista mix-and-match is said to unveil Lou the evolving romantic, though the voice is more compassionate than the songs it sings. The theme is ""Gimmie Some Good Times,"" much more at home here than on the aimless Rock and Roll Heart. Who ever said a romantic couldn't crack jokes whilst baring his heart--his lust and anger casual, his passion no more deeply felt than his cool? Reinforcing the impression: all the sides you need of Take No Prisoners--one.

FALSE,B+,The Raven,Lou Reed,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11883,"
Only a Lou-lou could love this concept album with a hole in the middle, by which I mean the theater piece that supposedly held all the new songs, old songs, new instrumentals, poetry readings, and cameo turns together. But though it's less than the sum of its parts, the parts are pretty arresting--Antony's castrato version of ""Perfect Day,"" for instance, is a terrible idea in theory that ends up beating the original. Gee, maybe Poe actually was the progenitor of Selby and Burroughs and, more importantly, Reed himself, who delivers the theme-setting ""Edgar Allan Poe"" with a rhythmic intensity that is, let's be frank, a rare thing in literary criticism. Best Performance in a Supporting Role: Steve Buscemi as a somewhat younger Lou Reed doing a lounge act the older Reed wrote.

I get shy when I write about putatively avant-garde composers like Reich--who am I to judge their compositional acuity? Somebody who knows great kitsch when he hears it, that's who. Music for 18 Musicians is damn near transcendent kitsch--what seems suspiciously lightweight at first reveals itself over countless hearings as durably ethereal. In contrast, these pieces sound dinky over the long haul--listenably dinky, but dinky. My favorite is ""Violin Phase,"" written for a solitary instrument back in 1967, before Reich got unpretentious.

Grown even more universal (and likable) in posttechno retrospect, Reich's mathematically ebbing-and-surging facsimile of eternal return is the great classic of minimalist trance, at once prettier and more austere than any Terry Riley or Philip Glass. Eleven minutes longer than in the ECM original ""owing to a tempo change governed by the breathing pattern of the clarinetist,"" this relaxed rerecording will appeal to graduates of the chillout room. But though rock and rollers can go with its flow, it's not a true reinterpretation like Bang on a Can's Eno, and I prefer the intensities I learned to love. Maybe Beethoven can be rehashed forever (and maybe not). With Reich, one is all any nonprofessional needs.

FALSE,B+,Rhythmatism,Steve Reid,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11323,"
Here's what happens when you oblige jazz artists to record themselves. The music is terrific; personally, I prefer this sampling from the forceful alto saxophonist Arthur Blythe to David Murray's work on Low Class Conspiracy, probably because it's simpler. Leader Reid, a drummer, always provides what the title promises, and like so many of the new players Blythe isn't limited to modern methods by his modernism--he favors fluent, straight-ahead Coltrane modalities, but also demonstrates why he belongs on a tune for Cannonball. But the sound is really lame--the drums are mixed up front without any gain in clarity or presence, and the horns could be coming through the bathroom door. A label like Blue Note, say, hasn't first-released any music this solid in years; I wonder how much just one album a year of it would cost.

FALSE,B+,Reckoning,R.E.M.,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2916,"
This charming band makes honestly reassuring music--those guitar chords ring out with a confidence in the underlying beauty of the world that's all but disappeared among rock-and-rollers who know what else is happening. As befits good Southerners, their sense of necessity resides in their drummer, which is why the Byrds analogies don't wash (who ever noticed Michael Clarke?) and why they shouldn't get carried away with the country moves (slow ones really are supposed to have words).
"
FALSE,B+,Fables of the Reconstruction,R.E.M.,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2917,"
If you had any doubts, new producer Joe Boyd clinches it: their formal frame of reference is folk-rock, nothing less, and nothing more. Because they're Southerners, they've always defeated folk-rock's crippling stasis: they have a good beat, and you can boogie to them. But as formalists they valorize the past by definition, and if their latest title means anything it's that they're slipping inexorably into the vague comforts of regret, mythos, and nostalgia. Trading energy for ever richer textures, their impressionism sacrifices its paradoxical edginess: it's doleful, slower, solidly grounded but harder to boogie to nevertheless.
"
FALSE,B+,Lifes Rich Pageant,R.E.M.,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2918,"
Musically, this talented minor band's fastest-breaking album represents no significant departure from the past, though just how many recapitulations of their lyricism one needs is clearly beginning to trouble those who took it too seriously in the first place. The players still make them and the singer-lyricist still refuses to define them, and while his projection has improved, it's hardly crystalline and wouldn't tell you anything you didn't know if it was. I mean, this is music for mushheads, and that it retains an undeniable if rather abstract charm only proves that there's a little mushhead in all of us. I give album four the nod over number three for its compelling snare sound and dynamic cover version. And insist that any normal person can make do with number one, when all this was a tad more spontaneous.

The ""air"" side combines the bite of their realest rock and roll with the shameless beauty their cult once lived for--it's funny and/or serious and/or rousing and/or elegiac right up to ""The Wrong Child,"" a title that speaks for itself and heralds the shit to follow. Which they dub the ""metal"" side, with heavy tempos and dubious poetry that make good on their intermittent moments only during the funny, serious, elegiac ""I Remember California.""

If the medieval dance tunes and Bach sarabandes on last year's Lady and the Unicorn were neither rock and roll nor my cup of tea, the same goes for these Child ballads and folkie blues. But anybody who can induce me to listen to something called ""Willy o' Winsbury"" all the way through is no ordinary folkie. I know because his mates in the Pentangle just tried it on Solomon's Seal. Which reminds me that Renbourn at his best is supple and modest--and bluesy--enough to remind me of the Pentangle at their best.

FALSE,B+,Street Called Desire,Ren����,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8277,"
Their youth and street aura are as much Peaches &amp; Herb as Womack &amp; Womack or Ashford &amp; simpson, but maturity is what they're after--the determined bliss and hot friction of a union beset like most unions by temptations, intrusions, distractions, and the need to eat. Though they sing better than they write, they also sing better than the competition, and as it happens this is the strongest set of songs in the tradition since W&amp;W's Love Wars--nothing classic or groundbreaking, but sometimes the truest hearts aren't legendary ones.

Thrashing their guitars or shambling like bumpkins or reading the personals w/musical accompaniment, this young band has a loose, freewheeling craziness that remains miraculously unaffected after three records. They'll try anything--there's even synthesizer percussion on one cut. If the rock and roll spirit is your bottom line, you'll love 'em. But because they play it so loose they do gravitate toward sloppy noise, which means that too often they're more conceptual than a loose, freewheeling rock and roll band ought to be.

FALSE,B+,Don't Tell a Soul,The Replacements,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3823,"
Circa Let It Be, Bob Stinson's guitar was a loud, unkempt match for Paul Westerberg's vocal, only he'd juice the notes with a little something extra and probably wrong, defining a band whose idea of inspiration was crashing into a snowbank and coming out with a six-pack. Especially on side two, the basic guitar move here is much classier: new guy Slim Dunlap plays hooks. On ""Back to Back"" Westerberg sings ""Back to back"" and Dunlap doubles a four-note cadence, on ""Achin' to Be"" Westerberg sings ""She's achin' . . ."" and Dunlap chimes in two-one two-three--like that. They aren't always so simplistic, but a decade-plus after the dawning of power pop the device reeks of the mechanical--except in country music, where formula is part of the charm, it's tough to bring off without sounding corny or manipulative. At its worst--I vote for ""Achin' to Be,"" which starts off ""She's kinda like an artist"" and never once slaps itself upside the head--Don't Tell a Soul is both. At its best--the Who homage ""I Won't"" (""I w-w-w-w-w-won't""), the Tommy Stinson anthem ""Anywhere's Better Than Here,"" or even ""I'll Be You,"" with Dunlap reaching bell-like through serious clamor--it sounds like old times.

""I Do My Swingin' at Home,"" Billy Sherrill has him say, but what makes Charlie special is that he also swings in the studio. That's one reason this doesn't sound like a formula country album. Another is that after ""Nice 'n' Easy"" he and his wife take over the songwriting on side one. Best: ""Memphis and Arkansas Bridge,"" about getting lost in the big city.

FALSE,B+,Talk Is Cheap,Keith Richards,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5944,"
State-of-the-art rock and roll traditionalism. Steve Jordan and Ivan Neville aren't just schooled in the verities, they're cocky enough to teach the verities new tricks, and the songs really do have a near-classic, half-remembered feel. It isn't just the late date that prevents them from going that extra mile, though--it's that Keith is singing, and Keith wrote the words. He's the soul of the Stones, fine. But as the Stones defined it, neotraditionalism takes concept, and no matter how fucked Mick is, concept would seem to be his department.

FALSE,B+,Can't Slow Down,Lionel Richie,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8283,"
Given Richie's well-established appeal to white people, this surprisingly solid album bids fair to turn into a mini-Thriller, and good for him--it's a real advance. In the years since he became a ballad writer he's learned how to sing them--""Hello"" is nowhere near as magical a song as ""Easy,"" but the grain of Richie's delivery gives you something to sink your ears into. And where the Commodores' funk often sounded a little forced, his jumpy international dance-pop comes to him naturally even when he's putting on that stupid West Indian accent.

FALSE,B+,Dancing on the Ceiling,Lionel Richie,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8284,"
Though it's customary to situate Richie square in the middle of the pop mainstream, in fact he's more austere than that, and more distinctive--his placidity and simplicity yield a lulling, almost mantralike entertainment that recalls Sade or J.J. Cale. Granted, his clich������������������d verse""Ballerina Girl"" is all too noticeable. And sometimes he doesn't put his heart into the semi-fast ones. But he compensates with a knack for tune that puts him over the fine line between lulling and boring--a knack that Sade or Cale would go metal for.

Well then, is this Lou Reed without chemicals or Loudon Wainwright III with a cold? If the former, he'd better renegotiate his right to be fey by balancing off each new LP with some rock 'n' roll drone (""Road Runner,"" say, or the Earth Quake cuts on Beserkley Chartbusters). And if the latter, there'd better be one funny song as astonishing as ""Pablo Picasso"" (or ""Rufus Is a Tit Man"") every time.

FALSE,B+,Rock & Roll With the Modern Lovers,Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7636,"
This all-acoustic record is even further in general tough-mindedness from Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers than that fey testament was from The Modern Lovers; it defines the difference between a child who is cute and a child who knows adults think children are cute. Sometimes I think I should hate it. But in fact I don't, because its self-indulgence represents not the manipulative arrogance of a star but rather the craziness of an almost powerless case of arrested development, and you can hear that. However unattractive a child Richman may be, he does convey the fragile lyricism only children are capable of.

In Australia she's been dubbed ""queen of jazz,"" which says more about Australia than it does about jazz. As does she--what's most appealing on this U.S. compilation is topical (and usually humorous) material about her native continent that's recommended to Nick Cave and Olivia Newton-John. But though she musters an impressively gruff blues timbre and on occasion some rudimentary swing, I'm not convinced she always goes flat on purpose, and when she emotes she may strain the credulity even of those who set their standards by Nick Cave and Olivia Newton-John.

Blues devotees wonder why Robinson, originator of what is now regarded as Boz Scaggs's classic and clearly a blues musician of courage, imagination, and skill, remains unknown off the circuit. Let me suggest some reasons: 1) He's so smart he gets a lot of mileage out of his voice, but the voice itself lacks power as an instrument and a dramatic vehicle. 2) His songs are well-written but hardly catchy; the closest this comes to a hook is the chordal ascent on ""Gotta Wake Up."" 3) His formal extensions are stylish and thoughtful, but he rarely lets loose and just has a good time.

Smokey has a right to the romanticism that has saturated his solo career--ick with kick has always been his specialty--but I get more from the Big Time soundtrack than from Smokey's Family Robinson. And then there's this, in which various Motown hacks attempt to approximate the bright, direct style of a less mature Smokey and come up with four songs (two of which begin each four-cut side) that actually do so. Whereupon Smokey, pro that he is, sings them as if he wrote them himself.

The tardy top-forty success of ""Crusin'""--plus maybe, who knows, an evocative title ������������������ la A Quiet Storm--has created the impression that the follow-up album's the comeback, but commercially and artistically that was last year's Where There's Smoke . . .

Aspiring popsters should welcome this proof that our greatest living poet is able to make do (and then some) with sneaky-fast melodies and rhythms and a vocal style of irreproachably guileless sophistication. Lets them off the, er, hook. Wordwise, that is. Not melodywise, rhythmwise, or voicewise.

FALSE,B+,Touch the Sky,Smokey Robinson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8295,"
Since his turn-of-the-decade renaissance, Smokey's been slipping back among the marginalia, where qualitative distinctions (better than Yes It's You Lady but not Being With You) get fine if not strictly personal. This one's recommended especially to cheating-song fans--""Gimme What You Want"" is defiant enough for Millie Jackson, ""All My Life's a Lie"" defeated enough for George Jones--though I'll admit that what pushed me over the line was the way the positivity of the title cut fades out on a pleading ""touch it, touch it"" that I'd swear aims lower than the sky.

The one about how much he wants to get next to a young thing who's been almost family since she was a baby is as convincing as ""Shop Around."" But with Smokey convincing doesn't necessarily have anything to do with factual. Which is the only reason ""And I Don't Love You"" (who else would begin a song ""The whippoorwill--whippoor won't""?), ""Gone Forever,"" and the agonizing ""I Can't Find"" don't have me worried (much) about him and Claudette. Sure there's filler, some of it written by Essar himself--he would try and get away with ""Close Encounters of the First Kind"" in 1984. But one thing you can say about Smokey's filler that you can't say about anybody else's--Smokey's singing it.

At first this seems disgracefully skimpy--six romantic ballads totalling 27:36, including a slow ""My Cherie Amour,"" a cover of Herb Alpert's vocal debut, and one count-it one (old Mary Wells) tune by Smokey himself, for title and ""concept."" Then you notice a gliss, a chuckle, a soulful paragraph or two, and realize that he's singing even more exquisitely than usual. Then, if you're me, you get annoyed at the Mo-on-the-town arrangements, with their full string sections and muted trumpets. And then, if you're me, you find yourself transformed by the urge to act as nice as Smokey himself.

Twelve songs, just like the old days, every one sweet and smooth and tinged with pain. And just like in the old days barely half of them are as vivid (musically or verbally) as hits like ""The Tears of a Clown"" or ""I Don't Blame You at All.""

If this live-double souvenir of Smokey's farewell tour with his group were the only Miracles record I owned I'd play it a lot. It totals less than an hour including patter and offers little that's new, but the show band gets through all the oldies with a minimum of extraneous swing and only on ""Shop Around"" does Smokey betray the kind of embarrassment that so frequently afflicts upwardly mobile performers reprising their teen hits. Good for him--he knows these are great songs, and he sings his ass off.

With its saxophone parts and enriched vocals, this reaffirms Robinson's affinities with cabaret after two albums of straight rock and roll and two inspired compromises with postmodernism. ""War Baby"" is a wrenching triumph and ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"" a great moment in gay liberation, but though it's nice that he sings ""Looking for a Bonfire"" and ""Listen to the Radio"" more affectingly than he did on North by Northwest, I'd rather he'd written more affectingly.

Positioned at four and six, the Max Martin-aided ""Show Me Love"" and ""Do You Know (What It Takes)"" are key, but without Robyn and her boys' ""Bumpy Ride,"" ""You've Got That Somethin',"" and ""The Last Time"" at one, three, and five you wouldn't listen twice. Then, a few spins in, you notice a hint of velvet in her timbre--more like suede, really--that suggests not sensuality but emotional depth. Which in turn makes the orchestrated popsongs about romantic responsibility sound thoughtful rather than mawkish. Too bad she'll turn 21 like every other teen idol.

Comprising six recent full-length dance tracks by the bandleader whose clarion baritone has made him the biggest singer in Zaire for twenty-five years, this is a well-designed compilation documenting Africa's dominant pop style. Most of the cuts have real tunes, with French lyrics accessible to a wide range of high school graduates, and two feature his female protegee M'bilia Bel.

""Love Radiates Around"" has a once-in-a-lifetime melody and was written by a pal of theirs, but its blissful sentiments don't suit this depressing compromise of a ""rock"" record any better than it would one of their Robert Fripp jobs. Even turning out songs on deadline they're sardonic weirdos, and though the material could be stronger, the monkey wrench is the received irrelevancy of the synthbeats and guitar solos furnished by three strangely indistinguishable production teams.

What's most distinct about the best jangle-pop band to surface in years is also what's weakest--the way the jangle-pop commonplaces ""sparkling,"" ""effervescent,"" and ""boisterous"" that adorn their raves don't actually apply. ""Addictive,"" yes, which is why admirers rave and why I'm giving them their due. Lyrically, the mood is basically melancholy, which in songs like the mournful ""Bellarine,"" the reminiscent ""Cappuccino City,"" the pro-immigrant ""Mainland,"" and my favorite, the love-out-of-reach ""Talking Straight"" are dark notes I'm inclined to suspect their stauncher fans don't feel, because that would dull their jangle-fix. FYI, the Hope Downs of the title is an iron reserve in Western Australia, but those words do have other resonances, don't they? Sub Pop connects them to ""the feeling of 'standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold onto.'"" The persistence of jangle-pop, for instance.

Back in '67 men were men and rock groups were rock groups: the Beatles ""long-awaited"" Sgt. Pepper appeared only nine months after Revolver and was followed by Christmas's Magical Mystery Tour, and the Stones released three albums. I don't propose to determine whether Between the Buttons and Flowers are A's or A pluses, but this one's a challenge--probably the most controversial LP they ever made, it features two communal jams of a most un-Stoneslike looseness, a (mock-?) psychedelic jacket, and a very subdued Mick Jagger. Really, Mick doesn't sing here, not expressively, he simply projects lead vocals through a filter which is one metaphorical equivalent for the sense of distance that is the album's obsession. A lot of people consider Satanic Majesties a, how you say it, bummer, but I'm fond of it; without a doubt it contains several great songs (""Citadel,"" ""2000 Man,"" ""2000 Light Years from Home,"" and Bill Wyman's ""In Another Land"").

Flowers it ain't, but Jamming With Edward it ain't either. The second side holds up better than the first, the sound and musicianship are rough and thin throughout, and most of the arrangements were obviously given up in the middle (remember One Plus One?), sometimes because the songs were worth giving up on. But Bill Wyman's ""Downtown Suzie"" and Oldham-Richards's ""I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys,"" to choose two previously unheard for all too obvious reasons, rank with all but the greatest Stones originals, and at its worst this still represents the world's greatest rock and roll band during the period when they were earning the title.

No one will ever mistake this for a great Stones album, but I bet it sounds more interesting than It's Only Rock 'n Roll should we take the time to compare and contrast in our respective retirement communities. The mid-'60s charm of such tossed-off tropes as ""Where the Boys Go"" and ""She's So Cold"" goes with music that's far more allusive and irregular and knowing: for better and worse its drive isn't so monolithic, and the bass comes front and center like Bill was James Jamerson.

Understandably, the material includes three meditative standards, and unsurprisingly, Rollins meditates up a storm at several speeds. The historical moment only intensifies his religious feelings about music; he's humble and masterful, questioning and joyous, swinging and polyrhythmic. Scott fits in, running changes with a satisfying physicality. But the heightened circumstances make clear that Anderson's main job in this band is to give the boss breathing room. And under the circumstances, there's too much of it.

FALSE,B+,War ina Babylon,Max Romeo,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7661,"
Romeo has long been a professional rude boy ina the Anglian outposts of Babylon, and this career training is reflected in the brightness of his reggae, refreshingly explicit and immediate (both musically and lyrically) in the wake of second-rate Toots and Marley. In fact, I find this album more attractive than all but two reggae LPs released stateside in 1976--the Mighty Diamonds and the first Burning Spear. But I won't argue with anyone who finds it tediously close in spirit to the foregone conclusions of Peter, Paul &amp; Mary.

FALSE,B+,Never Say Never,Romeo Void,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8310,"
This is no EP, it's a dance twelve-inch with three B sides nobody will remember. And nobody will remember anything about its reason for being except Debora Iyall lashing out with one ""I might like you better if we slept together"" after another. But that's not the reason they'll remember. They'll remember because of the beat, big drum doubling big guitar, and the sax breaks marking time. Which is quite enough.

FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Linda Ronstadt,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7668,"
Because it compiles work from both Capitol and Asylum, I anticipated an ideal sampler, especially when the first side induced me to enjoy ""Desperado,"" which she sings real purty. But the second side features her inferior versions of no less than three songs, suggesting that one might be better off obtaining her best music from its corporation of origin.

FALSE,B+,Simple Dreams,Linda Ronstadt,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7670,"
In which Andrew Gold goes off and Pursues His Solo Career, enabling Ronstadt to hire herself a rock and roll band. She's still too predictable--imagine how terse and eloquent ""Blue Bayou"" would seem if instead of turning up the volume midway through she just hit one high note at the end--but she's also a pop eclectic for our time, as comfortable with Mick Jagger as with Dolly Parton, interpreting Roy Orbison as easily as Buddy Holly. Even her portrayal of a junkie seeking succor from Warren Zevon's ""Carmelita"" isn't totally ridiculous. And I admit it--she looks great in a Dodger jacket.

FALSE,B+,A Retrospective,Linda Ronstadt,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7669,"
Safe (five cuts from Heart Like a Wheel, worth owning itself), genteel (six from Linda Ronstadt, her most conventional album for the label), and occasionally tasteless (""Hobo"" is pure artysong and ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" failed nostalgia), this is nevertheless a listenable compilation. ""Lovesick Blues"" and ""Rescue Me"" rock a lot better than ""Heat Wave,"" the Stone Poneys stuff surpasses that on Different Drum, Capitol's 1968 ""Silver Threads and Golden Needles"" sounds fresher than Asylum's 1973, and the genteel stuff does mix well, as they say.

FALSE,B+,Things Fall Apart,The Roots,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3848,"
Stop the violence in hip hop, but make an exception if these guys will shoot the piano player. Kamal gets away with his omnipresent ostinato beds here mostly because the band is looking back to the old-school rap they loved before they discovered jazz lite. They even sample now and then--I've never been so happy to run into Schoolly-D in my life. What's so consistently annoying on their earlier intelligent records is almost hooky on this one, integral to a flow that certainly does just that, which isn't to say you won't be relieved when it rocks the house instead. Gee--maybe they've gotten more intelligent.
"
FALSE,B+,Undun,The Roots,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15536,"
It speaks well for their strength of mind that Jimmy Fallon hasn't just been good for their economic viability--he's been good for their music. But superb though their 2008 and 2010 records were, and admirable though their equipoise has been, concept albums are such sinkholes that the partial success of this reverse-chronological tale of a doomed small-time hood is more surprising than its partial failure. Maybe I could work out plausible meanings for every song like some exegete brushing the cobwebs off ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands."" But all song cycles have holes in them, and really, just exactly what level of sagacity do we expect from Black Thought--or Bob Dylan, for that matter? What I get from Black Thought, as usual, is flashes of insight and articulated feeling. The sharpest verse here is Dice Raw's on ""One Time,"" which along with ""The Otherside"" is the closest the song cycle comes to a stand-alone song. So what I get from the album as a whole isn't a feel for the fictional Redford Stephens. It's the pop refrains, Euro orchestrations, and simplified drumming absorbed by a sound that shows no sign of standing pat.

"
FALSE,B+,Lady Sings the Blues,Diana Ross,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7677,"
Billie Holiday is uncoverable, possibly the greatest singer of the century, yet the fact is that Ross's versions--which occupy only two sides of this soundtrack album--are intensely listenable. That's the word I want, because it doesn't fit Holiday, who either seizes your full attention or disturbs you in the background. While copying Holiday's phrasing and intonation, Ross smoothes them out, making the content easier to take without destroying it altogether. This may be a desecration and a deception, but it speaks to the condition of a ghetto child who's always had a talent for not suffering, for willing herself up and through. Not every singer turns into a junkie, after all.

FALSE,B+,Diana Ross' Greatest Hits,Diana Ross,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7680,"
I'd hoped this would drag me kicking and giggling to rock and roll perdition, just like the old Motown best-ofs. Instead I found I had to learn to like it. Which I did, eventually--these are good pop tunes for the most part, and her ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" sounds more valid now than it did when Marvin &amp; Tammi were fresh in my ear. But rock and roll perdition is beside the point, because this isn't rock and roll.
"
FALSE,B+,Diana & Marvin,Diana Ross & Marvin Gaye,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7683,"
Motown's record division could really put out some terrific albums if the publishing division wasn't always butting in. Of the six Motown-composed tracks, only Ashford &amp; Simpson's ""Just Say, Just Say"" and the hit, ""My Mistake,"" have any charm of their own. But this girl-boy duo sound just great on two Bell-Creed songs and the follow-up single, Wilson Pickett's ""Don't Knock My Love."" And while I suspect it was Marvin who edged Diana into the warmest and loosest--and streetest--performance of her career, maybe it was just the proximity of ""Pledging My Love.""

FALSE,B+,Eat 'Em and Smile,David Lee Roth,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8316,"
With everybody from Patti to Belinda to Peter to Eldra kissing pop's ass, Roth gives it a pinch and keeps on trucking. Maybe because he lived out his wimpier fantasies on last year's EP, here he's free to mastermind his own piece of multiplatinum potential. Sure he covers ""That's Life,"" but he also assembles a metal band that'll cut old buddies: Maynard Ferguson drummer, cult heaven bassist, and on guitar former Zappa and Lydon sideman Steve Vai, who splits the difference between parody and virtuosity. I mean, Vai is funny without opening his mouth. And of course, so is our voluble auteur, who makes Miss Liberty a burlesque queen and neither lady a whore.
"
FALSE,B+,Too-Rye-Ay,Kevin Rowland and Dexys Midnight Runners,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8319,"
Rowland's arrangements are impossibly busy and his vocals impossibly mannered, but on this record he does the impossible--makes me believe he's found some young soul rebels. The unison horn voicings and post-Stax fiddles impart an underlying simplicity that'll pass for Celtic, and if Rowland swoops and swerves where a real soul singer would just emote, his earnestness prevails anyway.
"
FALSE,B+,Roxy Music,Roxy Music,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3023,"
From the drag queen on the cover to the fop finery in the centerfold to the polished deformity of the music on the record, this celebrates the kind of artifice that could come to seem as unhealthy as the sheen on a piece of rotten meat. Right now, though, it's decorated with enough weird hooks to earn an A for side one. Side two leans a little too heavily on the synthesizer (played by a balding, long-haired eunuch lookalike named Eno) without the saving grace of drums and bassline.
"
FALSE,B+,Stranded,Roxy Music,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3026,"
Any artist as oblique and ambitious as Bryan Ferry deserves an oblique, ambitious review, here provided (unintentionally) by Sidney Tillem in his ""Figurative Art 1969: Aspects and Prospects"": ""By moral in the context of art I mean a style which executes the deeper social and psychological function of form, as opposed to a particular aspect of vanity called taste. Pop sensibility, pop consciousness, pop sentimentality have been invaluable in clarifying the provincialism and nostalgia that actually permeate a culture that has come to pride itself on sophistication. But they have not resulted in a new art simply because the requisite idealism has been lacking.""
"
FALSE,B+,Country Life,Roxy Music,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3025,"
The Teutoni-textures of this music are proof negative of Bryan Ferry's deep-seated romanticism. But what happens when romanticism goes sour? And what is Phil Manzanera doing on that Nico record that closes with her version of ""Deutschland Uber Alles""? Oh well, I've always said good rock has to be dangerous. But when did I say it could be slow?

FALSE,B+,The High Road,Roxy Music,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3032,"
At 26:28, a generous live mini. Limber amplifications of the putatively impassioned ""Can't Let Go"" and the formerly unbearable ""My Only Love"" grace the A. ""Like a Hurricane"" and ""Jealous Guy"" redefine the parameters of rocksy retro on the B. Next time you want to hear Bryan croon or Phil wail, take a flier.

Borrows ""Do the Strand"" from For Your Pleasure (originally on Reprise, fellas) and ""Love Is the Drug"" from Siren and Greatest Hits, the better to showcase Roxy Music the creamy dance band. I wouldn't swear it's a better album than Manifesto, from which it appropriates four cuts. But I would swear it's a better album than Flesh + Blood, from which it also appropriates four cuts.

FALSE,B+,Omerta,Royal Crescent Mob,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8321,"
Although those who think all funk sounds the same might confuse them with, er, Cameo, unlike other umpteenth generation new-wavers they have identity to burn. Say they're '60s types hip enough to have learned their wacked-out anarchy from Pedro Bell's mid-'70s psychedelic cartoons. Partly because funk gets over on a groove more muscular than they can cut and partly because they put their all into a self-manufactured EP, only ""Get On the Bus,"" which also led the EP, and ""Mob's Revenge,"" for an ass-grabbing asshole and featuring a rousing ""You're fucked"" refrain, belong on their best-of. But their identity comes this close to carrying them over the top anyway.
"
FALSE,B+,"Something New, Old and Borrowed",Royal Crescent Mob,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8322,"
The borrowed is the largely legendary Land of Sugar, now available only as a Play It Again Sam import. The new is a Richard Gottehrer-produced single, half generic white funk, half sui generis garage pop. The old is five cuts ""live at the fair,"" though just exactly which fair is left unspecified. I smell a ringer right down to the wild cheers for the James Brown cover and the cries of ""You suck,"" though the Led Zep cover and the vamp-with-intro about corn dogs and heat-vs.-humidity certainly do the concept proud.

FALSE,B+,Rufusized,Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7689,"
Chaka's got a mostly new, mostly black band, and it makes a difference, especially in the in-house songwriting, with hooks courtesy guitarist Tony Maiden. The lyrics are worth catching, too, especially the answer to ""Rocket Man,"" in which the wife croons ""The universe is calling you"" without a hint of sarcasm. Guess that's what assuming the spiritual mannerisms of Stevie and Aretha--launching your voice into free fall, I mean--can bring you to.
"
FALSE,B+,Live--Stompin' at the Savoy,Rufus and Chaka Khan,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8326,"
Especially since ""Ain't Nobody,"" the killer hit her last album cried out for, comes courtesy of Rufus's main man Hawk Wolinski, this reunion is like a gift--for three sides live and one studio she's finally free of her freedom. It's not the '70s best-of a cynical admirer like myself might wish, but the material is stronger than anything she's compiled with Arif Mardin for sure, and ""Ain't That Peculiar"" is a complete natural. But beyond ""Ain't Nobody,"" Wolinski contributes nothing special songwise. Which I guess is one reason she wanted her freedom.
"
FALSE,B+,King of Rock,Run-D.M.C.,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3053,"
You can tell these guys are real rock-and-rollers because they sounded so much fresher before they got what they wanted, and you can tell they didn't get it all because their rhymes still make a lot of sense sometimes--especially ""You're Blind,"" a protest for and at the ghetto rather than about it. But their well-timed ""You Talk Too Much"" routine runs aground on stupid insults (""nagging wife,"" gosh) and old jokes (""Why don't you find a short pier/And take a long walk,"" groan). ""It's Not Funny"" is either a perverse albeit well-named joke or a complete washout. Even the boasts run thin. ""Take airplane flights/At huge heights""? I mean, what do sucker MC's do? Just taxi around the runway?
"
FALSE,B+,Tougher Than Leather,Run-D.M.C.,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3055,"
Coming off their sophomore jinx and out to prove their mastery, they ended up celebrating it as well; coming off their triumph and feeling too damn big for their minor label, they merely demonstrate it. Technically, the kings are nonpareils--not a duff beat or a forced rhyme. But for the moment they lack desire. I'll enjoy the genre-busting side-closers anywhere, the original-metal title tune and anticrime message on the radio, and the rest later.
"
FALSE,B+,Down With the King,Run-D.M.C.,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3057,"
A triumphant comeback, but the comeback is spiritual and the triumph formal, which adds up to art rather than culture. Where multiple producers usually signal overweening identity crisis, this is debt collection--since rap as we know it proceeded from their innovations and accommodations, there's no one in the music who doesn't owe them. And though the two Bomb Squad cuts owe Cypress Hill in turn, all the other guest overseers--Q-Tip, Jermaine Dupri, Pete Rock, EPMD--drop plenty flavor without impinging on the group's aural identity. Sure of their hard-not-gangsta ethos, equally deliberate in the vocals and the bass and drums, they always sound like Jay, Run, and Darryl Mac. Yet with their own spare production style signifying only as a trademark, they live off those outside shots, and the boasts about the stages they useta rip up ring truer than the ones about the trends they're gonna start. I hope their godfather status is good for sales as well as respect, influence as well as sales. But I wonder how much their return will mean, even to rap aesthetes, if it isn't.

I know it wouldn't be an authentic disco album without filler, but he's too blandly male a singer to put over pro forma romance. The exception is ""Supernatural,"" as you'll figure out if you match title to persona and consider the possibilities. And when he cops an attitude--on five cuts by my count, culminating in the deep-dish ""A Shade Shady""--he brings off a time-warped genderfuck all his own.

FALSE,B+,So Many Roads,Otis Rush,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7700,"
Rush has been the bluesfan's bluesman for years, but this album--recorded live in Hibiya Park, Tokyo, a/k/a Pepper's Lounge East--is the first time I've been able to hear why. Reason's simple--lots of room for his guitar. Rush is a ""good singer"" with a ""good instrument""--sweet, penetrating, slurred--but the words aren't where his soul goes. It goes into the form itself. Like B.B. King's, only less predictably by now, his solos expand upon the Chicago verities in almost jazzlike flights without ever transgressing against them.
"
FALSE,B+,Brenda Russell,Brenda Russell,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7702,"
If it's pop you crave, slow down a minute and check this out--eight love songs, all in sensual-to-pert medium tempos, all sweetly hooky. Russell's singing is breathy, soulish, and trickier than it seems, and though her lyrics are sometimes quite clumsy, they always sound felt and particular. Even the string arrangements avoid the vague and saccharine, especially those by David Wolfert, who produced Dusty Springfield's best album of the '70s. The material isn't as powerful, but this reminds me more than a little of Dusty's best album of the '60s, and that's high praise.

This is weirder than what you'd expect from a man whose Phil Spector savvy and slick gospel piano have helped stabilize both Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Joe Cocker. Russell has all of Mick Jagger's whine and shriek and none of his power, so while the singing is distinctive, and valid, it grates--impressive material from ""Dixie Lullaby"" and ""Shoot Out on the Plantation"" would simply be more so with other vocals. If not Delaney, Bonnie, or Joe, how about Marc Benno?

From ""Roll Away the Stone,"" more iconoclastic than Mott the Hoople's, to ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" more iconoclastic than Robert Heinlein's, the first side reminds you what an uncommon rock and roller he can be. But on side two, which yokes ""A Song for You,"" ""This Masquerade,"" and ""Hummingbird"" to three potboilers from Will o' the Wisp, you realize that his iconoclasm was (is?) as accidental as his standards.

Always defiantly thin both sonically and conceptually, M.I.A.'s best sidekick forever is an ideal conduit for a Bmore electro that doubles as the sound of ingrained urban poverty--a poverty complemented by a few throw-in anthems that use electronics to simulate affluence instead. Finally we've reached a tipping point resembling the riot grrrl moment of the early '90s, one in which every feisty hip-hop soprano has a you-go-illygirl edge on her notebook-toting male competitors. Selling point of the unfortunately download-only deluxe: two singsongy old M.I.A. collabs that drive the point home.

Instrumentally and vocally, these three Virginia over-40s are folkies. Ann Rabson's woogie piano and Gaye Adegbalola's unamplified guitar are high-generic only--their originality is in their feminist redefinition of blues-circuit raunch. Never again do they get as lewd or as fine as ""Middle Aged Blues Boogie,"" in which Adegbalola stakes her claim on that good young cock (and tongue) as if it was her right as a fully sexed human being, but there's a matter-of-fact candor to ""Fess Up When You Mess Up"" and ""School Teacher's Blues"" that's rare among younger guitar poets. And if Rabson has decided in her considerable wisdom never to take care of another man, only an MCP could blame her.

Look at it this way--if the Atlantic genius factory hadn't tried to transform this all-time ready-steady-go into a '70s folk hero, Mercury would never have hashed together these Quintet rejects. Apparently the potential singles were already used up--covers of Roy Sharpe's ""Linda Lu"" and Tom T. Hall's ""The Homecoming"" are the standouts. But every one is as unkempt and wonderful as the rest of Doug's Mercury stuff.

Saint Prix's chouval bwa rhythm is an uncle of zouk, much less high-tech even in this modernized version and a little light for my tastes--the leader counts the flute among his accomplishments, and rarely does his keyboardist rev up high enough to drown one out.

Jack Antonoff or no Jack Antonoff, pop-tailored synth sonics do not a pop album make, and artist avowals to the contrary, being personal requires more than the will to do so--it takes a certain kind of talent, one of the few Annie Clark may not possess. Big choruses you find yourself humming? But of course. Alluring lyrics that walk the tightrope of legibility? She passes that test. So there's not a track here that isn't manifestly memorable and intelligent. What's missing is the more amorphous and lowbrow aesthetic quality called accessibility. It's certainly possible to imagine fans in the hundreds of thousands aspiring to Clark's latest self-presentation. But the smaller number who identify with her are deluding themselves--she's a genius and they're not, and she's proud of it. So admiring every song though I do, I warm to precisely two: the one hooked to her ""I can't turn off what turns me on,"" an endangered principle or is it compulsion in this sociosexual moment, and the imploring ""please""s moaned by the putative top in the sadie-maisie cosplay tale ""Savior.""

Tugboat-like, his material chugs so steadily that I bet few under 35 will cotton to it, and he never tops a six-minute opener that chronicles the enduring love of a banker and a short-order cook.

More confident and hence more fun than Caravanserai, this proves that a communion of multipercussive rock and transcendentalist jazz can move the unenlightened--me, for instance. Good themes, good playing, good beat, and let us not forget good singing--Leon Thomas's muscular spirituality grounds each side so firmly that not even Flora Purim can send it out the window.

FALSE,B+,Moonflower,Santana,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7721,"
Mixing greatest oldies with lesser newcomers, salsa classics with rock covers, European concert hall with San Fran studio, this seamless double album should stand as the working definition of a world-class band. My objections stand, too--the improvisations sometimes divert when they should sustain, the groove is often too easy, and the vocal ensembles sound like commercials. But all these flaws, for better or worse, suit music of such global appeal. And Carlos Santana has never played so well for so long. In the rock guitar tradition he is less a man of style than of sound, a clear, loud, fluent sound that cleanses with the same motion no matter how often that motion is repeated--as long as the intensity and the context are there. On this album, the live cuts provide both.

Like Chuck Berry's, Santana's lexicon of licks has never guaranteed entertaining improvisation, and the square rhythms of his one-shot roots rock &amp; roll &amp; band (MG's and Thunderbirds converge on Muscle Shoals) flatter his guitar as aptly as any funkbeat. You'll still find solo atmospherics here, but at least this time they take after Booker T. rather than Sri C. And though the vocals go to damn near everybody but Carlos himself--Booker T., Kim Wilson, Carlos's dad, even Greg Walker, heretofore the finest singer ever to drop in on him--it's Willie Nelson who shows us what for, on a country tune that's the one cut on the album which completely transcends revivalism.

His renown as the man who brought black-tie New Year's to Bay Area haute bohemia seems a fitting climax to a career that's transformed Marin County languor into the hippest in pop cool. Listening back to his biggest tunes, the best of which (except for the mean, jaunty pimp-song ""Jojo"") seem to have been recorded in the mid-'70s, you can hear everything from old compatriot Sly Stone to more recent compatriot Elton John. But many of his ""hits,"" in case you didn't notice, were recorded right here in 1980, and so this collection includes three from Middle Man, one from Urban Cowboy, and one brand new fabrication. Silk Degrees isn't as tuneful. But when I want to remember how Marin County languor converted the masses, that's what I'll play.

Admirers of Red Crayola's Kangaroo?, the only album in history based on Marxist art criticism, will find this hauntingly familiar, not just in its often arcane leftism but in its apparent indifference to musical niceties like vocal pitch. Its pleasures are manifold, and its variety not of the obvious sort you might expect from four guys who play twenty-eight instruments. They combine awkwardness and grace, comedy and admonition, intellect and grunge in politically enlightened proportions. And borrow their pithiest lyric from Mao Tse-Tung.

My opposition to ""good"" voices is well-documented, and I admittedly find it impossible to hear the alternative I pine for in my mind's ear--something sweeter, softer, more murmured. (Paul Simon half an octave lower and cleansed of the cutes? Never mind.) But I know damn well I'd enjoy their pomo chamber-rock more if the singer could carry a tune. There--I said it and I'm glad.

From the beginning, rap has been a music of aggressive, expansive possibility, claiming the world on beat and boast alone. This Philadelphia street tough claims only his turf. His powerful scratch rhythms are as oppressive and constricted as his neighborhood, and his sullen slur conveys no more hope or humor than the hostile egotism of his raps themselves. I'm not saying he isn't realer than all the cheerful liars the biz has thrown back to the projects, or that his integrity doesn't pack a mean punch. But he's still an ignorant thug, and he's cheating both his audience and himself by choosing to remain that way.

FALSE,B+,Country Fiddle Band,Gunther Schuller,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7740,"
Why do I love this semiclassicized perversion when country fiddle and bluegrass music that strives for authenticity leaves me cold? It's all in the candor of the striving; as usual, I'm put off by the way so-called folk groups formalize a tradition that had spontaneity and unselfconsciousness at the root of its attraction. This silly symphony is something else. The melodies are fetchingly tried-and-true, the (unintentional?) stateliness of the rhythms appropriately nineteenth-century, and the instrumental overkill (twenty-four instruments massed on ""Flop-Eared Mule"") both gorgeous and hilarious. A grand novelty.

In the wake of willful hype and confused debut, this follow-up has been panned or ignored, an injustice. I'm impressed that four English guys could get the Byrds' kind of bittersweet, covertly strange c&amp;w so right, though actually it's not so different from what the Stones started doing with r&amp;b.

Great start: two songs in which gender spirals down the rabbit hole are followed by a Pink Floyd cover done Bee Gees-style. These star-time party boys never get brasher, funnier, or better, and their midtempo Elton isn't ironic enough.

Where American Honey is lascivious, the second album by this Houston rapper whose Lamborghini I've never understood is jutht plain thilly. Celebrating the women he fucks on the drugs and alcohol the real-life Travis supposedly eschews, the rapper-organizer taps a raft of people who owe him something, and if they're somewhat less august than DJ Khaled's band of toadies, they get more done as they establish Auto-Tune as the human side of screwed-and-chopped. Universal pitch correction makes it harder to tell one rapper from another even as big names Kendrick Lamar and Young Thug nail focus tracks. So let's hear it for 21 Savage and Kid Cudi too.

The ""hairy-armed women's liberationists"" of the title track are still with us, but at least this compilation avoids the fag-baiting that dishonored his first album, not the only sign of growth.

Never would have believed it, but the switch from Brian Jackson's supportive groove to Carl Cornwell's elliptical horn charts adds intellectual and historical weight to the songs that merely say good things as well as those that put them pungently. The two that constitute the latter category kick this off like the great album he's got in him.

""'B' Movie,"" his smartest political rap ever, is also his first airplay hit since ""Angel Dust,"" maybe because black radio cherishes no expectation of crossing over to Ray-Gun. Hooray. But no less than four cuts--the jazz and reggae tributes as well as the Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye covers--are diminished by the mere serviceability of Scott-Heron's post-Brian Jackson musical conception (execution?), because each invokes the power of music that only becomes truly powerful when it's more than serviceable. That's not to say each of them isn't of service, though.

This is what happened to Pharoah Sanders and I say yeah. The danceability of Jackson's music reifies the tribal aspirations of new-thing avant-gardism just as Scott-Heron's talent for modest analysis brings all that cosmic politicking down to earth. Also, I'm really getting to like Scott-Heron's singing--his instrument will never equal Leon Thomas's or Pharoah's, but that's not what it's about.

Scott-Heron stokes the protest-music flame more generously than any son of Woody, and in sheer agitprop terms ""Angel Dust,"" one of those black-radio hits that somehow never crossed over, is his triumph--haunting music of genuine political usefulness. Of course, it would be hard to imagine the Arista promo team busting its butt to get ""Third World Revolution"" on the air as a follow-up, even if it had a hook, but I'll settle for a tribulations-of-stardom song with an educational refrain: ""Do you really want to be in show bizness?""

Last year's Good and Gone import EP was too perfect for neogarage, too formally aware to get rough enough, but here (with two of the EP's best reprised) these pros seem like a different kind of tribute band--not Garageland Calling but London Sandinistas, strictly roots punks who can really play their axes. I don't mean ex-punks, either. They bury those roots except when they need a hook, and age has not withered nor custom staled their compulsion to snarl at the military-industrial complex and the girl next door.

Despite lyrics beholden to Mark Lanegan's attention-grabbing baritone, a big spooky aspiring commodity fetish that puts quantity before quality in the feeling department, these Northwest veterans have started roiling and hooking and knocking 'em dead at the very moment they seemed ready to expire of corporate torpor--not Kurt &amp; Co., but definitely good for a fix. It isn't just songs, which are in evidence on their SST best-of and discernible on their Epic product, and before you credit the production, which must help some, ask yourself why Don Fleming can't do the same for Gumball.

Seals will never be a Muddy Waters or B.B. King, and his fifth LP lacks the edge of Midnight Son or Live and Burning. But he's such an impassioned craftsman he makes the distinction problematic, and he doesn't stand still--this time he's singing tenderly enough to bring off the self-servingly sentimental ""I Can Count on My Blues."" Which I guess he can.

They sing, they rap, they sex it up; they honor Rob Base and Taana Gardner with subtle samples and proud savoir-faire. I say the murmured ""a mountain of spices in the arms of the desired"" could almost be Coleridge (all right, Rossetti). My wife says it sounds like Sidney Sheldon. And therein lies their charm.

The gears that never quite mesh in this disquieting but hardly apocalyptic industrial ambient may be metal and may be plastic but are probably both. Over steady drumming with a martial feel, they evoke two kinds of bum transmission, one automotive and the other an AM station breaking up on a late-night four-lane. Phones ring occasionally. Doors squeak. Pretty people murmur and croon. But that bird you hear chirping isn't--isn't chirping, isn't a bird. Think the part of a Tricky album that's no way funky. Stabilized by nary a foolish word, the unease is so unapocalyptic it's almost comforting.

FALSE,B+,Conversations With Kenny & The Legacy of Lee,Serengeti,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14713,"
There's one problem with this concept album: It's a genuine sequel, so that those who don't already know middle-aged white guy Kenny from Dennehy may have trouble relating to him as he descends into a 12-step funk. No such problem with his new acquaintance Lee, an African-American with entrepreneurial dreams of escaping his sanitation job by opening a laundromat. Sincere and clueless, Lee is defeated every which way, first by in-laws who turn Bubbles &amp; Fun into a crack bazaar, but even worse in the end by the sincere, clueless white bohemian chick he hooks up with. Whether sampled or electro, Tony Trimm's beats lend not just musical presence but groove and a few hooks to plotting more nuanced than any summary can suggest. Hip-hop is regularly extolled for its storytelling, and there are individual tracks that justify the hype. But Serengeti's understanding of character development substantially surpasses that of, to name a personal favorite, Ghostface Killah. Even with lesser beats, it would make him a rapper worth seeking out.

B) Ronnie Biggs singing ""Belsen Vos a Gassa"" is at least as entertaining as Johnny Rotten singing ""Belsen Was a Gas.""

Like her stepmother, Mauritanian iggawin queen Dimi Mint Abba, Seymali has one of those foghorn voices that wears you down after it's knocked you over. Complete lyrics probably wouldn't help that much, but not knowing every word hurts. So what kept this album in the play pile for me was less the singing than the band, which with Seymali playing a traditional females-only harp is anchored by another hereditary griot, her guitarist husband Jeiche Ould Chighaly. Justly, they regard theirstyle as a modernizing, genre-bending ""fusion."" In fact, the musician who stands out mans a trap set. His name is Matthew Tinari, he's from Pennsylvania, and he manages them. Good for him.

I prefer Go for It's soft-spoken groove, but the brilliant vocals and processed high-end percussion of their latest crossover move are an up.

This semipro is an accomplished musician and a better writer. Otherwise, couldn't no concept lift him out of the generic welter of New Orleans bluesmen plying their trade in an entertainment center with scanter historical claim on blues--as opposed to jazz, funk, rock and roll, and countless pianistic celebrations of the second line--than Memphis or Houston, Clarksdale or Chicago. But what distinguishes Shannon's songs about his love life and his work life, Oprah Winfrey and his right to sing the blues, is their context--taped conversations from the back of his cab with locals who've seen their pleasures ruined by the pleasure industry and out-of-town assholes who got their idea of revelry from old tit magazines. Makes one wonder how much joy can be left in a city fogged in by the rosy mirage of a tourist economy. And gives Mem Shannon the right to sing the blues.

By replacing the three heaviest losers on the English LP with three catchy little numbers, American Arista has come up with what might be the most interesting case of great-song-plus since Billy Swan's I Can Help. Shelley's voice is definitely harder to take wobbling around this discofied electropop than outshrieking the Buzzcocks' guitars, but the one-man groove suits his marginally solipsistic homophile romanticism quite neatly.

On a Milanese label distributed stateside by the good folk of Record People (66 Greene Street), this combines more of Shepp's chronic poetry-with-jazz with a nice boppish number on one side while the sax-solo-over-Latin-riff of your dreams flows over some 26 minutes on the other. Simple to execute, but I'm glad somebody bothered. It's danceable, too--but does it have disco potential?

Benga is a vaguer term than the notes suggest, indicating any modern Kenyan dance-pop, not just Luo but Kamsa or Luhya or Kikuyu, that moves the light and rather folkish Kenyan guitar sound toward the big-time West African competition as it explores tribal rhythms of more meaning to Kenyans than to us. Without their guitarist-leader, self-crowned ""King of Benga,"" Owino Misiani, Shirati Jazz recut some hits in London for this collection, a good thing in what is largely an ill-recorded singles music. They do sound light and rather folkish to me--delicate without juju's cosmopolitan intricacy, rhythmic without mbaqanga's urban drive. But in exotics, charm counts for plenty.

And you have to hand it to those Japanese--without much depth to account for, the audio ain't bad. And maybe you should hand it to Shocked too. She's got more vocal personality than is common among solo folk, her guitar accomps her wherever she goes, and though she may be a little long on folkie mythos (sleeping in the park, guys with tattoos, etc.), she has a reporter's eye and a tale-spinner's ear.

Personally, I'm sorry she chickened out of doing the cover in blackface, because it would have added yet another fucked-up twist to her impossibly confused attempt to sort out American music's racial debts. After all, her confusion is no more impossible than anybody else's, just further out there, and at least the opacity of her pontifications on minstrelsy illustrates how deep the mysteries run. As someone who knows a fair amount about minstrelsy, I'd point out that most of its tunes were written by whites, albeit whites who aped and/or stole from blacks, or anyway (speaking of confusion), claimed to--after 1860, 'twas oft complained that newer minstrels weren't faux-darkie enough. And as someone who'd like to know more, I wish Shocked had said damn the copyright lawyers and detailed the sources of all her new songs, which--except for the gnomic ""Arkansas Traveler"" on the up side and the preachy ""Strawberry Jam"" on the down--are at their best when they seem influenced but not imitated. ""Prodigal Daughter"" out of ""Cotton-Eyed Joe"" is a coup--hooray. But is there a sense in which the equally praiseworthy ""Come a Long Way"" is also a rewrite? Or did those notes just float in from the ether?

Fine bit-by-bit, with worthwhile bonus goodies (especially the four from the import-only Silhouette) and unexceptionable sequencing and selection, its generous length places an impossible burden on these quintessentially slight popsters, reducing them to the light background entertainment those with no tolerance for fragility thought they were to begin with.

She sings as a woman, a man, a who-can-tell; she rhymes ""broken"" with ""Yoakam"" and ""buck up"" with ""fuck up.""

Essentially a producer-composer rather than a performer, Sigerson pursues AORish rockcraft and studio-guaranteed aesthetic distance in the manner of such paradigmatic early-'70s ironists as Randy Newman and Fagen-Becker--but also, before you get your hopes too high, John Simon and Terry Melcher. His theme song is ""My True Feelings"" (""are whatever you think you see""); his themes are both hooky (musically) and kinky (verbally). At his best (""Over and Over""), he proves how life-affirming the hookily kinky can be; at his worst (""Danish Modern""), he proves how weak-minded irony can be.

Beneath a lusher surface, her voice enriched with overdubs and less idiosyncratically accented, Sill has become a real militant. Christ is a ""Soldier of the Heart,"" a ""Vigilante"": although ""the chosen are few"" we're supposed to ""see how His mercy shines,"" presumably because he saves any of us sinners at all. Last shall be first or not, this is pretty repulsive as ideology, yet until the kyrie eleisons at the climax I find it paradoxically seductive.

All I know about this predominantly black group is that its home town is Munich, in Germany, and that its current single, ""Fly, Robin, Fly,"" is currently, well, taking off. The style is very bare and pure, sort of minimal disco, with lyrics so simple-minded they couldn't have been devised by anyone who knows English as a native language.

Quite consciously--why do you think the new single is so equivocal about the phony hues Kodachrome lays on reality?--Simon sacrifices the manic-depressive range of his solo debut in search of an equivalent for S&amp;G's all-encompassing homiletic pleasantness. The vocals are softer, smoothed over with borrowed or double-tracked harmonies, and the pep shots from more specialized styles (by the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Onward Brass Band) less speedy. The lyrics celebrate domestic satisfactions and seem to find political ambiguities more curious than ominous. None of which is bad or dishonest--it suggests a new grace and flexibility for the mass-pop mode, and invests small subjects and emotions with an almost luminous wit and awareness. But I have my doubts about Kodachrome too.

I like Mick Hucknall enough to not want to mention that there are only two songs on this album--one by David Byrne, one by the Valentine Brothers, both of which he runs away with. And until the last two tracks--the finale is ""Picture Book"" itself, which wanders worst of all--he and his Brit soulsters carry it off on mood and groove alone, and with hardly a love song, either.

Exactly how deep you find his songs depends on whether you find Waylon Jennings more moving than George Jones or Willie Nelson and the extent of your attraction to psychedelic drugs and Tibetan or any other kind of Buddhism. ""Turtles All the Way Down"" is one of the great tripping songs. ""It Ain't All Flowers"" is trip-hop country. And when he says love is all that matters I believe he means it. But I didn't need him to tell me that. I'd just as soon he tell me about coal mining, or what must be an interesting marriage.

Hippies were rainbow extremists; punks are romantics of black-and-white. Hippies forced warmth; punks cultivate cool. Hippies kidded themselves about free love; punks pretend that s&amp;m is our condition. As symbols of protest, swastikas are no less fatuous than flowers. So it's not surprising that Siouxsie Sioux, punks' exemplary fan-turned-artist, should prove every bit as pretentious as model-turned-rocker Grace Slick or film-student manqu������������������ Jim Morrison.

Like Jim Morrison, greatest of the pop posers, Siouxsie Pseud disguises the banality of her exoticism with psychedelic gimmicks most profitably consumed at their hookiest, and voila. Although two of the four unavailable-on-album 45s on this compilation go nowhere, most of these nightmare vignettes are diverting placebos, of a piece even though they span three years of putative artistic development.

Having embraced Doug's sloppiness, do we now penalize him for getting it together? It's a shock to hear him make like a big-band singer, but on the two opening cuts (both self-composed and -produced) he sounds enough like a good one to remind me that Texas was famous for ""territory bands"" in the '40s. And while the Quintet-style side two is never quite inspired, it's never less than competent fun. Yeah, competent--the singing especially has the kind of force and definition he's always rendered irrelevant in the past. His old fans don't need this record. But those who've always found him ragged might just go for it.

The hallmark of Doug Sahm's warm, reliable, steady-rocking Tex-Mex is that it always sounds like you've heard it before--not the lyrics, which Doug just jotted down on some rolling papers five minutes ago, but the riffs. This can drive you crazy--""Nuevo Laredo"" is ""Mendocino,"" obviously, but where the hell does ""Revolutionary Ways"" come from? When the mood is right, though, it gives the music a kind of folkish inevitability that doesn't get boring because Tex-Mex is such a stew of influences. This is way too loose, and forget the slow ones, but what fun.

Prey to moralizing condescension like all self-appointed spokespersons for the downtrodden, Jamaica's female dub poets do enjoy one advantage over their brethren--they see through the male supremacism that suffuses the island's alternative culture as well as its official ideology. This former schoolmarm leads both sides of Heartbeat's 1986 Woman Talk anthology on conceptual reach alone, and here she gets to put her theatrical experience to work, impersonating both a big-talking petty criminal and a girl from the hills gone paranoid schizophrenic in NYC. The riddyms and the eco-African rhetoric could be deeper, but this is one propagandist who isn't afraid to admit how fucked up struggle can get.

The disco disc features identical versions (at 8:06 and 6:04) of the two side-openers--the title track, a magnificent, soul-shouting sisterhood anthem that could set straight cheerleaders and militant lesbians dancing side by side, and ""He's the Greatest Dancer,"" a seductive tribute to a fellow who gets to doff his designer clothes in the presence of countless panting women. (I wonder if I would have been so amused by the boy from New York City in 1965 if I'd known that in 1979 he'd be taken seriously.) All that's missing from the album is ""Lost in Music,"" that one-in-a-hundred I-love-you-know-what song that illuminates its subject. Plus a couple of useless slow ones and some chic riffs. So the d.d. would be your buy--if you could buy it.

Serengeti's ""Calm it down"" matches Sufjan's ""I won't be afraid."" But it's Geti's joking around that eases their shared mind.

Skaggs's taste and technique are impeccable; not one of these ten songs, many of them classics I'd never heard before, falters melodically or lyrically, and the arrangements, snazzy though they are, are so steeped in country tradition they could be from decades ago. Which I guess is my beef, because the only way you'd guess it isn't decades ago is from the faint folk-wimp whine in Skaggs's mountain tenor.

If Skaggs has come up with the best country album of the year, as he probably has, it's because despite his abandonment of bluegrass purism he's still a bluegrass purist at heart. Which means his commitment is more to the style than to the songs. Which means that above all his success is proof positive of the pusillanimity of the competition.

Nothing if not an astute traditionalist, Skaggs understands that what makes country music go is the tension between heaven and hell. But where most great country singers come off mealy-mouthed in the virtuous mode, Skaggs makes it sound as if he only sins because he knows he's supposed to. This may mean he's not a great country singer.

Technical brilliance and conceptual integrity put Skaggs on top of Nashville's neotraditionalist totem pole and make his albums run together like bluegrass. But this one has an edge. Maybe it's the moments of calculated grace--blues intro to ""Walkin' in Jerusalem,"" Everlys cover that could break them up all over again, duets with James Taylor and Sharon White. Or maybe it's just the drum sound.

Recorded live in 1983 on a two-track TEAC and God knows what else by a reconstituted bunch of originators, some of whom hadn't seen one another in a decade and wished it was longer, this forty-eight-minutes-a-side retrospective sounds better than the '60s studio rarities Top Deck compiled a few years ago and is a lot of fun to boot. We're talking party soundtrack for lazybones, the universal polka hop-and-shuffle of a thousand folk dances. Bump bottoms to ""Confucius,"" ""Fidel Castro,"" ""Lee Harvey Oswald.""

Fred Frith and Tom Cora's fractured songforms on ""Side Free"" make their seditious point more sharply than I'd feared, but I'm glad I had the sense to play ""Side Dirt"" first--I do prefer songs to song forms.

North Carolinan David Willis is a journeyman beatmaker-producer--big credit: no-big-deal Camp Lo--who's spent the major chunks of his two-decade career in New York. Recently he oversaw two official releases by Young Money second-stringer Curren$y, the kind of thug lite who's admired by Rick Ross's real-fake claque. Those who prefer those albums bemoan the loss here of two Mos Def raps I crashed my search engine seeking out. They're probably good--Mos Def has it all over mos of the nonentities who provide the vocal sounds on this beats-first showcase. Not Jean Grae, though--here's hoping Willis lures her out of her apartment. And note that the Mos Def songs in question, ""Cream of the Planet"" and ""Taxi,"" finish this off on the upswing as sayonora instrumentals. I listen to hip-hop for the rapping. But I've spent a lot of time dwelling on the music here, which combines beats per se with grandiosities like the dramatic intro to ""Nothing but Us,"" the guitar hook of ""Scaling the Building,"" and the full-on movie theme that carries ""Cream of the Planet.""

More or less the nonstop raver you'd expect, only friendlier, offering a much clearer sense of a performer relating to an audience than most concert LPs. Since I've never laid eyes on loud-man Noddy Holder, maybe it's just that I'm untrammeled by preconceptions, or maybe Holder's such a simpleton he's a cinch to suss, or maybe Holder's a genius. But most likely it's a little of all three. Surprise: the (sweet) pop of ""Darling Be Home Soon"" works better than the (automatic) overdrive of ""Born to Be Wild."" Second surprise: just before the final verse, someone approaches the microphone and delivers a very articulate belch.

This includes ""Gudbuy t' Jane"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now,"" the best cuts on Slayed? because it compiles the English hits of these Anglopop phenoms. I take it the reason ""Gudbuy"" and ""Crazee"" are the best cuts on Sladest as well is that these Anglopop phenoms turned into raving maniacs only recently. Clearly, it's what they were meant to be, and although Slayed? is less tuneful, I prefer it. You don't ask an air raid siren to play ""Stardust,"" or even ""Glad All Over.""

Proof that their now superceded farewell, 2007's The Woods, was actually a turning point: great punk band to great rock band. Half the tracks on a placeholder they've long since earned are from The Woods and 2015's No Cities to Love. Tempos are identical, arrangements unchanged; there's not a gift cover or a new song. But live and new, the old punk material does more than hold up--it changes, not exactly for the better but for the firmer. If Carrie is our Joey Ramone, Corin is our Mick Jagger. And you gotta love how Janet dominates the mix. She was always the genius musician here.

On their own label, with Eminem/Fiona Apple adjutant Mike Elizondo overseeing half the album, they shift focus to Alexis Krauss's teenpop roots--""I Can't Stand You Anymore"" has the killer chorus, ""I Can Only Stare"" the balladic gravitas, and both are Elizondo tracks. This is a healthy development with plenty of upside, but it works better in principle than in practice. Krauss may never master pop's heartfelt commitment to putative sincerity, and the one with the killer chorus is also one of the two where Elizondo claims composition as well as production credits. The sincerest is ""Baptism by Fire"" toward the end, where Krauss's ""I want to listen to your heart"" adds a welcome sweetness to the band's raging rhetorical parameters. Elizondo has a writing credit on that one too.

For once a white reggae style that rivals its models for weirdness and formal imagination. The choppy lyrics and playful, quavering, chantlike vocals are a tribute to reggae's inspired amateurism rather than a facsimile, and the spacey rhythms and recording techniques are exploited to solve the great problem of female rock bands, which is how to make yourself heard over all that noise. Arri Up's answer is to sing around it, which is lucky, because she'd be screeching for sure on top of the usual wall of chords. Some of this is thinner and more halting than it's meant to be, but I sure hope they keep it up.

A lot of folks just don't like Patti anymore, and so have taken to complaining about the pop melodicism (""AOR sellout"") and shamanistic religiosity (""pretentious phony"") she's always aspired toward. Me, I wish she'd forget she was such a bigshot, and I find ""Seven Ways of Going"" and ""Broken Flag"" as unlistenable as (and less interesting than) ""Radio Ethiopia."" But this is an often inspired album, quirkier than the more generally satisfying Easter--especially on the sexual mystery song ""Dancing Barefoot,"" quite possibly her greatest track ever, and, yes, the reading for the dead pope that she goes out on.

No, she hasn't regained her sense of humor, but aren't you fast losing yours? ""I'm no Sufi but I'll give it a whirl"" makes light enough of the mystic path her political obsessions follow.  And if sometimes her hymns vague out like ""Trespasses"" or over-generalize like ""Jubilee,"" the boho reminisce of ""In My Blakean Year"" represents where she's coming from, the sweet solemnity of ""Gandhi"" and ""Peaceable Kingdom"" sings the sacred, and the amateur-Arabist rant-and-release of ""Radio Baghdad"" speaks poetry to power.

A live version of a revered studio album is de trop. Packaging the two together, so that anyone likely to be interested has to buy a remastered original, is wretched--what Ralph Nader was put on earth to prevent, as both he and Smith tragically forgot. However. The live version is different and in no way worse. It's bigger and fuller yet not more pretentious--more passionate, maybe. Obviously but crucially, it's also older--she's Johnny's mother, consumed by empathy rather than ecstasy. In short, Horses is now a piece of repertoire, subject to two competing interpretations. I'm glad I own both.

Smither comes within a dud original and a few extraneous covers of bring it off, and they're all on side one. Overdisc the two originals are for real and the way he wraps his voice and fingers around ""Maybelline"" and ""Glory of Love"" makes them sound not brand new but old as truth.

After disliking their other albums instantly, I was confused enough by my instant attraction to table this one, especially since I had no stomach for the comparisons I knew an investigation would entail. And indeed, I still can't stand the others. But here Morrissey wears his wit on his sleeve, dishing the queen like Johnny Rotten never did and kissing off a day-job boss who's no Mr. Sellack. This makes it easier to go along on his moonier escapades, like when he reveals that looks and fame don't guarantee a good social life. Which gives you time to notice the tunes, the guitars, the backup munchkins.

Supposedly, Johnny Marr's unobtrusive virtuosity and subtle hooks saved Morrissey from drowning in his own self-involved wit, but on this U.S.-only retrospective of twenty-four previously uncollected songs I hear Marr and Morrissey gliding along on the crest of the same conversational cadence. Morrissey's nattering volubility can get annoying, but the cadence itself always has its charms, and just when you think you've had it he gets off a good line.

For a principled slacker like Snider, diffidence is an aesthetic principle, but here it tends to obscure some affecting little songs.

This woman's languorous, swaying folk-jazz fusion is striking enough to suggest that her debut LP will become some sort of cult item. And it's better than most cult items. But her groove does not quite carry cuts as protracted as ""It Must Be Sunday."" Nor is it an encouraging sign that the most commercial lyric on a verbally distinguished album, ""Poetry Man,"" is also the most fatuous.

Except for ""Mercy on Those,"" a quite remarkably tedious profession of self-righteousness that occupies the last 6:06 of side one, Snow's gifts as a singer and lyricist are finally channeled. The silly mystical ideas are way down below her overriding good sense; up above we find a fairly strong, direct, and happy woman who is by no means vegetating in her contentment, perhaps because she's too insecure ever to become complacent. She's rocking a lot more, correct practice for a content but uncomplacent person, and when her voice wavers it no longer sounds as though it wants to disappear altogether. And the three non-originals--""Teach Me Tonight,"" ""Don't Let Me Down,"" and ""Shakey Ground""--make quite a combo.

But punch a few buttons and you get a 10- or 12-track tribute to great divas male and female.

But Soriano's guitar is so nimble and articulate you forgive him his pleasantries, and on his second U.S. album his sisters add sweet and spicy accents to his beseeching vocals, which may deliver the Spanish lyrics but seldom leap any language barriers.

Of griot family, the seminal Senegambian salsero sang forcefully from the sternum and grooved unshakably from the fundament, a principled disciple-evangelist who recorded regularly with Orquesta Aragon in Paris and occasionally with his Manhattan heroes as well. In Dakar he was the dancing master of the postcolonial elite, steadying his bands' Congo-rooted ""Latin"" beats so that they signified for West Africans. In what I assume is completist grandeur on a two-CD set whose fran?ais-seulement notes are impeccably free of useful detail, these 26 ('70s?) ('80s?) (classic?)

Seldom, however, do they rise above, with the biggest exception the same ""Marie Gomis"" available in somewhat duller audio on the Sosseh album I've puzzled longest over, Monguito El Unico and Laba Sosseh. Three of the other four tracks on that record also repeat here, with the bonus that this ""Yamanekh"" adds a speedy and welcome three-minute coda. A titan, definitely, and near as I can tell--compared to Sar's easier-to-find Laba Sosseh, for instance--this is as good as you're liable to find until some saint does a proper comp.

FALSE,B+,While You Were Out,Soul Asylum,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8411,"
Dave Pirner's songs and Chris Osgood's sound do focus their barrage-band intensity, but once again the most striking track is a slow country-folk rip, this one cribbed more or less direct from ""On Top of Old Smokey."" Which isn't to put down Pirner's better-than-average tunes, but to suggest that barrage meanings may not be his calling.
"
FALSE,B+,Let Your Dim Light Shine,Soul Asylum,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3236,"
Welcome evidence that Dave Pirner may not be the Bob Seger of his generation--because where in the late '70s temptation came in the form of classic rock, in the mid-'90s it lies along pop's primrose path, a development that should offend only grunge nostalgiacs. The tunes of these neatly crafted songs are up top, their ""roots"" submerged the way roots usually are. And the often funny, sometimes fantastic lyrics are so smart you'd almost think Pirner knows how cheap he got away last time. After lingering over idioms like ""don't get my hopes up"" and ""left to my own devices,"" he moves on to vignettes in which his pervasive depression connects to something less collegiate than existential angst--the hard, sad lives of other people, several of them women seen not as objects of sex or romance, just struggling humans like him and me.

FALSE,B+,"To Syria, With Love",Omar Souleyman,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17211,"
In a way it's simple and in a way it's anything but. The simple part is that if you like rhythmically intense music that's spare and huge and human-scale all at once, you have to hear this intransigently masculine Syrian exile: call-and-response between his imploring baritone and oud lines adapted to baritone synth (over percussion aplenty, you bet). If you're impressed, as you will be, buy an album, why not? Moreover, you might as well start with this one, which has Diplo's label behind it the way 2013's Wenu Wenu had Kieran Hebden's. The not-simple part comes if you've already got your Souleyman album--Wenu Wenu itself, or the live Haflat Garbia, say. This one's more . . . I don't know, these differentiations are so marginal, focused or measured. Also, the Arabic lyrics you'll need a booklet to parse yearn on two occasions for his lost homeland rather than some metaphorical woman. But if you already own two of his albums, I doubt you need a third.

The vapidity of ""A happy face, a thumping bass, for a loving race"" wouldn't bother anybody if these Londoners didn't take dread in vain--with hair like that you're supposed to be more, you know, cultural. But for a disco band, they're quite all right, really--very tuneful, with a nice loping groove and vocals out of Chic and Eddy Grant. And though I wish they liked saxophones, the flute is them.

Anglophilia's favorite androids were destined from day of manufacture to meet up with some rock technocrat or other, so thank Ford it was Giorgio Moroder, the most playful of the breed. They even got a minor dance hit out of it--""Beat the Clock,"" a good one--but that's not the point. The point is channeling all their evil genius--well, evil talent, then--into magic tricks. Like the ultimate voice-box song. Or the title tune, which sounds like ""Baba O'Riley"" and then breaks down into Eno (or is that Gentle Giant?). Fun fun fun.

But she's sure put some benwa balls into a slut act only wankers took literally, and now the balls have beats. From ""Gimme More""'s ""It's Britney bitch"" hiya to ""Piece of Me""'s single-of-the-year sonics, from ""Ooh Ooh Baby""'s ""feel you deep inside"" to ""Perfect Lover""'s ""touch me there,"" this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked.

Moreover, it's possible the stupidity of the sex symbol up front is an illusion exploited by her legal guardians and maybe even the symbol herself. But it's such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy. She's just too straight-faced with the botched Bellamy Brothers joke, the nauseous ""Your body look so sick I think I got the flu,"" the abstemious ""Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,"" the concupiscent ""I'm a little selfish"" become the childish ""I'm a little sailfish.""

There's miraculous rhythmic progress from the polkafied chug-along of the Specials' ska to the suave Caribbean lilt here, which makes Jerry Dammers's most reclusive flights functional. But Dammers (together with mouthpiece Stan Campbell) never convinces me that the anomie he evokes so stubbornly has the public dimension that its proximity to ""Bright Lights,"" ""Racist Friend,"" and ""Free Nelson Mandela"" implies.

I don't often wonder what the world is coming to because someone can't get a record contract--after all, life is unfair--but here I'm tempted. A sharp, witty bar-band-blues LP like the first is one thing, but the mid-tempo stuff on this entry could fit in right next to Tom Petty and Bob Seger if only some hotshot producer would oil Robert Bobby's voice up a little. That's no advantage as far as I'm concerned, but uncommercial it ain't. What could be the problem? Surely not the antinuke overtones of ""Hearts Like Atoms Split."" Maybe somebody noticed the chorus of ""Anna"": ""Anna, anabolic steroid/Oh Anna, you made a man outta me.""

FALSE,B+,What We Saw From the Cheap Seats,Regina Spektor,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15729,"
Outside of country music (and I don't know who compares there), pop music is home to few friendlier artists than Regina Spektor. So well-meaning you want to kiss the tip of her nose, she uses her classical chops to craft tunes that will help any normal listener smile. But although a practical humanist is a rare thing, this one often needs more spice or even grit, and here her whimsy is front and center. I love ""All the Rowboats,"" about a museum--""Masterpieces serving maximum sentences/It's their own fault/For being timeless""--and ""Firewood,"" about a piano. ""Ballad of a Politician"" plays off ""Shake it, shake it baby"" (hands, get it?) and ""Open"" comes with a gurgling groan. But many of these songs are merely bemused, and when she revises ""I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,"" all she achieves is a different singalong from the one you expected.

You're a fan of the Spinners' first tenor, Felipe Wind (sp?), whose vocal improvisations, as free as Al Green's though in more of a jazz scat mode, play against the Spinners' disciplined harmonies in a virtuoso demonstration of the limits of slick.

The notes identify them as ""pioneers"" of ""topical lyrics that were realized by the production of the song,"" which makes me think again about the way the first two cuts, ""1984"" and ""Mechanical World,"" shift texture and tempo. By the stars, I do believe these fellows helped invent art-rock. This is not an unmixed distinction, but it could be worse: the topicality is a notch above ordinary rock sci-fi (they have a sense of humor), the derivations more jazz than classical. The big plus here though, is that great shining 2:39 of hard rock guitar, Randy California's ""I Got a Line on You.""

Avatars of a slightly slowed-down Belgian industrial-disco style (subculture?) that I suspect is called ""new beat"" because buyers will know what the phrase means anywhere in the EEC, they don't overdo the wimp and doom factors that ruin so much synth-based dance music--just play them for tune and discord respectively. A taste for sex and the occasional funny bit facilitate this achievement.

A few songs grab you, the rest grow on you, the lyric sheet makes some sense. Dynamics fill in for groove. But even after you run the hooks through your head for a day--""Take the fifth,"" ""fitted shirt,"" ""that you're next to me""--you don't have much idea what Britt Daniel is on about, except maybe that he wonders why he works so hard on his songs, and (duh) has yet to find true love. And beyond ""Take the fifth,"" no phrases stick out as free-floating signifiers, either. In short, the indie-pop conundrum in a nutshell too slippery to crack--unless you really like filberts.

Britt Daniel's voice is so unyieldingly masculine it could make you miss the soulful self-pity of a Gavin Rossdale. So what keeps me playing his long-delayed return to the majors is the sound effects. Hums and handclaps and whistling. Vibraphone gurgle and harp arpeggio and Fairlight fanfare. Drum rolls and digital clickety-clacks. Piano plinking, piano freaking, organ swells, keyb distorts. Guitar colors of every description--pseudo uke! fingering squelch! neck strum! There's a falsetto moment. There's a duet vocal. You too can be glued to your chair waiting for the next surprise like it's a hidden joke on a Fountains of Wayne album. Start with ""Knock Knock Knock,"" which is jammed with them. Or if you prefer, just light up and spend 40 minutes giggling when you least expect it.

Fledgling producer David Wolfert doesn't get her voice as subtly as Roy Thomas Baker (or Jerry Wexler) did, but he gives her more good songs than she's had in a decade.

I find it hard to be objective about the woman who in 1969 joined Jerry Wexler to make one of my favorite--hell, one of the greatest albums of all time: Dusty in Memphis, pop with strings on top, good old boys below, and the most exquisite material of a class act's career in between. Springfield's only rival was and is Dionne Warwick, but Warwick has Bacharach-David in her karass while Dust was stuck with Ivor Raymonde. This mid-60's hits compilation could be a lot better: it predates the definitive ""The Look of Love"" and bypasses inspired filler like ""Mama Said"" and ""Do Re Mi"" for the hideously orchestrated schlock she spent her biggest years transcending. Yet though she never belted like she crooned, she put so much heart, soul, and mind into her big ballads that most of the time you can ignore the kettle drums. I only wish I could hear what Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin--and Dusty--would have made of ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me.""

""The Angel"" and ""Mary Queen of Arkansas"" are turgid unaccompanied-acoustic horrors that could scare anybody off this particular Dylan hype. But the jokey lingo and absurdist energy of everything else are exactly the excesses that made Dylan a genius instead of a talent--it takes real conviction to save ""But did not heed my urgency"" with ""Your life was one long emergency."" Even urban-mythos rambles like ""Lost in the Flood"" are not without charm. And in songs like ""Growin' Up"" and ""Blinded by the Light"" there's an unguarded teen-underclass poetry that has Springsteen's name on it.

""Promised Land,"" ""Badlands,"" and ""Adam Raised a Cain"" are models of how an unsophisticated genre can illuminate a mature, full-bodied philosophical insight. Lyrically and vocally, they move from casual to incantatory modes with breathtaking subtlety, jolting ordinary details into meaning. But many of the other songs remain local-color pieces, and at least two--""Something in the Night"" and ""Streets of Fire""--are overwrought, soggy, all but unlistenable. An important minor artist or a rather flawed and inconsistent major one.

The title and no doubt the intermittently ""commercial"" sound are about band democracy, or maybe dictatorship of the proletariat--Stampfel gives up three lead vocals and five songs and gets the most uneven record of a career that's never confused consistency with virtue. The division is almost too neat--only one Stampfel loser, and also only one non-Stampfel winner, the John-Lee-Hooker ad absurdum ""Mindless Boogie,"" which together with Stampfel's democratically romantic ""Bridge and Tunnel Girls"" may actually earn the college-novelty rotation he's always deserved.

Staples's argument is, first, that the thug life was forced on him, not merely because he grew up on the wrong side of Long Beach but because his parents were gangbangers, and second, that white America is invested in the thug life, via not just the systemic racism that keeps African-Americans down but the systemic sensationalism of white hip-hop fans scarfing up gangsta horrorshow. As a white hip-hop fan who's resisted every thug coup d'art since the Wu-Tang Clan (who were major, I was wrong, but I hate guns and I hate sexism and I'd rather be wrong than tag along), I believe the sensationalism is more ironic than causal except perhaps insofar as gangsta swagger impresses boys in the hood who might otherwise settle for the crap jobs staying in school is good for. But give Staples credit--he doesn't swagger. He's always hard, often impassive, occasionally callous, but never brutal or mean, and nothing in his rhymes, flow, or beats boasts or romanticizes. What good that'll do who knows. But he's not part of any problem I can see. As thug coups d'art go, this takes Rick Ross to court, renders Freddie Gibbs more unnecessary than he already is, and is hella cooler than Iceberg Slim.

For no discernible reason--when last seen (on Broadway), they appeared ready to settle for Winnemucca if Vegas didn't call--this is their toughest and best Stax LP. Once again the prime virtue is consistency, but this time they add a few lumens to the average brightness of each performance. And though their social vision may be vague, at least they were political before it was commercial, which gives them an edge. Best cut: ""My Main Man,"" about Jesus.

Mike Piccirillo and Gary Goetzman, who brainstormed not only the Heads cover that brought the Staples back last year but also the bedroom-eyes embarrassment that was supposed to cement their chart status, here discover that the great pop subject of this reformed gospel group is public morality. And lead off with two covers--the first from, are you ready, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, topped by ""Life During Wartime""--so incandescent they lend a glow to the producer-penned protest sentiments that follow.

David Hinds has always signed his music by swinging the beat a little more than is normally advisable, and this time, subtly but tellingly, his jazzbo tendencies catch up with him. Where in the past he'd add a subliminal tension to the groove by extending syllables slightly, here his phrasing sometimes goes slack--at one point he even adds a ""now"" that would do Joe Piscopo proud to the line ""As long as Babylon is my foe."" So despite strong material, this lacks the requisite steely edge. And whether the confusion of ""laboratory"" with ""lavatory"" is simple ignorance or one of those deep Rasta puns, it sums up his wit and wisdom on ""these times of science and technology"" all too neatly.

After all, to a certain kind of reclusive aesthete, well-crafted West Coast studio jazz is as beautiful as anything else, right? Only I'm no recluse. I hated this record for quite a while before I realized that, unlike The Royal Scam, it was stretching me some; I still find the solo licks of Larry Carlton, Victor Feldman, et al. too fucking tasty, but at least in this context they mean something. I'm also grateful to find Fagen and Becker's collegiate cynicism in decline; not only is ""Deacon Blues"" one of their strongest songs ever, it's also one of their warmest. Now if only they'd rhymed ""I cried when I wrote this song"" with ""Sue me if I play it wrong,"" instead of ""Sue me if I play too long."" Prefering long to wrong could turn into their fatal flaw.

An excellent comeback from two bad albums, marred only by the lyrics. John Kay's lyrics have always been awkward and preachy, in a fairly endearing way, but he had the sense to keep them fuzzed behind, so that they had to be discovered.

Problem is the mere competence that afflicts so many well-meaning bands: it's versatile of them to generate as well as sample beats, but ""A.F.R.I.C.A."" went nowhere musically, and Wise's smart talk is buried in a ""Float On"" remake even ickier than the original. Album two gets across not on ace cuts like the revolutionary credo ""Freedom or Death"" (Professor Griff please copy) or the sampling credo ""Talking All That Jazz"" (James Brown please copy), but on a camaraderie that reaches deeper than the usual homeboy bonding. How much further it can go remains to be seen.

A landmark: the first rock record to use the word ""fuck"" (""fucking,"" actually) at the end of a line, an achievement typical of its occasional flaws--the rhyming word, ""plucking,"" is forced--and unrepresentative of its success. The eighteen-minute title cut is a decent, serious, and touching reminiscence of sexual growth that for all its male bias is recommended to songwriters reluctant to shed their adolescence. The other songs are well-observed despite their sentimental tendencies, and guest guitarist Jimmy Page proves that folk-rock is his metier.

Well past his moment at 32, he died on the road in 1970, leaving this, more or less: two doowop-derived soul-r&amp;b sob-song classics, trilled and scatted pull-out-the-stops demolitions of Doris Day's ""Secret Love"" and the Gershwins' ""Summertime,"" and other vehicles for his piercing tenor and sharp groove--notably ""Fat Boy,"" about an overweight lover who may be built for comfort but is also, for once, insecure. In short, a more distinguished body of minor music than can be claimed by many better-remembered later soul men who'll remain nameless here.

FALSE,B+,You're Not the Woman You Used to Be,Gary Stewart,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1345,"
In case it's not clear why rock and rollers are so excited about a new country singer, it's because he really sings rockabilly, which supposedly flourished for a few years in the mid-'50s and then vanished. What I like best about this compilation of flop singles from a few years ago is the way Stewart transforms rockabilly's adolescent phobias about wimmin into unabashed burlesques involving the likes of ""Big Bertha"" and ""The Snuff Queen.""

FALSE,B+,Battleground,Gary Stewart,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1351,"
As with so many country albums, one's faith fluctuates from listen to listen: the songwriting isn't always absolutely choice, at times the voice lurches back toward the gulps and hollers that swamped his attempted comeback, and his guilt sounds more emotionally whole than his rowdy ways, which is why he's always been a country singer with r&amp;r affinities rather than vice versa. But this is his best in 13 years (just lucky, I guess). His r&amp;r groove is sharp-witted where Steve Earle's is muscle-headed and the average Nashville cat's just mechanical. And whether he's pledging desperate devotion or spitting out the perfect pun-trope ""Seeing's believing/So I'll be leaving today,"" you know damn well it's his fault. Whatever it is.

After Smiler I was convinced that his talent had vanished; this makes it seem that he'll be breathing life into ten songs a year in perpetuity. The Southern session men he works with here suit his more generalized interpretive approach, on the ""slow side"" as well as the ""fast.""

FALSE,B+,The Best of Rod Stewart,Rod Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7891,"
As if to prove how arbitrary compilation albums from consistent album artists are, this omits four selections from Sing It Again Rod. The third side, which features both halves of a previously uncollected single and the previously unavailable-on-disc ""What Made Milwaukee Famous,"" has its uses. And the stuff from Smiler should never have come out in the first place.

Cut for cut this is Stewart's most consistent Warners album, and it does rescue three tracks from Foot Loose and Fancy Free. But its malfeasances are so annoying--there are already three (Mercury) albums that include the anachronistic ""Maggie May,"" and it would be nice to have the disco mix of ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" on an LP--that maybe you should seek out Atlantic Crossing. ""Tonight's the Night"" you know to death, right? But when's the last time you heard his ""Three Time Loser"" or ""This Old Heart of Mine""?

This group tests our male-timbre chauvinism--Ian Lloyd sounds disconcertingly like a goil. Too bad he voices the same old male sentiments--don't let me down, push me 'round, or complain when I leave at the dawning--because the music is special: dense, clean, kinetic, almost mid-Beatles in spirit, but contemporary. If only they'd written one lyric as breathtaking as most of Michael Brown's melodies or as strong and as flexible as Lloyd's voice turns out to be or as commercial-meaningful as their hit remake of Hot Chocolate's ""Brother Louie.""

This isn't so much hard country as quiet honky tonk, which I don't hold against Strait, a handsome and discerning fellow whose pleasant baritone, though not designed to swallow whole cans of corn (cf. John Anderson, Ricky Skaggs), boasts a subtle, built-in catch. But he's so unassuming I'm afraid he's destined to remain a minor pleasure--one more lonely tiller in fields left fallow by Billy Sherrill.

As an unreconstructed rock-and-roller, I prefer my country music out on the edge--if not zany or wild-ass then at least (and often as best: Jones, Frizzell, Wynette) deeply soulful. Despite his regard for the zany, wild-ass, and deeply soulful verities, what I get from Strait is a convincing show of honesty. And what I get from his best album and song selection to date is a convincing, tuneful show of honesty.

Timely details--cellphone cutouts and charging problems, TV sex tips. Eternal truths--he's sure she's done bad stuff, but in the heat of argument can't remember just when. Dodgy plotting--obscure bit with Simone's coat leads to sad ending with a twist. A hook marks each chapter--right, chapter. This makes engrossing listening if the effort suits you, but it's useless as background music--behind Alan Sillitoe, Roddy Doyle, Dick Hebdige, the box scores, anything.

FALSE,B+,Full Time Woman,Alice Stuart,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7919,"
Beautiful melodies and clean, countryish, somewhat static postfolk arrangements transform these lyrics into memorable statements of feeling and principle. A bit male-identified, I admit, but the salutory synthesis of small voice and independent spirit proves that a woman doesn't have to be macho to be autonomous. Now who'll prove it for men?

One reason Paul Weller's rock and roll never convinced non-Brits was his reedy voice, which he has no trouble bending to the needs of the fussy phonographic cabaret he undertook so quixotically and affectedly after retiring the Jam. I'm sure the move has cost him audience, but the new format suits the specifics of his socialism. A self-made Fabian rather than a would-be demagogue, he hopes to inspire militance with description and analysis. My Ever Changing Moods was so moody it flirted with incoherence, but here the politics are concealed on the surface of a fluent if not seamless Europop that goes down easy.

James Taylor is merely a wimp--Russell Thompkins, Jr. is a Wimp God. The creamy fluidity of his falsetto is miraculous, and the settings provided by composer-producer Thom Bell simply heavenly. Unfortunately, the material isn't as consistent on the group's second album in a year (three hits plus uneven filler) as on the first (five hits plus impressive filler).

Skinflints and formalists both, indie guys resist the digital bloat that sends most releases ballooning toward an hour, and I say good for them. The three otherwise unreleased tracks on this EP would have fit physically onto the new album but undercut it conceptually, and all the worse if few listeners would have noticed. More powerful than Beaster, less revealing than Copper Blue, this is Mould Inc. in ""dark"" mode. Fans will be content to pay extra for it. Admirers won't suffer if they pass it by.

They're as quirky as you thought they were, but no longer are their quirks strictly personal, which may help their disjointed musical effects impact on the rest of us. Bj������������������rk's Freudian fantasies are subsumed in a not unfantastic adult sexuality, and she shares more of the stage with Einar, who plays madness to her empathic concern even when she's abandoning him to the encroaching ice. The end of the world interests them now that they've got a place in it: they face or face down their doom with a humor and affection that's sometimes fatalistic but never passive. In short, they're beginning to sound like a band with at least as much future as the rest of"

In which schlocky Michael Omartian replaces magic man Quincy Jones and Summer is born again. You know why? Because Omartian believes in Jesus, that's why. The result is the best Christian rock this side of T-Bone Burnett, and not just because it's suitable for Danceteria, although that helps. After all, can T-Bone claim to have introduced the concept of agape to the secular audience?

FALSE,B+,Another Place and Time,Donna Summer,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6127,"
I tried to credit her comebacks, giving up only when that song about fucking Einstein cracked WBLS. But though Stock Aitken Waterman are no Einsteins, they're smart enough to know a voice when they hear one, which usually happens when they listen to other people's records--they've invented a pop machine that enables singers as adenoidal as the average British teenager to pass for Motown Mark XC after one or two treatments. Since Summer's great gift has always been her ability to emote inconsistent banalities as if her life depended on them, which after all those failed comebacks it kind of does, she lights into these retooled tunes with a phony enthusiasm that must have scared the shit out of Bananarama. Ever up, ever danceable, ever there, she's once again a believer, or rather ""believer."" And hidden over on the second side is a succinct new cliche about why women leave their men.

A/k/a Cornelius Green of Opelousas, Louisiana, Sundown came out of a decade's retirement to cut this modest but exemplary blues LP.

Mark Kozelek has always been one more alt-rock sad sack to me, and without much a beat at that, so I won't pretend there's any musical reason to listen to this wall-to-wall bummer. But where he's generally obsessed on an alt-rock melancholy about which most human beings could care less, here he explores something that happens to everyone: death in the family, mostly in working-class Ohio, where he grew up. There's his second cousin Carissa gone at 35 in a freak garbage fire, his uncle gone the same way long ago, his kindly grandma in L.A., and worst of all his dad's pseudonymous mercy-killing friend--who with his wife taken out of her misery turned the gun on himself only then ""failed at suicide"" and got sentenced to prison. All of which induces him to write ""I Love My Dad"" and ""I Can't Live Without My Mother's Love,"" and whether you're attracted to his songs or not you feel just how bad this depressive is gonna hurt when his long-separated parents go. That's musical enough for me.

For the most part this miracle of homogeneity bounces along in the background, occasionally brightening the room with a riff or a harmony or a phrase or a touch of electricity that betokens writer-producer Smokey Robinson expressing himself. ""Your Wonderful Sweet Sweet Love"" and ""Floy Joy"" and ""Automatically Sunshine"" aren't prime Smokey. But they're choice, meriting my most generous Muzak rating.

Winner of a Sony talent contest at 19, he uses amateur technology to define a private dreamworld rather than a public space, and he cracked black radio almost instantly, going pop with the DIY cockiness of his rapper homeboys. This is electronic cocktail soul as thrill-a-minute mood music, and as usual the secret is rhythm--playful riffs and echoes and synthetic percussion setting off a hopelessly slight, totally supple voice.

FALSE,B+,I Can Help,Billy Swan,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7941,"
As befits an unknown one-shot who names his album after his big single--especially a single that advances the rockabilly moment eighteen years--Swan has made an LP with a B side. Only it's one of those B sides thrown together so casually that you find yourself attracted by its elan. Programmed with ""I Can Help"" are four listenable examples of Swan's detached singing style, all separated from nostalgia by wacky absurdist touches. But on side two the absurdism is provided solely by Swan's willingness to waver perversely off pitch on otherwise straightforward tunes from Elvis Presley, Charlie Rich, and C. Boone, whoever he is. It's only a sloppy quickie, but I like it.

Any rockabilly who sings ""I'm still me and you're still you"" as if he's boasting, or trying to, knows the intense nervousness of good old macho in a way Carl Perkins only had nightmares about. Which is why this record is as good as it is, and also why it isn't any better.

Chagrined with Billy's tendency to cope with maturity by hitting himself over the head with violins, I almost didn't give this a chance, which would have been a shame--it's simple and gentle and steadfastly tuneful, mostly domestic with a few winsome courtship songs to prove he's a Nashville pro. Theme: ""Not Far From 40."" Still loves rock and roll, he says, and I know just what he means.

With percussion techniques borrowed from the scrap industry and a guitar bottom that lows like mechanical cattle and howls like the wind in a zombie movie, this is no wave with five years of practice, too messy for mysticism and too funny for suicide. In the great tradition of their live sets, it gets wearing, and lyrics are available to suckers on request. Not only isn't it for everybody, it isn't for hardly nobody. I think it's a hoot.

FALSE,B+,"The House of Friendly Ghosts, Vol. 1: Featuring Khaira Arby",The Sway Machinery,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15516,"
This strange record would mean less without the bound booklet written by guitarist-vocalist, cantor's grandson, and transcultural seeker Jeremiah Lockwood. And it would mean rather less than that without the three songs by Saharan diva Khaira Arby, whose own Timbuktu Tarab is more consistent but less gripping. The band comprises Lockwood, a drummer, and three horn players who add major oomph to Arby's stately, impassioned showcases. Camels grunt, children trill, women chant. And then there's Lockwood, a deeply pretentious guy who sometimes puts his transculturalism over, but don't count on it. Thank Allah that Arby contributes some backup vocals as well. Thank Jahweh too, I suppose.

Side one is pure pop for then people, eight pieces of punchy Chapman-Chinn bubblegum from the mid-'70s glam band whose cross between T. Rex and Slade made the competition look both authentic and inefficient. Songs like ""Poppa Joe"" and ""Wig Wam Bam"" will take on the spiritual resonance of ""Chewy Chewy"" only if you happened to reside in Britain when they were dominating the airwaves, but give them a few spins and they'll push your fun button. Side two is more problematic, summing up as it does the period after they parted with Chapman-Chinn to write their own songs and earn their own royalties, or so they thought.

Frustrated because I couldn't grok Bluroraimeemann even after isolating their tunes and turns of phrase, I turned to another pop album I'd never gotten and had a revelation. Not a new idea--what a difference a band makes is old theory by now. Just an experience--this particular band at the moment of this recording, two or three or four guitars layered into densely striated sludge with shiny ribbons of metal sticking out. Perfect for accustoming confused young adults to his sensible truisms about romantic commitment.

FALSE,B+,Fool Around,Rachel Sweet,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2854,"
Two compositions by (ousted?) svengali Liam Sternberg have been replaced on the U.S. release by prime, straightforward rockers. This makes sense. Like Tanya Tucker, Sweet thrives on simple material, and while I like Sternberg's catchy, thoughtful songs, their fussy, uncolloquial moments don't suit Sweet's hot-teen persona: Deborah Harry might sound charmingly klutzy on the rhythmically overwrought ""Cuckoo Clock"" or ""Suspended Animation"" (""I could wait for any duration""), but Sweet just sounds like she's following instructions. Unfortunately, both these songs were left on the LP, while natural Sweet stuff like ""Just My Style"" and ""Truckstop Queen"" (on Stiff's Akron anthology) were omitted. This doesn't make sense.

When Harvey Fuqua brought Sylvester back to the vinyl wars last year, he was seeking a disco hit. Well, eureka--""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"" is a real mutha for ya, one of those surges of sustained, stylized energy that is disco's great gift to pop music. In fact, the whole first side is classic dance montage. Side two proves that Sylvester remains incapable of impersonating Cissy Houston or Eddie Kendricks, though he's getting closer, and n.b.: on the most convincing cut he strays down into his speaking voice.

In which Mr. S. stretches his two best tricks--for thrills, a supernal burst of sound too sweet for a shriek that he unlooses well above his normal falsetto range; for romance, a transported croon--over a consistently satisfying four-cut disco album, with help from his own Martha Wash and the Labelle-without-camp of Hodges, James and Smith. The title track tinges Sly Stone with Andy Warhol, but the tour de force is a remake of Ben E. King's ""I (Who Have Nothing),"" and you know what? Its artificiality suits the schlocky lyric at least as well as King's virtuoso dramatics.

Funk's answer to the Thompson Twins conflate the organic and the electronic more blatantly than Prince.

Nick Lowe Title Pun Trophy: ""You Are in My System.""

FALSE,B+,Melting Pot,Booker T. & the MG's,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7955,"
Here the Memphis motorvators surpass the somewhat boxy rhythms that have limited all their albums as albums except for Uptight, which had vocals. Al Jackson's solidity, a linchpin of rock drumming as surely as Keith Moon's blastoffs and Charlie Watts's steady economy, is unshaken by the shifts the arrangements demand, and his deftness permits a more flexible concept in which Booker lays back some on organ and Steve Cropper gets more melodic input. A Vegas-jazz (""L.A. Jazz Song"" is a title) boop-de-doo chorus upsets the balance of side two pretty badly, but for the first twenty minutes this is unbelievably smooth without ever turning slick.

Always skeptical of live albums, I note that this is their second in a four-year period that has netted only one studio job while establishing them as a world-class live band. Number one was a useful overview; number two is a soundtrack, albeit for the finest concert film I've ever seen, that repeats three songs from the overview and four from the studio job.

Where Paul Simon appropriated African musicians, David Byrne just hires them, for better and worse--this is T. Heads funk heavy on the horns, which aren't fussy or obtrusive because Byrne knew where to get fresh ones. What's African about it from an American perspective is that the words don't matter--it signifies sonically. The big exception is the glorious ""(Nothing But) Flowers,"" a gibe at ecology fetishism that's very reassuring in this context.

FALSE,B+,Ain't It Something,James Talley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1655,"
The country populism on Talley's previous album was vague enough to suit Johnny Cash or Charley Pride (not to mention Jimmy Carter) and went with mawkish love songs and some dubious B.B. King guitar. This one is as tough culturally/politically as Tryin' Like the Devil, as tender romantically/domestically as Got No Bread, and puts in some James Brown funk where it belongs.

Led, not to say dominated, by an impressive twentysomething singer-songwriter-guitarist named Ousmane ag Massa, this Tuareg guitar group came together at a Western-funded private school designed to protect the desert people from a Malian educational system that's stacked against them. They're vocal about their debt to Tinariwen, founders and leaders of their musical/political movement, but from the opening riff of their 2010 debut they don't favor Tinariwen's austerity. ""He watches a world in movement evolving beyond him,"" that song translates, and they want better than to watch. Quite often you can hear how much.

It's so simple even arrant schlockmeisters like Lambert and Potter can pull it off. You'll need a dynamite single to set the mood, of course, but if you're patient and work hard there'll be an ""It Only Takes a Minute"" every year or two. Make sure a couple of the other entries from your songwriting mill are of top quality (""Ready, Willing and Able,"" ""In the City"") and then--this is important--fill holes with outside material (Edgar Winter, George Clinton, AWB) for variety. So how come no other disco-oriented vocal group has produced a satisfying album this year? Might as well ask why money is green.

FALSE,B+,Genuine Houserocking Music,Hound Dog Taylor and the Houserockers,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8474,"
The HouseRockers were the Ramones of Chicago blues, cutting three wonderful, virtually indistinguishable albums before Taylor left this self-composed epitaph in 1975: ""He couldn't play shit, but he sure made it sound good!"" His secrets were cheap equipment, a slide fashioned from the leg of a kitchen table, and the most enthusiastic reliance on ""Dust My Broom"" since Elmore James. It's completely fitting that this all-new album should be almost as fine as the two that came out of the twenty-cuts-a-night 1971 and 1973 sessions from which it's culled, yet somehow reassuring that it doesn't quite match up. Taylor slurs too much, quite a claim in this context, and ""What'd I Say"" and ""Kansas City"" are bar-band throwaways, by which I mean that George Thorogood, Taylor's chief epigone, could do them better.

FALSE,B+,Koko Taylor,Koko Taylor,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7975,"
Taylor sounds like you always wanted those women with Big in front of their names to sound--powerful, even rough, without ever altogether abandoning her rather feminine register. But though mentor Willie Dixon is the greatest contemporary blues composer, he's no more reliable album to album than any other song factory--the best lyric here, ""Love You Like a Woman"" (""But I'll also fight you like a man""), isn't his. Terrific production, though--his soul devices are so crude and obvious they're funny, amazing, or at least odd.
"
FALSE,B+,I Got What It Takes,Koko Taylor,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1949,"
Taylor's first album in three years illustrates the difference between blues as (theoretical) pop music on Chess and blues as (theoretical) art music on Alligator. There's a certain hothouse quality to this album--it's devoid of endearing, enriching commercial vulgarities. But both band (featuring Mighty Joe Young and Sammy Lawhorn on guitar and the endearing Abb Locke on saxophone) and material (from Taylor and Dixon through Elmore James and Magic Sam and Ruth Brown to Otis Spann's unnecessarily theoretical ""Blues Never Die"") range beyond Chess's commercial strictures, which more than makes up.
"
FALSE,B+,The Earthshaker,Koko Taylor,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7977,"
Considering its size, Taylor's voice has never been what you'd call rich--she flubs the pitch quite a bit, and on the slow ones she's often sounded flat emotionally as well. But it retains amazing presence--by now it's deepened and roughened so much that her late work for Chess sounds girlish by comparison. Two or three of the slow ones here really drag, always a crippling flaw in Chicago blues, but the uptempo stuff is exemplary--the songs are fun as songs, and the guitar on her latest remake of ""Wang Dang Doodle"" is ace.
"
FALSE,B+,Queen of the Blues,Koko Taylor,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8475,"
This is definitive only in the sense that any good Chicago blues album is. But she does sink her chops into some exceptionally well-conceived songs on the A, and on the B she's got Albert Collins, Son Seals, and Lonnie Brooks sprucing things up guitarwise. Also, not a slow one anywhere.

Title tune's the only time they've yoked melody/noise/sound and sense/nonsense/paradox at optimum archness without undercutting either or both. The other one with words comes close. The two instrumentals only partly fulfill their modest mission in life, which is fusing strum and skronk.
"
FALSE,B+,The Blow Up,Television,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8478,"
John Piccarella and I annotated this eighty-five-minute tape because guitar heroes like Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd deserve a heroic live album. While the more word-heavy songs worked better in the studio, on the likes of ""Foxhole,"" ""Prove It,"" and ""Marquee Moon,"" ahem, ""Verlaine takes off in directions that even he probably didn't anticipate, indulging a lyrical wanderlust he never permitted himself when he had time to think about it. And Lloyd, always constrained by the necessity of getting his solos and rhythm riffs just right in the studio, goes nuts here--what he wanted to express on `Satisfaction' was so beyond his chops that he would regularly unwind his bottom E string, twist it behind the neck, and tense the guitar like an archer's bow, producing the unearthly noises preserved for posterity on this cassette."" You also get two other key covers and a definitive ""Little Johnny Jewel."" But the sound could have been brighter--cf. Arrow, the bootleg disc where I first encountered the finest of these performances. And so, as with so many ROIR cassettes (and commercial tapes in general), audio makes the difference between a laudable document and living history.

FALSE,B+,Television,Television,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3435,"
I prefer the more rocking, songful old Television, but it's a tribute to Tom Verlaine's conceptual restlessness and force of personality that in a world where alternative guitar means making noise or mixing and matching from the used bins, these four veterans have regrouped with a distinct new sonic identity. Droll, warm-hearted, sophisticated, cryptic, jazzy yet unjazzlike, they sound like nothing else--except, just a little, old Television, mainly because Verlaine has ignored the Lloyd Cole jokes and refused to alter his voiceprint.

The producer gets one side--live ""funky music,"" a song about white people that's actually nasty, and the Franz Mesmer Memorial Version of ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone,"" all 11:45 of it. The group gets the other--sweet ballads of varying quality plus three minutes of easy Isaac Hayes funk. The album is their best of the decade--mostly on the strength of the producer's side.

Separating the jokes from the japes, eschewing atmospheric preciosity, and climaxing with two great pieces of lovesong schmaltz that define the group's seriousness, this is as consistent a 10cc LP as you can buy. But I miss oldies like ""Johnny, Don't Do It,"" ""The Worst Band in the World,"" ""Oh Effendi."" And I still don't believe ""Dreadlock Holiday"" is ""Safe European Home"" in corporate-rock drag.

The Sylvester homages of house-circuit fame are attractively soulful if a mite specialized--slower than us old-timers like our dance music, especially when we're not dancing. But from the first scrapes of its pseudosynth violin vamp, ""That's the Way Love Is"" shouts H-I-T--a classic pain-of-love cliche, all hooks and harmonies and going to the bridge. That it never broke pop is why old-timers get mad at Paula Abdul. The followup is a touch slower. I'm rooting for it anyway.

Terakaft are a livelier Tinariwen spinoff/breakaway featuring grooveful guitarist Diara and two spry nephews. Like all Tuareg musicians, they were exiled by the Islamist takeover of northern Mali, when, as several cryptic translations suggest, so many friends became enemies. Which may explain why this album doesn't manage quite the lift of 2011's Aratan N Azawad even with production input from Afropop good guy Justin Adams. Under the circumstances, lift's a lot to ask. But it is what they broke away for.

Tex is a novelty artist whose subject is morality, so that in one song a little old lady brains a mugger with a can of sauerkraut, in another Tex advocates tolerance for ""sissies,"" and in a third he sings a humorous chorus about having his hands cut off--all over some very punchy dance tracks by James Brown out of Stax-Volt. Amazingly rich and spirited for a comeback album off a freak hit.

In which an obscurity named Ben Barnes who probably doesn't want the press to know his age or how he brings in the extra-musical funds I'm sure he needs offers an object lesson in how to pull a lot of ass by projecting a sly, dirty sweetness, and in how to write striking songs about pulling a lot of ass by adding tunes to his winsome tales and come-ons. The catchiest of all is called ""Suicide Notes as Love Notes,"" and is preceded by one called ""Dr. Nuegurl"" that begins ""Dr. Nuegurl looks at me and says/That's what you get for fucking a 20-year-old."" The finale is called ""Happily Ever After,"" and I hope for the sake of whichever woman he's singing it to that he means it. For his sake too, actually. He is kind of attractive.

It's an old trick, this articulateness-in-inarticulateness, but in the words, the singing, the drumming, even the guitar (though you can tell the guitarist wants to be good real bad), this joke hardcore band that got lost on its way to college definitely has a bead on it. Start with side two, which rises from the singer as jollied-along asshole into smart and almost straight dope on Pleasant Valley teens, then quickly devolves into won't somebody come over, unhousetrained dog, demented half-audible vamp, and ""Tree 'n Sven Orbit the Planet,"" which is an instrumental, as it damn well better be.

Billed as greatest hits but actually just live, and not especially well-chosen by my no-more-or-less-idiosyncratic-than-theirs lights--where's ""How Can I Sing Like a Girl?""? And of course there are bait cuts, new songs their wee fan base presumably can't live without. What I wouldn't have figured is that ""Doctor Worm"" (""I'm not a real doctor but I am a real worm"") and ""They Got Lost"" (trying to find a radio station so low-watt it fades out no matter which way they turn), are my favorite things on a record that includes ""XTC Vs. Adam Ant"" and ""Meet James Ensor,"" reflexively clever titles I include as a guarantee that the songs live up to them.

They're such novelty nuts that trying to get into a groove with them would be like trying to build a go-kart with Legos. They're about individual pieces, not structural strength, and thus always demand a count. My calculation: overlooking the nine subminute snippets--most annoying even at that length, with bows to the nine-second ""Tick"" (""If it wasn't for that tick/We would not be in this predicament/Not be in this predicament that we're in,"" over and out) and the 24-second closer (she neither killed him nor made him stronger)--that leaves 16 songs that pretend to be songs, including one A plus, two clear A minuses, and six close enoughs. One of these is as strong as--and more soulful than--anything in their catalogue: the 2:04-minute biography ""Tesla."" Thumbs up as well to ""Black Ops,"" because it's always fun to hear the word ""communist"" in a song, and ""Replicants,"" because for some arbitrary reason it tickles me. The arbitrarily amusing--their specialty.

How about that--it's Peter and the Wolf. Thomas is a cabaret artist now, more at home for better or worse with arty Euroswingers like Chris Cutler and Lindsay Cooper than he ever was with roots-rockers deep down like Richard Thompson and Anton Fier. For a while there, his whimsy seemed arid and forced. Here, once again, he's palpably ""Enthusiastic.""

I assume they reprised the title song because they thought it was a sure shot, but they miscalculated, which is too bad--this album could use a sure shot. Thomas is deep, the material intelligent, and the mix of soul and disco disarmingly offhand. I like every cut except the gris-gris-for-tourists ""Princess La-La."" But I don't love a one of 'em.

Including an unredundant remake of a tune that merited two versions on his best-of as well as two other '80s hits he left off it, which was slick, this 2015 recording was cut in Accra, mixed in Berlin, and features Afrobeat trapmaster Tony Allen here and there. On ""Oye Hasem"" especially, second banana Ebo Taylor's horn arrangements get wearing, and Thomas definitely needs those chestnuts to tone up his tune stock. But for a new Afropop album with a subgenius frontman who has to be 60 by now, a stroke.

Moderate fame and/or extreme divorce has rendered Thompson predictable. He writes well-crafted songs about his love life, and while most of them are pretty good, only ""Fire in the Engine Room"" packs the old metaphorical wallop and only ""You Don't Say"" sneaks in the old emotional double-take. He does take leave of himself on ""Walking in a Wasted Land,"" the generalization level of which betrays yet another pop pro who should get out more, and whose guitar isn't going to save him forever.

From his vintage bike to his veiled belief that Salman Rushdie had it coming, the innate conservatism of this policeman's son is manifest, and at times his prejudices about artistic substance produce meaningful threnodies of no immediate artistic interest. But even the boring stuff goes somewhere, and nobody throws a meaner party. His tales of sex education and old 78s are so cranked up and cranky you wonder how you ever could have thought fun would be easy, and he gets almost as much mileage out of not understanding women as George Jones. Wonder whether George could get through the changes of ""I Misunderstood."" Or add a little zing to ""You Dream Too Much.""

I wish there were an American folk duo that combined such engaging music with such committed intelligence. (The McGarrigles don't count--they're Canadian.)

Back to Fairport conventions after their El Lay lies vanished into the ether, and of course it's a disgrace that an ""independent"" label won't let Americans hear the stomp and clang and clamor of real folk-rock--Richard's storehouse of strange licks, tunes, and styles just add to his axemanship, and Linda's acid contralto is a lead instrument. But though only the heavy-handed title satire lacks surface charm, the songwriting is thin--too many ordinary ideas aren't twisted the way his most striking phrases would have you believe. Also, are ""Justice in the Streets"" and its praise-Allah chorus about Teheran? Or am I just being paranoid?

FALSE,B+,Big Trash,The Thompson Twins,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6128,"
No one cares, but this is their best by miles. The singing is as characterless as ever, but at last their brains show, and when their well-named homage to Blondie and the B-52's adduces Salvador Dali, it leaves no doubt that they admire him as a charlatan, not an artist--or at least that they regard the two callings as closely related. So maybe the B-52's should hire Bailey/Currie when they need something catchy and meaningless, as they do. Deborah Harry did just that last year and wound up with a side-opener.

Next to Grand Funk, they're the country's top touring act, and they sell singles in the multiple millions besides. They're slick as Wesson Oil. And when they choose the right material and go light on the minstrel-show theatrics, they're fine--next to ""Maggie May,"" ""Joy to the World"" is the most durable single of the year. Their albums do vary--avoid the ""Joy to the World"" vehicle Naturally--but I think this is the best. Even if you're hostile, you'll have to concede that any group that can string together great-but-obscure songs from Marvin Gaye, Joni Mitchell, and Moby Grape without inspiring a rush back to the originals has something going for it. Wish they'd cut the poetry reading, though.

Things seem to be winding up for the Kings of Oversing, but this fourteen-song compilation demonstrates that the singles, unlike the albums, didn't diminish much. It also suggests that though they're praised when at all for translating weirdos like Nilsson and Newman into AM, they also deserve credit for preserving the odd goody (two apiece) by the likes of Paul Williams and Hoyt Axton. Only Lighthouse keeper Skip Prokop proves beyond help.

Don't you wish you knew some Americans who could cop snatches of Jimmie Rodgers and the Golden Gate Singers and ""Don't You Start Me Talking"" and ""The Night Has a Thousand Eyes"" without imitating any of them? These are guys who not only consider it their mission to keep rock and roll ""The Devil's Music"" for as long as the world goes to hell, but who also don't want the world to go to hell.

With its DOR beat and football-disco chorale, the title track of their sixth EP since 1983 is a deceptively catchy antiyuppie rallying cry, and all three tunes on the B--especially ""Crazytown,"" the theme song of a hundred more forgettable bands--are worth hearing twice. This is more than can be said of the B fodder on EP number five, Death of the European, soon to be rendered altogether extraneous by the appearance of its title track on their second album.

There's half a carload of new songs from a writing machine that's already filled two LPs and two EPs since 1985.

The Johns' maiden release, 1982's ""English White Boy Engineer,"" exports the U.K. equivalent of Timbuk 3's nuclear science major to South Africa, where he blames the bad stuff on the Afrikaners. Great. But in general this reminds us that a single is what a cult band puts out when it doesn't have enough songs for an album. Some of it is upstanding rant, like ""AWOL."" Some of it, wouldn't you know, is EP-tested, like ""Brainbox"" and (that again?) ""Death of the European."" And some of it is pure B-side, like the beatbox showcase ""Two Minute Ape.""

For the how-many-hundredth time, it's the punk miracle, here performed by late-twentysomething singer-guitarist Kory Seal with help from older sister Jessie Seal on drums and backup vocals plus a bassist friend. The tempos are brisk but seldom speedy as the tunes mine the nursery-rhyme and playground-chant riches of punk drone and whine, with Kory laying in guitar hooks whenever he intuits we might be getting bored. His core attitude is earned alienation, his ""I'm always just gonna be me"" neither boast or self-laceration. By living ""Paycheck to Paycheck"" he earns the right to dis the ""Struggling Artist"" whose parents pay the rent. But he backs it up by branding ""fuck the government"" ""an excuse,"" by admitting he should ""interact with people,"" and by wondering where the ""Lonely Webcam Girl""'s parents are.

Either they're the best Senegalese band to surface since Baaba Maal's or David Murray has gotten a hell of a record out of them. A conflict-primed groove launches Tidiane Gaye's tenor into transports of falsetto, and jazz-steeped guest altoist Abdoulaye N'Diaye links Dakar to New York more idiomatically than Murray could have. Their name, meaning something like Work-Reward, is the slogan of Cheikh Ibrahim Fall, a leader of the same Sufilike Muridist brotherhood that counts among its adherents Youssou N'Dour and Senegal's current president.

True folkies, the MacDonalds evolve toward lyric sincerity--or on the debut single, an obvious stiff (which doesn't mean a terrible song), straight sarcasm. Occasionally they get away clean--""A Sinful Life"" tugs at my heartstrings for sure. But crooked sarcasm remains their special gift. I'm happy not to know whether they consider the disco champs of ""Dance Fever"" winners or losers in the end. And I wonder whether their latest foray into tape technology, ""Sample the Dog,"" couldn't break from further out in left field than ""Future's So Bright"" did.

""Dirty Dirty Rice"" is the single, and before you say, ""Just what we need, another song about soul food,"" give them credit--that would be ""Dirty Rice."" Dirty dirty rice is a street delicacy available in the dumpster of your local Popeye's, and releasing singles about such stuff could keep them on ""the B side of life"" for the rest of their natural days. Since they not only cop to the prospect but can live with it--""I like my free time and I love my wife""--I predict that their songs will remain winsome and wise for as long as the record company puts them out. And that they could hit the jackpot again without trying.

This is certainly the most ""conceptual"" of the three Morris Day showcases, but ""Jungle Love"" certainly digs as deep a pocket as ""Cool"" or ""The Walk,"" and the two spoken-word tracks are outrageous, weird, and waggish enough to hold up against Morris's dubious (mock?) confessional ballads on What Time Is It?

In a misguided attempt to correct for personal affection, I underrated these Akron prog-jokers' 1979 Contents Dislodged During Shipment, their only major-label and non-retrospective album. So I'm not about to make the same mistake with this one just because my wife and I wrote the liner notes (for free, speaking of personal affection). It's a hodgepodge of course, including several unusually useful live or otherwise alternate versions. But after putting it aside for a while, I find that it rarely lets down as it herks and jerks between free jazz and tight postpunk and theoretical Zombies and the usual array of key changes and tempo shifts in pursuit of what I once dubbed ""the eternal secret of the whoopee cushion."" The official album's better, and I am a fan as well as a friend. But why shouldn't I be?

Musically, Oakland's finest is a throwback, his repetitive monotone trailing midtempo drum-machine beats embellished by low-tech scratches, simple bass and guitar lines, and other synthesized band noises. Not exactly uplifting, either--though he extols the hard haul that got him his Benz, he accepts ""freaks"" and ""rock cocaine"" as viable career alternatives, and in general is as matter-of-factly despairing as anyone who opposes suicide can be. Thing is, despair suits the ""City of Dope,"" the generic urban dystopia that the hards down south half-wittingly glamorize with their fancy samples and staged defiance.

FALSE,B+,Toots in Memphis,Toots,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4024,"
From Sam or Dave or Wilson Pickett these oldies would be the latest nostalgia move, but Otis's greatest student has always been shy of the soul songbook: for him, a new batch of reggae is the past he can't escape and Stax-Hi the chance of a lifetime. Like all aging soul men, he can no longer flush out the gravel at will, but the vocalese is incorrigibly exuberant, the material ranges within the concept, and Sly &amp; Robbie synthesize the unimaginable groove you'd expect.

FALSE,B+,Reggae Got Soul,Toots and the Maytals,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4021,"
In Toots the physical voice is all but equivalent to the artistic ""voice,"" the way that term is applied to poets sometimes, and all its warmth, humor, and vivacity come through here. But what has made Toots doubly impressive is the amazing hit songs his voice was attached to. For starters: ""Sweet and Dandy,"" ""5446 Was My Number,"" ""Monkey Man,"" and ""African Doctor."" None of these has been released on an American Maytals album, and nothing on this album, not even ""Rasta Man"" or ""True Love Is Hard to Find,"" equals any of them.

FALSE,B+,Pass the Pipe,Toots and the Maytals,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8009,"
This isn't as well-crafted song for song as Reggae Got Soul, but because it doesn't assume that ""soul"" equals U.S. success it's a lot less confused, and I like it more. The music's momentum is unimpeded by bad faith, and the three compositions that do stand out--especially ""Famine,"" as amazing a juxtaposition of horror and good cheer as Jimmy Cliff's ""Viet Nam""--sound like great ones.

FALSE,B+,Toots Live,Toots and the Maytals,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8511,"
Toots's spirit and improvisatory verve merit a concert LP, and for a while I thought this one might double as a best-of--I was even ready to hold my fire on the inevitable remake of ""Funky Kingston"" when offered the first U.S.-album version of his magnificent ""5446 Was My Number."" But the exigencies of crowd control induce Toots to work that bittersweet ex-con's victory cry as a shoutalong, and when something similar happens to the climactic ""Time Tough"" I give up. Toots's ability to exult in suffering (cf. the unfortunately omitted ""Famine"") may be a miracle, but loaves and fishes it ain't. So why should a multitude join in?

Since there's more ""world music"" than anybody can hear, not to mention enjoy, often preferences are arbitrary. No aficionado of Spanish romanticism, I've never gotten into salsa, but I happened to go see Toro at S.O.B.'s, where I was won over by his unassuming fingerpicked mastery of the cuatro (kind of a large 10-string mandolin), as well as the unassuming cornball showmanship of his group. Maybe that's why I like his sweet mountain record better than, say, Daniel Ponce's hot city record or Nana Vasconcelos's big ethnomusicological record on the same label, or maybe it's because I've always resisted horny bands while favoring the simple charanga this vaguely recalls. A salsa trumpeter I know says he likes it too--sound reminds him of Penguin Cafe Orchestra.

What's most impressive about this music is its sinew. The tracks are strong, yet although they usually include at least seven instrumental parts, they never sound lush, full, or even jubilantly multipercussive, which given Tosh's increasingly ominous lyrics is a good thing. Yet while Tosh's lyrics are more correct politically than Marley's, they're only marginally more eloquent. His singing is rather less eloquent.

Who knows what got him--some combination of ganja and the screws beating him half to death just when his music took its definitive downturn in the late '70s. Anyway, by finessing his recent past--only four tracks less than seven years old--compiler Neil Spencer camouflages the sad deterioration of one Jamaican artist whose hazy alienation always had a political edge. Sly &amp; Robbie, great Mick Jagger cameo--it's enough to make a charitable person forgive the insufferable ""Mystic Man,"" which is of course included.

Toussaint relies on overdubbing to camouflage his often colorless delivery and occasionally colorless songwriting. But if going solo stretches him thin, it also stretches him--the phasing-and-saxophone on ""Goin' Down"" is a producer's dream come true, ""Victims of the Darkness"" is recommended to Norman Whitfield, and on ""Out of the City"" he reminds us that in the country ""the grass is greener on every side.""

Among the attractions of this compilation of disco hits going back to 1972 are three snappy originals, Mr. Bass Man, a rock and roll version of ""Zing Went the Strings of My Heart,"" and a disco version of ""Sixty Minute Man"" that divides him in two.

The five-minute version of Wilson Pickett's ""Ninety-Nine and a Half"" is the key to this album. Jimmy Ellis can't match the depth of the original, and neither can the rhythm arrangement, which is light, festooned with horn licks, fanciful if you like it and just fancy if you don't. But if you like it it's not only fanciful but functional--that is, danceable. As are the other six cuts on this album, the two forgettable ones as well as the four catchy ones.

There's limited outreach in any tongue to songs about your right to pursue a musical career albeit--translation from the Bamanan provided--""Brought up by the rules of the nobility/Forbidden to sing or speak in public."" Escaped from the Malian troubles in Paris, she recorded her fourth album with Polly Jean Harvey adjutant John Parish, and musically they get results--from the opener on out, Scottish drummer Seb Rochford and Italian guitarist Stefano Pilia make Mali rock in ways unknown to Oumou Sangare or Bassekou Kouyate, and Traore is less pretty in turn. But non-Bamanan speakers may well find that her supple vocals are no more engaging should they follow her unremarkable spiritual tribulations in English or French. And non-Bamanan speakers who only start paying attention with the rote English-language populism of the continental and womanist praisesongs at the end may never go back and read along.

With his rotogravure cover and spare instrumentation, Nashville's hot new thing cultivates an aura of neotraditionalist quality, as is the fashion these days. Fortunately, the quality at least is real. He sounds like an unspoiled John Anderson singing the material of a lucky George Strait.

Travis doesn't get lucky on this one, which is dragged like most country albums by its quota of ordinary--maybe ""Singing the Blues"" should be ceded permanently to Guy Mitchell.

Not Afrocentric enough to hear this indubitably progressive pastiche as a groove album, I cut-by-cutted it, and I'm glad I did.

As always, the auteur with his name in big letters has a mild voice and a mild sense of humor: in this case, he used to be in the Sopwith Camel and cuts his pastoral whimsy with a synthesizer.

EPs are still supposed to showcase emerging bands, but many of the best are true ends in themselves if not totally sui generis, like this impossible answer record, which proves who was the body and maybe soul although not brains of the Velvet Underground. With forever-young Jad Fair playing front man, they run through three joyous VU obscurities, a Jimmy Reed blues, and a throwaway instrumental just the way the original guys might have if jaded hadn't been their thing.

The illusion of commercial potential that induced the Velvets to tighten up without squelching their experimental impulses can't be sustained by any Moe smart enough to have come this far, and so, encouraged by her loony Half Japanese bandmates, she wastes valuable minutes fucking around. Songs meander, her third ""Bo Diddley"" in three albums still doesn't get it, the endless instrumental is Sonic Youth in runny jam mode. Except for the jam, it's all nice enough--Tucker's modest middle-aged housewife is an innovation in much the way her drumming once was. But ""Work,"" ""Spam Again,"" and ""Hey Mersh!"" are Amerindie knockouts, lived postpunk takes on the grind and release of lower-middle class adulthood, a subject rock and rollers usually leave to Nashville company men.

But she and Ike really put their increasingly unfashionable rough-and-greasy notion of soul out there, and despite the speeches, backup singers, and guitar demonstrations a lot of their show is captured in disc. The band crackles, Tina is more intense than in the studio versions, and Ike provides basso humoroso commentary. And not only that but they eat each other! Right on the stage!

Tina hasn't regained her voice, which makes this recovery a certain rather than a likely fluke, but I find happy accidents in every cut except maybe ""Drift Away."" Highlights include the nutball title hit, a stripped-down ""River Deep, Mountain High,"" a tribute to East St. Louis's ""Club Manhattan,"" and ""That's My Purpose,"" keyed to a line I happen to be a sucker for: ""Let your face be the last I see.""

Charges that Tina has betrayed her precious heritage come twenty years too late--not since she and Ike reeled off five straight r&amp;b top-tens between 1960 and 1962 has she pursued the black audience with any notable passion. Her benefactors of the late '60s were Phil Spector, Bob Krasnow, the Rolling Stones, and the Las Vegas International Hotel, where she and Ike were fixtures at the time of Elvis's comeback; their big numbers of the early '70s were the totemic rock anthems ""Come Together"" and ""Proud Mary."" That she should now realize the pop fabrications of white svengalis is just a couple more steps down the same appointed path, and she's damned good at it, even an innovator--Private Dancer remains the archetypal all-singles all-hits multiproducer crossover, and Whitney Houston should be so soulful. Unfortunately, the follow-up musters no archetypal crossover singles, and no totemic rock anthems either (Bryan Adams induces her to go metal, which is more than Bowie or Knopfler can claim). Fortunately, ranking svengali Terry Britten gets his own state-of-the-pop-art side. If he and Tina can't convince you that rich people have feelings too, you're some kind of bigot for sure.

They're ten-year pros from Jamaica's north coast--rather than Kingston, hence the title--whose hotel gigs have taught them the ins and outs of soul (and doowop?), and though this isn't as upbeat as their signature ""Rasta P'on Top,"" it shows a range no competing harmony group approaches.

The music of this Harlem crew is loud beats anchored to spare guitar, the hip hop obverse of death metal if death metal didn't always strain for drama. In between the bleakest, strongest crack track ever and realest, losingest prison track this side of the Lifers Group comes the autobiography of some Nino Brown or other, only the last we see of him he's still counting his money; fuck Bensonhurst, he says, but that doesn't stop him from enslaving his own people, and the rappers append no warning, no moral.

After much listening, I am not convinced that Tyner is the total pianist. True, there are more ideas per minute on his simultaneously released solo album, Echoes of a Friend, than on Keith Jarrett's Solo Concerts. But the mystical empty spaces that Jarrett explores or exploits do have an irreducible validity that a bad idea does not, and unfortunately, Tyner is not above bad ideas, especially those Tatumesque flourishes with which jazz buffs satisfy their craving for soppy romance. (Why is the rock an droll fan listening to solo piano albums at all? The rock and roll fan is not always sure himself.) But Tyner's failings, which aren't major anyway, are less egregious in an ensemble setting like this one. At its best, this music breathes with a lushness and lyricism that never cloys: the melodies and harmonies and polyrhythms are sensuous without coming on about it. Strength that never offends.

Unlike most of her cocharting cofemales, Ullman has undertaken a conscious genre exercise--she plays girl-group tradition for naive if not dumb passivity. The songs new and old are tuneful and right, the production exquisitely not-quite-schlocky, but just-compare her ""Bobby's Girl"" to Marcie Blaine's original--Ullman sings with too much force and skill to make the conceit convincing. On the other hand, it's probably her musical conscience that saves the project from unmitigated ""ironic"" condescension. ""They Don't Know"" did hit at face value, after all.

After a year of fix-it-in-the-mix, the gutsier audio of this long-awaited U.S. version just doesn't transform the harmolodic guitarmaster's Rough Trade debut into a sow's ear. It's still too stiff, too composed, too contained, not (primarily) because the sound is too thin, but because at a mean 4:20 the tracks are too damn short. The compositions are so brilliant they never relax or rock out, and Olu Dara and Oliver Lake get in David Murray's way. Hemmed in by crossfire, the sextet never finds room to wail with the ecstatic power of the classic Tin Palace quartet, which always did justice to what Ulmer loves about his three favorite local rock bands--not just the arrant Colemanism of the Contortions, but the surprising harsh angularity of the Voidoids and the climactic dynamics of the Feelies. Though they implode with more brains and soul than any fusion mucksters, they never bust loose. Which is half the concept, right?

FALSE,B+,Free Lancing,James Blood Ulmer,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1630,"
Ulmer's conception is so audacious, so singular, that he can't cut a bad record--his most pro forma moments would make you sit up and notice ordinary jazz-rock. But despite his uncanny one-take double-track drone and the polyrhythmic facility of Amin Ali and Calvin Weston, I find the trio format thin here, and the three lyrics are trivial compared to ""Are You Glad to Be in America?"" and ""Jazz Is the Teacher."" Recommended to unbelievers and George Clinton: the hard, horny funk of ""High Time.""
"
FALSE,B+,Part Time,James Blood Ulmer,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8542,"
Cut at Montreux around the time of Odyssey, Ulmer's strongest LP, this repeats four titles and is close to his weakest. The live recording dulls his sonic concept, with only ""Swing and Things,"" compacted into 3:27, providing compensation. Which isn't to say he doesn't still outrock Pat Metheny, or that ""Encore,"" the most striking of the three new tunes, shouldn't get an encore.
"
FALSE,B+,Live at the Caravan of Dreams,James Blood Ulmer,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8543,"
Decked out like a rent-a-pasha on the colorized cover, bellowing/muttering lyrics he might as well be making up on the spot (""Gonna get me a cow and dick around""?--nah, can't be), Blood's too wild and woolly for his own good here. But if wild and woolly is the price of live and well, his admirers should be happy to pay up.
"
FALSE,B+,Live,"The James ""Blood"" Ulmer Blues Experience",1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1633,"
The advantage of this live album over Ulmer's studio blues isn't choice material but excess guitar. He's a more proficient (jazz) composer than (r&amp;b) songwriter and a more exciting player than either. His funky rhythm section has slipped into blues-rock, and that he was one of the first jazzmen to understand why Hendrix treated his axe as a noisemaker doesn't mean he commands Hendrix's palette--although he's gotten louder with the years, he still reverts to single-string lines. But with Sonny Sharrock dead, he smokes the competition. Guitar diehards should get hip to this wild, solid cross-section of a seminal genre buster.
"
FALSE,B+,Systems of Romance,Ultravox,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8060,"
This time these guys have mastered their concept. John Foxx's detached, creamy baritone works against the instrumentation's electronic cast for a streamlined rocksy music that suits titles like ""Dislocation"" and ""Someone Else's Clothes."" But unlike Bryan Ferry Foxx talks as if he's detached clean through, unlike Brian Eno he's encumbered by delusions of existential significance, and unlike both he's never funny.
"
FALSE,B+,The Undertones,The Undertones,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3889,"
Nice lads, nice lads--suddenly the world is teeming with nice lads. I like their punky speed and adolescent authenticity, but I'd prefer the reverse--among adolescents these days the speed takes care of itself, while finding something besides teendom to write about is a problem.

FALSE,B+,Positive Touch,The Undertones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8546,"
""Here's more songs about chocolate and girls/It's not so easy knowing they'll be heard""? No, that was last time. Here's still more, and it's even harder--not being sure whether they'll be heard or not (at least in the land across the sea) is worst of all. Nevertheless, the boys are equal to the task--just about every one of the fourteen is catchy and felt. Almost inevitably, though, the arrangements are a little fancier, to no special avail, and the same goes for the subjects. Good luck, lads.

FALSE,B+,Dream Sequence,The Unknowns,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8547,"
Near the top of the post-power pops, nasty and catchy instead of cute and same, is a Georgia-rooted L.A. quartet led by a guy who wields a mean-looking cane and suffers mean-looking tics, both of which he seems to need. Former Rachel Sweet svengali Liam Sternberg recommended the offbeats and echoed guitar that twist these loose-limbed tunes so neatly. Start with side two, which starts with ""Suzzanne.""
"
FALSE,B+,Lethal,UTFO,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8552,"
They got no principles, so they head for the street, where rap albums sell--with its skeezer, its hard-on, and its dozens, even ""Let's Get It On"" isn't radio-ready. At their most B-boy, they tempt me to organize a boycott of my fellow ""suckers"" and ""fags,"" but they do it with flair, and though the quotation marks around ""Lethal"" and ""Diss"" will be widely misconstrued, they satisfy my admittedly flexible irony requirement. Not only that, ""The Ride"" is a dick rap that burns rubber, and ""Burning Bed"" is a better half's revenge.
"
FALSE,B+,War,U2,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4062,"
The deadly European virus that's always tainted this band turns out to be their characteristic melodic device, a medieval-sounding unresolved fifth frequently utilized by monks in Hollywood movies. In other respects, however, their hot album is rock and roll indeed. The Edge becomes a tuneful guitarist by the simple expedient of not soloing, and if Bono has too many Gregorian moments his conviction still carries the music. Anyway, I'll take his militant if pacifist Christianity (""The real battle has begun/To claim the victory Jesus won"") over most of the secular humanism and Jah love rockers are going in for these days.
"
FALSE,B+,The Unforgettable Fire,U2,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4063,"
Eno has shaped this record to accentuate Bono's wild romantic idealism, and while I prefer his moral force I have to admit that the two are equally beguiling to contemplate and dangerous to take literally. The romanticism gets out of hand with the precious expressionism of ""Elvis Presley and America"" (enough to make the King doubt this boy's virility), the moralism with the turn-somebody-else's-cheek glorification of Martin Luther King's martyrdom (death stings plenty where I live). But he gets away with it often enough to make a skeptic believe temporarily in miracles.
"
FALSE,B+,Rattle and Hum,U2,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4065,"
Pretentious? Eux? Naturellement, mais that ain't all. Over the years they've melded Americana into their Old World riffs, and while Bono's ""Play the blues, Edge"" overstates this accomplishment, their groove is some kind of rock and roll wrinkle. This partly live double-LP is looser and faster than anything they've recorded since their first live mini-LP, with the remakes of ""Pride"" and ""Silver and Gold"" and ""Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" improved by both practice and negligence. A good half of the new stuff could knock over unsuspecting skeptics, the B.B./Hendrix/Dylan cameos are surprising and generous, and as a token of self-knowledge Bono concludes a lecture on South Africa with a magisterially sarcastic ""I don't wanna bug ya."" Yet as usual things don't get any better when you decide to find out exactly what he's waxing so meaningful about.
"
FALSE,B+,Never Too Much,Luther Vandross,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8554,"
In music as tactful as this, where so much of the meaning is carried on the skip and flow of rhythm and timbre, songwriting doesn't matter all that much. So Vandross can attach tropes like ""sugar and spice"" and ""she's a super lady"" to undistinguished melodies and make me like them. But when his touch is just a little off, the great hit single you've just heard (or at least the good one that's sure to follow) seems almost as forgettable as the loser he's singing.
"
FALSE,B+,"Forever, for Always, for Love",Luther Vandross,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8555,"
Well, depends on what you mean by love--like any studio habitue Vandross is a sensualist at heart, an aural libertine who revels in sheer sound at the expense of any but the most received sense. His voice is so luxuriant I can understand why fans go all the way with him. But only on ""She Loves Me Back"" (set apart by the hard K at the end of the title phrase) do I really love him back myself.
"
FALSE,B+,The Night I Fell in Love,Luther Vandross,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8557,"
Though Vandross's devotion to pure singing will always be too pure to admit much content, his material has improved. Marcus Miller makes the fast ones hop to, and the ballads retain their shape no matter how far Luther stretches them--only dud's the ridiculously well-named ""My Sensitivity (Gets in the Way)."" On ""It's Over Now"" Mr. Nice Guy even orders his treat-him-bad woman to ""hit the road""--although it is his femme backups who utter the actual words.
"
FALSE,B+,1984,Van Halen,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8562,"
Side one is pure up, and not only that, it sticks to the ears: their pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops. Side two is consolation for their loyal fans--a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called ""House of Pain.""
"
FALSE,B+,Vanity 6,Vanity 6,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8565,"
The latest Prince creation is a male fantasy even if the girls did write the lyrics themselves, and Vanity's insistence on seven-inch dicks would have made me feel insecure before I discovered hormone treatments. But all eight of these dumb, dancy little synth tunes get me off when I let my guard down, and most of them are funny, hooky, and raunchy at the same time.

FALSE,B+,Van Ronk,Dave Van Ronk,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8064,"
Although I've always thought Van Ronk was hard to listen to--after all, his range is about half an octave--what he does with songs by fellow ""nonsingers"" like Peter Stampfel, Leonard Cohen, and Randy Newman makes me think some more. He shoots his shot at big-label production here, and now and then the orchestration (not to mention the material) turns surprisingly schmaltzy, but for the most part this shouted melee of song collection is a riot.
"
FALSE,B+,Sex With an X,The Vaselines,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15921,"
Back when Frances McKee and Eugene Kelly were charming the eyelashes off Kurt Cobain, they were a couple, and when they stopped being one they stopped being the Vaselines. Twenty years later give or take, they were friendly exes who'd never really found anything better to do. So to have some fun and pick up a spot of change, they got together and, no longer able to extrude their couplehood, instead said ""Let's write some Vaselines songs."" Title notwithstanding, there's somewhat less sex in these, and listeners who set store in self-expression might conclude that the slight dip in urgency reflects the new material's factitious origins. Compared to so many reunion albums, however, it's like they never left. Simple, funny, acerbic, tuneful, they're a cabaret act for people who can't play their instruments but have some facile friends with nothing better to do either.
"
FALSE,B+,Couldn't Stand the Weather,Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3344,"
The problem with guitar virtuosos is that most of them wouldn't know a good musical concept if they tripped over it, which happens just often enough to keep everyone confused. The exception that proves not a damn thing is Jimi Hendrix, the finest guitarist in any idiom ever. Though he comes close sometimes, this Texan ain't Hendrix. But between earned Jimi cover and lyric refreshment, album two is almost everything a reasonable person might hope from him: a roadhouse album with gargantuan sonic imagination.
"
FALSE,B+,Soul to Soul,Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8566,"
All right, all right--he's a great guitarist, and an intermittently commanding vocalist. Unlike most Hendrixites he can step a sharp shuffle, and unlike most Texas boogiemen he's a great guitarist. But he's still not a great or even commanding artist, because the classic album he has in him, Jimi Boogies, keeps getting ruined by installments of Stevie Ray Shows Off. This moves along right nice, especially on side two--until Vaughan elects to close with a long slow soulful one that only gets going with a Hendrix coda.
"
FALSE,B+,Stop Those Songs,V-Effect,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8568,"
Either Ann Rupel's vocals and David Zonzinsky's vocals and sax got squashed in the machinery somewhere or else their cheerful onstage chutzpah concealed chronic difficulties with breath production. Too bad--few bands anywhere make better rock and roll on the edge of artistic and political struggle. This may be because, as Zonzinsky likes to say, they're ""leftist"" rather than ""political"": their clarity of purpose helps them avoid the ingrown cacophony that their supposed comrades consider an improvement on programmatic oversimplification.

FALSE,B+,Velocity,The Vels,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8571,"
These three Steven Stanley-produced Philadelphians don't just dance in their heads. Not only do they command the spare formal pop eloquence that many popdance minimalists claim and few get next to, they have a generous regard for pop pleasure. Their simple hooks add up to full-fledged tunes, their basic-English lyrics are more than runes. And singer Alice DeSoto is unaffected and vivacious, a rare combination.

A taste for mbube, isichatamiya, ingoma ebusuku, or what these notes call cothoza will never come naturally to Americans, but if Ladysmith got you interested, try this. The sharp, nasal leads are dominated for the non-Zulu ear by waggish effects that are probably more sound than sense anyway--whoops, rattles, repartee, animal calls. In short, it's not especially beautiful, which is good. How many Joseph Shabalalas can there be? How many do you want?
"
FALSE,B+,Words from the Front,Tom Verlaine,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3992,"
Verlaine's ever-resourceful guitar has always been more richly endowed with mood and effect than with the hook riffs that make him a great rock-and-roller, and here for the first time things get too atmospheric. ""Postcard From Waterloo"" is a classic, but the strangulated vocals and expressionistic structures suggest that he really should get out more.

That's as in Afrikaner--e.g., vocalist/bassist/drum programmer Ren������������������ Veldsman, who cut this strange little record with Michele Howe two ""Sun City."" It's all rhythm and soulful chants/shouts that with the help of the electronic drums come across distanced rather than passionate. This seems appropriate, somehow--I don't miss the cloying sincerity of such white Africans as Johnny Clegg and Tony Bird. And n.b.: beyond a pleas to ""Save Crocodiles"" on the back cover, there are no politics here at all.

One band with two names so it could record over quota when it managed the journey to the studio in Nairobi, Vijana Jazz Band and its Koka Koka Sex Battalion doppelganger favored the typical East African iteration of soukous's rippling guitars. Sometimes this approach is compared to country music, but that's a metaphor, not a musical analogy--these guys aren't true soloists, and rarely is Nashville guitar so ramshackle. In East African rumba, guitars provide atmosphere more than content. The content's in the jocosely hectoring vocals and single-line saxophone interjections, which with this enjoyable little band are numerous and various enough to engage non-Swahili speakers who find some of the melodies warm and others tepid.

I give up--I've never been capable of resisting music this silly. At least this time they're not singing the praises of ""macho,"" a term whose backlash resurgence is no laughing matter, and the gay stereotyping--right down to ""The Women,"" every one a camp heroine of screen or disc--is so cartoonish that I can't imagine anyone taking it seriously. As for all the straights who think ""Y.M.C.A."" is about playing basketball, well, that's pretty funny too. But what happens when Victor Willis follows Teddy Pendergrass into sololand and reveals the wife and 2.4 kids in the closet?

He lived in England after almost dying young there, which was all this greasy-looking, airy-sounding ex-sailor needed to become a rockabilly legend. But Stateside he's remembered, when you get down to it, for precisely one record: his first and biggest, ""Be-Bop-a-Lula."" I bought it in 1956 and instantly adjudged its Elvisoid B side, ""Woman Love,"" a perfect cartoon of slavering lust, an opinion I hold to this day. Although he's a better legend than artist, Vincent and his Blue Caps also deserve credit for the chart-certified ""Bluejean Bop"" and ""Lotta Lovin'"" as well as a string of lesser rockers. Topped by ""B-I Bickey-Bi, Bo-Bo-Go"" and the barely chart-certified ""Race With the Devil,"" these include ""Git It"" and ""Baby Blue,"" neither of which I'd heard before his company put Vincent back in catalogue with this overenthusiastic CD-market compilation. But there's also the inexplicably omitted ""Who Slapped John?"" and ""Five Feet of Lovin',"" and ""She She Little Sheila,"" supposedly slated for a followup devoted to his Later Work. I await the second Fats Domino. And swear you should hear ""Woman Love"" once before you die.

If Jonathan Richman thought he was as sexy as Richard Hell, he'd come on like Gordon Gano. And if you believe Jonathan Richman damn well is as sexy as Richard Hell, which Gano is counting on, remember that what makes Jonathan's kiddie act so (shall we say) appealing is that he counts on nothing except his fingers and toes. Gano knows his stuff--the barely electric music is striking enough for rock and roll. But for all its undeniable humor and panache the effect is precious, wimp bohemianism so self-congratulatory it'll be sucking its own wee-wee next time we look.

If you can imagine mid-'70s Eno hung up on the Flesh Eaters (or a Gaelic counterpart that's somehow escaped my notice) and the Boomtown Rats, you'll get an idea of how these metronomic, exotophile Irishpeople sound, if not of why I enjoy them so thoroughly--which is probably because Eno abandoned the mid-'70s all too soon.

FALSE,B+,Feet on Fire,Virunga,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6162,"
Samba Mapangala is no titan--just a persistent pro with studio smarts whose career path took him to East Africa instead of France. A women's wedding song retrofitted with male chauvinist lyrics provides a stolen high. There are telling touches from English session men playing sax and accordion. And the record is definitely his kind of soukous anyway.

First side's got everything an insatiable Mission of Burma (or H������������������sker D������������������) fan could ask except Richard Harte's production, which might do justice to the band's command of detail.

Finally an album that captures the half of Mission of Burma who didn't turn to chamber music--the half that's half joke band--in all their half-assed glory.

They've learned their lessons well, ripping off riffs from everybody--what can you say when two slapshticking ex-Mothers steal a melody from a Graham Nash protest song?--and filtering it down into the finest pasteurized mush. For some reason, it sounds a lot like the Turtles. A charming exercise in the deliberate throwback category, a true artyfact. Recommended: the Hawaiian novelty, ""Nikki Hoi.""
"
FALSE,B+,Get to the Heart,Jane Voss & Hoyle Osborne,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8582,"
There's only one Irving Berlin song here, but it's Berlin's vulgar, magnanimous, democratic tunefulness that Voss claims for the folkie sensibility. And though her voice sure isn't as strong as Bessie Smith's, as she's good enough to point out in another tribute, she also wants to wail and moan. So where Joan Morris does Berlin by simulating the careful pitch and intonation of '20s pop singers, who still cowered in the shadow of operetta, Voss flats her melodies shamelessly, sounding half like a jazz improviser and half like Sister in her cups and/or parlor. Pianist Osborne is squarer than need be and composer Voss sometimes runs on at the mouth, but get to the heart they do.

FALSE,B+,You and Your Sister,The Vulgar Boatmen,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3901,"
These guys make much more than you expect out of what first sounds like almost nothing--just tuneful enough to warrant play two, their mild jangle gains sweetness and kick as your faith increases. But their lyrics come from an English prof who may be too much the formalist to say what he wants but more likely just doesn't know what he wants: hoping for more ""Change the World All Around,"" what you get instead is six minutes of ""Drive Somewhere."" It's such a great riff you wouldn't care if it kept going, either. But an honorable, self-aware nowhere is where it'll end up.

This expanded version of Solomonic's 1979 In I Father's House isn't primo Bunny. Even the nicely dubwise ""Rockers"" is flatter than side one of Rock 'n' Groove; what's more, the sacramental Tribute and the upful Hook Line 'n Sinker have me waiting on his soon-come live album. Nevertheless, this is a worthy sample of the unjudgmental preachments and reliable rhythms of Jamaica's solidest solo artist, and if you buy it maybe there'll be more.

Though his voice echoes more hollowly than the most scientific dubmaster would ever intend, the only concert the man's given in seven years sounds like it was a natural thing. His best studio albums have more distinct identities, but this is where to sample his invincible spirit.

FALSE,B+,Album II,Loudon Wainwright III,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8073,"
In which Wainwright untwists the dense associations--usually too literal and/or analytic to qualify as metaphor--that made his first album so hard to take, though for those who'd like to sample the mode ""Be Careful, There's a Baby in the House"" is as good as it gets. He may make you laugh, but he's not trying to be funny--this is bitter stuff whether he's trying to persuade a groupie to save his life or to explain that an old friendship has gone from backslap to handshake.
"
FALSE,B+,T Shirt,Loudon Wainwright III,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8074,"
Loudon seems to be approaching sanity as he approaches thirty, and while that bodes well for his career it won't help his (you'll pardon the expression) his art much. He needs one song as astonishing as ""Rufus Is a Tit Man"" every time out.
"
FALSE,B+,Final Exam,Loudon Wainwright III,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2129,"
The renewed bite here seems more a sign that producer John Lissauer has a knack for the exquisite programmatic effect--check out the Roches' demure buffoonery on ""Golfin' Blues"" or the way the band calls Loudon ""Mr. Guilty""--than that Wainwright is once again willing to apply his scalpel to himself. It was always brave, painful jokes like ""Motel Blues"" and ""Kick in the Head"" that gave the rest of his funny stuff its strength, and their absence from his two most recent albums may be why even his best new songs sound like one-liners rather than comic classics. Lotsa great one-liners, though.
"
FALSE,B+,A Live One,Loudon Wainwright III,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2130,"
The cheap seats are the only seats at a Wainwright show, and too often he plays to them, but here the screwy faces and strangled diction and spastic phrasing and easy jokes are kept in check. It's not as if his albums are so ornately orchestrated that the man-and-his-guitar format is a breath of fresh air. But he's a singer-songwriter who deserves a best-of, and this will do till he gets it.

FALSE,B+,I'm Alright,Loudon Wainwright III,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8588,"
Last time he was complacent in defeat, his irony all sarcasm and his permanent postadolescence an annoying bore. This time he's facing up--not to anything existential or absurd, that stuff comes too easy, but to what it might mean to make an alright career (and life) out of ""unhappy love."" The result is discernibly superior to the perfectly enjoyable one-liner miscellanies of the late '70s and not quite there even so. Just rooting for the Rangers and having his doubts about bell-bottom pants once made him a (very minor) prophet; now they make him normal. My suggestion: a concept album about having kids.

FALSE,B+,More Love Songs,Loudon Wainwright III,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8589,"
With regret and trepidation, I'd venture that divorce has been good for his songwriting--after almost a decade of hit-and-miss, this is his second straight to lay down an attitude. The two tracks that tackle the split head-on aren't clever enough for Nashville, which with this clever bastard is a plus. On the other hand, the wit of ""Man's World"" is subsumed by its antifeminist rancor, so that after ""Unhappy Anniversary"" side two rides on attitude alone.

FALSE,B+,Therapy,Loudon Wainwright III,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2131,"
He makes fun of it, and why not, but it's been good for him--the only time he revels in what a mean bastard he is you'd think he was describing somebody else. Not only has shrinkage sharpened his instinct for love's twists, it's gotten him musing about his great subject, parenthood. In ""Thanksgiving"" he rankles and dreams, in ""Me and All the Other Mothers"" he braves the playground, and in ""My Father's Car"" he's insecure about his dad, his mom, his kids, an ex-wife, and the state inside of 2:21.

His 1993 Career Moves did the live folkie best-of as right as it's ever been done. A decade on he's more half-assed--men's-lib lite from History, redundant third ""Westchester County,"" nothing off 2001's Last Man on Earth because his label changed (again). But with a couple of exceptions the songs were strong to start and improve in context, and there are five (out of 17) new ones--every one a winner, three played for laughs if you count ""Something for Nothing,"" which is about file-sharing. Know what? The old fart's against it, although he's too sarcastic to come out and say so straight. Know what else? He may convince you. This is a man who's been making mincemeat out of hippie muscleheads since Timothy Leary was a visionary.

Since he's also a mind-boggling original, however, next-big-thingers are sure to fib about the pleasures of his debut. He can write, and he'll write better; his voice has no obvious precedents, and he'll learn to define it. But for the nonce what he has to offer depends mostly on his piano, played to suggest amateur lieder or the accompaniment at rehearsals of Oklahoma!, and the compositional gift of a melodist whose songs seldom snap shut on a sure-shot refrain and incur no discernible debt to blues materials. Especially as embellished by Van Dyke Parks, whose nutball Americana has been waiting for Wainwright since Brian Wilson vacated the premises, his talent is too big to let pass. And if that doesn't make his hyperromanticism easier to take, there's no point being narrow-minded. Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle it ain't. But a hell of a lot more actualized than Loudon Wainwright III.

FALSE,B+,Wasn't Tomorrow Wonderful?,The Waitresses,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3907,"
You know what kind of waitress Patty Donahue is--the kind who's waiting to break into the arts. A little scatterbrained, maybe, but she can use ""alarmist"" and ""plotted"" in declarative sentences. Not only is she believable, she's full of insight--only the Springsteenian ""Heat Night"" fails completely, and to make up there's the anti-Springsteenian ""It's My Car."" But only ""No Guilt"" is the tour de force that any man who sets out to create feminist rock and roll had better go for every time out, which may be because Chris Butler never asked all those women he interviewed what kind of music they liked.
"
FALSE,B+,Bruiseology,The Waitresses,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3908,"
Instead of cutting back on verbiage, Chris Butler solves his clutter problem by revving the music up so high it blares over its own complexity. The result isn't something you'll listen to all the time, but for most of us the same can be said to Ornette Coleman and the Sex Pistols. And if Butler's thematic concerns aren't universal enough to merit such heady company, his grasp of specifics won't be denied.
"
FALSE,B+,Closing Time,Tom Waits,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8075,"
Waits has been around--one of the two songs that make this album is about driving home at dawn in a '55 Chevy, the other about contacting a girlfriend of forty years before. With his jazz-schooled piano and drawling delivery, he resembles Randy Newman more than such fellow inmates as Jackson Browne and David Blue--Newman feigns feelings for the purpose of mocking them, while Waits exploits an honest sentimentality which he undercuts just enough to be credible. He doesn't carry a tune as well as Newman, though, which gets to be an annoyance on side two.
"
FALSE,B+,Rain Dogs,Tom Waits,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3997,"
By pigging out on a nineteen-track LP that goes on for fifty-four minutes without a bad cut, Waits demonstrates how fully he's outgrown the bleary self-indulgences--booze, bathos, beatnikism--that bogged down his '70s. He's in control of his excesses now, and although his backing musicians shift constantly, he's worked out a unique and identifiable lounge-lizard sound that suits his status as the poet of America's non-nine-to-fivers. But the sheer bulk of the thing does get wearing--it never peaks. I wish he'd figured out a way to throw ""Union Square,"" ""Cemetery Polka,"" and ""Clap Hands"" into sharper relief. And realize that those might not even be his high points, or yours.

FALSE,B+,Codona 2,Colin Walcott/Don Cherry/Nana Vasconcelos,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8592,"
I don't trust music with bird noises in it, I don't trust concepts like ""again,"" and I don't trust Oregon sitarist Collin Walcott, composer of the tweety ""Again and Again, Again."" I wonder why Walcott's ""Walking on Eggs"" sounds like an Ornette Coleman tune while ""Drip-Dry,"" credited to Coleman, sounds like Walcott wrote it (sitars will out?). And when I really want recent Don Cherry I'll put on Johnny Dyani's Song for Biko and get Dudu Pukwana at the same time. But side one is the best UNESCO ad you'll ever hear. Starts with percussionist Vasconcelos's ""Que Faser,"" which sustains itself without obvious melody or beat for 7:08, and continues through the traditional African ""Godumaduma,"" a brief, elegant reminder of where Steve Reich learned his shit. And then there's Cherry's ""Malinye,"" where he states an astonishingly lovely theme first on melodica and then on trumpet before allowing the music to break into crowd noises that somehow enrich the mood, which is then picked up by none other than Collin Walcott--who by this time could sell me a used car, not to mention a brand-new day.

Producer-penned songs begin and fancy up each side, which is half the Hightone story--this would be one more piece of moderately sharp spit-and-shuffle blues without that spit-and-polish. The other half is label honchos Bruce Bromberg and Dennis Walker's insistence on artists determined to rise above--like Robert Cray, Ted Hawkins, and JLW, who must have started out emulating both Junior Wells and Buddy Guy and taken it from there.

I'm beginning to find that their slow groove has a winning depth of character--B.B. Dickerson and Papa Dee Allen get as personal on bass and congas as most rock and rollers do on guitar and piano, and their chants often say more than rock's so-called poetry. Nice to have a couple of hits for purposes of identification, too. But their very slow groove, the one that takes over side one with ""That's What Love Will Do,"" makes me think they take the whole idea of Vanilla Fudge too seriously.

Not that their displacements achieve the depth of either artist, of course--that's the point, and the self-deflation is a relief after the hyperconscious waking nightmares of the debut. Won't get them a telethon, but it's worth five minutes on David Letterman, and they no longer sound as if they regard displacement as their own nutty-professor-turned-ubermensch joke on the world.

Muddy isn't the commanding presence he used to be, but despite the three instrumentals his writing puts this album across. ""Love Weapon"" and ""Whiskey Ain't No Good"" are slow ones he thought about, Willie Hammond's ""Garbage Man"" and the high-gear ""Can't Get No Grindin'"" classic shuffles. Come to think of it, one of the instrumentals is a classic shuffle too--you almost forgive him for putting ""Dust My Broom"" through an electric piano and calling it ""Funky Butt.""

Live Muddys are flooding the market on multiple labels, with differences in quality slighter than they want you to know, but real nonetheless. What makes this well-recorded two-venue combo the choicest has more to do with sound, repertoire, and intangibles of commitment than with changing casts of axeslingers and harmonicats--the big man's basic slide is always what stands out in his bands anyway. Here he is in 1970, reasserting his distance from the just-deceased Leonard Chess's rock dreams--an old-fashioned artist returning to his legendary strengths. By Pablo's 1972 Paris disc he's gotten just slightly complacent; by Just a Memory's 1977 Montreal gig, which has better but more familiar songs, he's relaxed into a seigneurial blues entertainer. Here he still has something to prove--or find out.

Watson has been perfecting his own brand of easy-listening funk for years, and this time he's finally gone into the studio with his guitar Freddie and his drummer Emry and a bunch of electric keyboards and come up with a whole album of good stuff. The riff-based tracks go on too long but go down easy and the lyrics have an edge. Granted, Watson can't match George Benson's chops, but this is dance music, chops would just get in the way. And I prefer his Lou-Rawls-without-pipes to Benson's Stevie-Wonder-ditto.

Two big improvements for this very French packager of ear cinema. One: His movie-sample ""content"" is very much l'art pour l'art, often referencing the tools and tactics of his craft.

Those who find ""It's Raining Men"" suspiciously campy will be doubly offended to hear producer-songwriter Paul Jabara steer his reformed gospel singers into praise of the Anvil and edible men. Me, I think it's the ultimate gay disco song, four hefty-voiced black female survivors set loose on what is much more a gay than a female fantasy, and I love it--for its humor and for its uncompromising extravagance, from lyric to singing to orchestration to arrangement to beat. I tolerate the crass moments on this second long-playing contextualization because five of its six cuts make me laugh.

The live double their more bemused admirers have waited for years is indeed Weather Report's most (if not first) useful album. But it also defines their limits. This is a band that runs the gamut from the catchy to the mysterioso. Joe Zawinul is the best sound effects man since Shadow Morton. And when he gives himself room, Wayne Shorter can blow.

FALSE,B+,Best of the Vanguard Years,The Weavers,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15680,"
The Weavers brought Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly to the agora. They're where Jimmie Rodgers II learned ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine,"" where the Tokens learned ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"" where Peter, Paul &amp; Mary learned ""If I Had a Hammer,"" where the Sandpipers learned ""Guantanamera,"" where the Beach Boys learned ""Sloop John B."" True, Tennessee Ernie Ford didn't need them for ""Sixteen Tons"" nor Lonnie Donegan for ""Rock Island Line""; true, p.c. sentimentality was their stock in trade; true, female principle Ronnie Gilbert had heard too much Odetta and designated guitarist Fred Hellerman had heard too much Theodore Bikel. But Gilbert was a vital force anyway, and Arkansas bass man Lee Hays was as charismatic as Pete Seeger himself when they let him out. The Weavers' Vanguard years followed their icky pop run with Gordon Jenkins at Decca. Their radio viability kaput courtesy of Joe McCarthy, they made their living on a folk circuit they created, and their recordings from the period reflect that enforced simplicity to the songs' benefit. In deep hindsight, I find their re-recorded greatest hits no less energetic and enjoyable than the Byrds'. Starting but not ending with Seeger, they had something.

Webster's legend has never connected on record, and by coming down heavy on the soul standards retro-rocking blues fans yammer for, her much-praised label debut The Swamp Boogie Queen sold her short. Boogie as in woogie, not as in bar band, is her gift--a rolling piano style she certainly didn't invent and just as certainly owns--and here the experts get it down. The quintessential tough-talking woman with sexual needs and a heart of gold.

Like most know-nothings--""Knowledge is power/Got your books, go read 'em""--he equates freedom with individualism and wisdom with unbridled sentiment. But the Replacements were a monument to bad faith by the end, and being as it's time for him to shit or get off the pot, he shits. ""Things,"" to a woman who deserves better than the guy who wrote this song, will tempt you to forgive the songpoems about junkyard flowers and runaway winds. ""Down Love"" and ""A Few Minutes of Silence"" are new ways to say shut up. You'll want to hear that riff again--that one too. Because his official solo debut is considerably more raucous than Don't Tell a Soul or All Shook Down.

The moribund big man having bolted for CBS with the abysmal ""I Love to Sing the Songs I Sing,"" the moribund minor has no recourse but to piece together a best-of. Which is of course the best album released under the big man's name since his last best-of for the minor. He doesn't rap enough, but at least he doesn't essay any true ballads--the tag line masquerading as a ballad he damn near invented, and he's surprisingly OK on the Hollywood-Latin of ""Sha La La Means I Love You"" and the uptempo masculinity of ""I'm Qualified to Satisfy You."" Sha la la means anything you want it to mean.

Seven songs and four stories, and without question the stories have more bite. If topics like crying when your son leaves for college and coping with your father's prostate cancer seem mawkish by definition, God help ""Marlene,"" home from the hospice and dancing with her son in the backyard, or ""A Little More Love,"" White's prescription for everything this side of prostate cancer. I mean, ""Like a Friend"" makes me gag, and I'm a fan. On the other hand, the belief that stories about crying when your son leaves for college are mawkish by definition is a social disease. Those ready to combat it should avail themselves of White's humorous-to-hilarious, insightful-to-incisive antidote--cracked tunes, acoustic strum, and all.

Though I really don't believe that Esquerita and the Seeds, say, loom larger in rock history than, say, Gamble &amp; Huff and the Grateful Dead, this time I have to grant dumb-ass obscurantism its due. Whitfield isn't a genuine throwback, but he is a genuine historical oddity--an acceptable Little Richard substitute, with a band that doesn't fake it. He's not crazed or rubber-piped enough to go all the way with a frantic groove, though ""Mama Get the Hammer"" and ""Ship Sails at Six"" come close. But when everybody lets up a little, especially on semi-instrumentals like ""Walking With Barrence"" and ""Cotton Pickin'"" and the steady-spreading ""Go Ahead and Burn,"" Art Rupe would be proud. Time for thirteen tunes: an authentic 27:52.

No other r&amp;b copy band has such an in at the chicken shack that transcends all knowing, and not just because they play and sing their asses off on covers remarkable, generic, and recondite enough to get born again as new classics. They're smart enough to play cool as well--so smart that only when the chicken shack disappears (as mysteriously as it has materialized, I'm sure) do you wonder just why they're so hot to spend all their time there.

Whitfield has yet to take a composition credit on three albums whose best originals are indistinguishable from the obscure old backbeat grooves and frantic novelties that are his trademark, but he's the auteur for damn sure--just replaced his entire band, with no trace of shift or slippage beyond the two overextended blues-soul showcases that lift him over the 30-minute mark. These are merely generic because the boss has no special gift for expressive sincerity--not on the order of his gift for backbeat grooves and frantic novelties, here written mostly by his new helpers, and I dare you to pick out the ""real"" one without reading the label.

His best came last, and only those who already love the ingrained sorrow and liquored-up ease of I Wonder Do You Think of Me, which provides the four finest performances on this record, should invest in the glimmers it compiles: the way his brave front breaks through such Nashville formula as the cute longing of ""Miami, My Amy,"" the lust at first sight of ""Ten Feet Away,"" the terse lovewords of ""When You Say Nothing at All."" And in ""Tell Lorrie I Love Her,"" recorded in his living room two years before he died, a voice from beyond the grave tells us he could have sung his best any time the smart boys were ready to package him that way.

This record is more depressing than my dispassionate grade would indicate, not just because from the Who we expect better--do we, really?--but because its runaway fatalism invites dispassion. Peter Townshend has more to say about star-doubt than David Crosby or even John Lennon--he's not only honest but exceptionally inquisitive, and he's got a knack for condensing complex ideas. But despite their aper������""However Much I Booze"" and ""Dreaming From the Waist"" circle around so obsessively that they end up going nowhere; I don't expect answers from the seeker, but I do expect him to enjoy the questions. No surprise that the two songs that break out of the bind are ""Blue Red and Gray"" (which means satori) and ""Slip Kid"" (about one more imagined teenager).

Every time I concentrate I get off on some new detail in Daltrey's singing or Townshend's lyrics or Entwistle's bass parts--though not in Moon's drumming, and I still don't relate to the synthesizer.

If nothing else, Keith Moon's death seems to have delivered Pete Townshend of his obsession with the band he created--and with his own mortality. His new sex songs are stylish and passionate, the strongest he's written for the Who in a decade. Problem is, his pretty-boy mouthpiece sounds like he's forcing the passion. Which reminds me that sex always has to do with mortality--and that mortality catches up with pretty boys faster than with the rest of us.

They're not just ladies' men, they're the big brothers every B-boy wishes he had. Or so they hope. Autobiographical examples make their stay-in-school and one-love advice more convincing than most, though just to cover all the bases they don't stint with the etiquette tips (""That's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble""). But nowhere are they catchier than on the ""tag team sex"" of ""I'm a Ho"" or more realistic than on ""The Good Part"": ""But I keep going for it and I won't stop/Because I don't believe there is a good part/Because I been searching and lurching and looking real good/Because if there is a good part it ain't in my neighborhood.""

Is a two-CD package that could fit onto one conning consumers, taking on airs, or wallowing in nostalgia for a lost time when songs were songs and double albums were double albums? All three. Yet there's no point denying Jeff Tweedy's achievement as long as you recognize its insularity. His simple melodies, felt vocals, and easy stylistic sweep all evoke a past when roots music came naturally, from bluegrass to the Rolling Stones--a past he preserves by removing it to the privacy of his head and your sound system. There's no dynamism to his music--the rockers are slackers, the hooks essentially atmospheric. Yet as objects of contemplation both have their power and charm.

Though it's possible Jeff Tweedy's wife told him to stop being a pretentious tweet, it's more likely she just told him to stop ignoring her. This doesn't mean he actually was ignoring her, mind you. But too late he figured he'd better make a point of paying attention, which meant no more pretentious tweet (for the time being). On the second-best track here, he does the dishes and mows the lawn even though she's not around to appreciate it. On the best, he admits consumers have the right to think his music means whatever they want it to. Everywhere he stops soundscaping and resumes songwriting.

Williams's exquisite clarity and thrilling range have always slotted her among the perfect angels for me, but there's a lot more to her work with Thom Bell, who finally challenges Burt Bacharach on his own turf, applying strings and woodwinds and amplifiers with a deft economy that textures rather than sweetens. And Williams's lyrics, while never startling, become increasingly personal as her professional confidence grows--she's wrinkling her brow more and her nose less. Dionne Warwick fans: welcome to the '80s.

Why do demos have such a mystique? Aren't they created solely to sell songs? And if Williams's prominence freed him of the need to compromise his expression, didn't it also free him of the need to put the song across at all? I mean, it wasn't evil bizzers who forced him to record with a band--the band was Hank's pride and joy. Listen to the static singsong rhythms of these strummed solo versions and you'll know why--when Vic McAlpin (?) provides a touch of vocal counterpoint on ""You Better Keep It on My Mind,"" it's like somebody just pulled up the shades. Nor are all the obscurities as epochal as the side-openers, ""Honky Tonk Blues"" and ""Jambalaya,"" both available and then some in livelier, more crisply recorded versions. Because Williams was a genius, his alternate takes are certainly of interest, and occasionally--the slow, stark ""A House of Gold,"" for instance--they're riveting. But this is for serious collectors. Casual collectors should put their money into Polydor's complete-recordings twofers before evil bizzers kill the project.

At times his son-of-an-outlaw obsession is worse than shtick, but here he does justice to the formula. Two candid songs about women tell you more about his sexism than he knows himself, two others explain why he's in that mood, the covers from Gregg Allman and George Jones define his parameters, and ""The Conversation""--with Waylon Guess Who, about Guess Who, Sr.--doesn't make you gag once.

Then I read the notes and began to suspect it was because he wasn't having much fun himself. All rock and rollers were in it for the money, but there are degrees, and somehow I think a guy who ended up shooting himself in his Laurel Canyon mansion after 25 years of pimping and pushing might have had trouble getting into the spirit of skillfully concocted sillyditties like ""Bony Moronie"" and ""Peaches and Cream,"" or ignoring the subtext of ""Little School Girl.""

Unfortunately, there aren't. Then again, indelible these aren't--too mushy around the edges. Williams has always worked her drawl, but here the extended vowels and slurred consonants tempt one to suspect she's afraid ""We were blessed by the watchmaker/Who gave up his time"" won't stand up straight next to ""We were blessed by the wounded man/Who felt no pain."" Unfortunately, it won't, and similar shortfalls cripple ""Soldier Song"" just before. What makes me half believe I'll want to hear this album again is the drawn-out religious rumination ""Awakening,"" where vagueness signifies, and every solo Val McCallum gets. Atmospheric. Play loud anyway, so it won't be.

FALSE,B+,Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone,Lucinda Williams,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16199,"
You'll never guess--a double album that would be punchier as a single! It doesn't help that the 20 tracks average over five minutes apiece, so that the philosophical grist of ""Temporary Nature (of Any Precious Thing),"" for instance, leaches what value its no-love-without-loss wheeze has as the song refuses to end. My strategy, which I've made a reality in my iTunes folder, is to finish off the top five of disc one with--somewhat less sure-shottedly--the bottom four of disc two. The political to the personal. Nine-minute cover to wander out on. Title: Down to the Bone.

FALSE,B+,Turn It Over,The Tony Williams Lifetime,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4016,"
I'm being complimentary when I say that though Led Zeppelin II is infinitely more cumbrous and stupid it packs the same sheer clamoring rock presence. Of course, drummer John Bonham insists on breaking the mood with a solo, while drummer Williams improvises continually on a steadier beat than is ordinarily acceptable among jazz devotees--when he, Larry Young, John McLaughlin, and Jack Bruce all play together it's impossible to distinguish front and back or melody and rhythm. ""Right On,"" two orgasmic minutes of raveup energy and master chops, almost makes me believe in his quavering, enigmatic vocal lines. Unfortunately, though, it doesn't make me want to listen to them, perhaps because he uses his voice to pronounce words.

FALSE,B+,Happy Come Home,Victoria Williams,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4120,"
Sui generis it may be, yet in a great semipopular tradition: oddball folkie meets El Lay, represented by her coproducers born-again Steven Soles and bicoastal Anton Fier, as well as venerable oddball Van Dyke Parks, whose string arrangements prove him her soul brother. Her roots are in Cajunland, so naturally she sings like a cross between Dolly Parton and Yoko Ono. If you fear art damage, I cannot tell a lie, so maybe you'll believe me when I add that it's tolerable. Shoes, Jesus, merry-go-rounds, and animals--lots of animals. Hirth Martinez would be proud.

FALSE,B+,Bang Bang,Kelly Willis,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1910,"
Up till the Joe Ely conceit she goes out on, this 22-year-old doesn't get a single lyric worthy of her lusty-voiced appetite for decent love. She claims she'll wrap her pipes around any original her drummer husband hands her, but since the five on the debut are down to two here, there's reason to hope that next time her Nashville handlers will put her in touch with an actual female songwriter. Would Lucinda Williams be asking too much?

FALSE,B+,Kelly Willis,Kelly Willis,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1911,"
Willis loves singing like George Jones loves singing, like Rosanne Cash loves singing, and once a fella notices how hard she tries and how strong she feels, he'll want to hug and kiss her till that smile is back on her pretty little face. But though the tunes are her solidest yet, Don Was's Billy Bremner guitar and Jellyfish harmonies don't set them off any more clearly than Tony Brown's neoclassical taste did. That's mostly because Willis's idea of a good lyric is a simple lyric. No wordplay, no narrative, no trenchant details--just the musical statement, alive and direct. OK, honey, if you say so. But I still think maybe you should join that T-group with K.T. and Mary-Chapin.

Recorded under Wills's supervision until he suffered a stroke before the last day's sessions, this double-LP doesn't represent the band at its peak. But though earlier recordings of most of these classic tunes are at least marginally sharper, it certainly captures the relaxed, playful, eclectic Western swing groove that Wills invited in the '30s. And Merle Haggard does sing lead on three cuts.

Can it be that Joe McEwen, the candidate for sainthood who almost single-handedly resurrected Wilson from the vaults, actually likes his big-ballad mode? Why else unearth his album-only ""Georgia On My Mind""? Why not pretend that ""Alone at Last""--which reached 8 pop and only 20 r&amp;b--never existed? And what about the obsequious if pyrotechnic Copa medley? Not that any of this stuff is without interest, or that the album-only ballad ""I've Got To Get Back"" isn't a jewel. Still, I wonder.

FALSE,B+,The Soul Years,Jackie Wilson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11477,"
What strikes you first about this post-1967 material is that new black producer Carl Davis has graced it with a groove, often a fairly mellow one. And for half the album Wilson sails along on top, relaxed and confident and supremely attractive. But as the hits get scarcer the arrangements get busier and Wilson starts emoting harder. Which does him no good.

FALSE,B+,New Beginnings,Larry Jon Wilson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8129,"
A sleeper from a previously unrecorded Georgian who looks to be around forty. Capsule portrait: he named his crippled son after his father, a dirt farmer who moved to the city with misgivings, and Bertrand Russell, both of whom he ""knew and loved."" The record is as original as you might hope, catchy and fresh-sounding despite overlays of schlock intended to hook the country audience. I wish I could say it was promising as well, but I suspect not. The drawback to rediscovering home truths, which is definitely Wilson's calling, is that when the excitement fades--and even a modest career takes its toll--the reaffirmations turn back into platitudes. That has already begun to happen on the weak cuts here.

From Bayside and/or Florida, they traveled south and/or north to record with the ubiquitous but stationary Mitch Easter, who never before has gotten so close to this kind of dense intensity--the extra drumbeats, the guitars that fall apart and then right themselves, the aggressive timing. It suffers the usual limitations of homage and formal exercise--you never really notice what the songs are about even though it's part of the game to write smart lyrics and sing medium clear. But especially on ""Delaware 89763,"" which sounds like it could have been recorded at the Star Club long about 1966, they make you hear Carolina Beatlism for the romantic fantasy it is--from the Beatlemania-manqu������������������ of the Spong"

With Bobby Sutliffe off following his muse like some junior Chris Stamey, Tim Lee remains as Peter Holsapple--sinewy soul, sandpaper cry, iron pyrite hooks, the works. No way is he as clever, but he compensates with an urgency that's his version of sound and groove both, and if a few of these jangle no-fail melodies went deeper than love hurts, he'd deserve better than he's likely to get.

FALSE,B+,Venus and Mars,Wings,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8136,"
Superficially, which counts for a lot with McCartney, his New Orleans venture is his most appealing post-Beatles album--straight rock and roll with a few pop detours and one excursion into ""When I'm 64"" nostalgia. So clear in its melodies, mix, and basic pulse that his whimsical juxtapositions--robots on Main Street, Rudy Vallee cheek by jowl with Allen Toussaint--sound like they might make some sense. Don't get me wrong--they probably don't, because McCartney's a convinced fool. But when the music is coherent it doesn't matter so much.

FALSE,B+,Wings Greatest,Wings,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8139,"
Twelve songs, five of them hits not on any previous Wings album, running 54:11 in all, replete with rhythm shifts and subthemes and counterplots and flights of fancy and forays into abject nonsense. In short, pop for potheads. All I could ask is a stylus-width scratch across ""My Love.""

FALSE,B+,Johnny Winter And,Johnny Winter,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8145,"
Ex-popstar Rick Derringer represents the North--real McCoy rock guitar, contentless AM songs, dumb vocals (watch out Steve Miller here comes Dino Valenti). Ex-bluesman Winter represents the South--spacey ex-blues guitar, formless FM songs, exalted vocals (and you thought spacey ex-blues was an insult). Result: best metal since Layla.

FALSE,B+,Still Alive and Well,Johnny Winter,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8147,"
Winter will never be an especially personable singer, but I like what's he's putting out on this monkey-off-my-comeback: two late-Stones covers, plenty of slide, and a good helping of nasty. Nastiest: the Delta-styled ""Too Much Seconal"" and ""Ain't Nothing to Me,"" dedicated to the subversive notion that sometimes the impassivity of country music is a little sadistic. White blues lives: the best and heaviest track is a Hoodoo Rhythm Devils song.

FALSE,B+,Icarus,Paul Winter Consort,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11491,"
Kind of a classical/jazz mix but with none of the stiffness that suggests--inquisitive, contemplative, eclectic, peaceful. And eloquent, much more eloquent than my description, which does more for the music than the lyrics that obstruct a couple of cuts.

FALSE,B+,Is This Real?,The Wipers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8152,"
Three guys from Portland (Oregon, but it might just as well be Maine) who caught on to punk unfashionably late and for that reason sound like they're still discovering something. Which hardly makes them unique--there are similar bands in dozens if not hundreds of American cities, many of whom send me records. What distinguishes this one is Greg Sage's hard-edged vocals--detached but never silly, passionate but never overwrought--and economical one-hook construction.

""`A Serious of Snakes'"" is 154 updated technologically, rhythmically, and spiritually, which is almost to say transformed utterly--dance-trance with a nasty surrealistic edge. ""Drill"" does the same for Pink Flag. ""Advantage in Height"" is less of both worlds. ""Up to the Sun"" is a cappella noodling. Welcome back.

Waiting for my annoyance to articulate itself, I found appropriate contexts--subways, elevators, etc.--and stuck this into my personal portable. Where to my shock it proved fun fun fun. Maybe they are about to jump to Windham Hill, but only because Windham Hill wants to escape its suburban demographic. Mellifluous, deceitful background rock--but ugly, and with a kick.

FALSE,B+,Behind the Curtain,Wire,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4201,"
For Pink Flag as opposed to Wire cultists, and of course there's a difference. We prefer them at their punkest, fastest, and shortest, as with the many titles on this 1977-78 outtakes comp that didn't make any of their first three albums or the On Returning best-of, all 17 of which fit easily on one side of a C-60. These include the five live songs not on Roxy London WC2--""Mary Is a Dyke""! ""New York City""! ""After Midnight""! (Eric Clapton's!)--as well as preliminary settings for riffs that will resurface in other guises. The other 14 tracks are punker, faster, shorter, louder, and/or rougher versions of songs Wire cultists have never forgotten and never mind hearing again.

Deprived of Bruce Gilbert's guitar, these fractious lifers return to and improve on their dance-rock '80s. From the scene-setting new-wavey relationship-gone-sour of ""One of Us"" to the climactic electropunk historo-fatalism of ""All Fours,"" though not always in between, they remind you why they were a great band. But they should know better than to dis the Mekons, who still are a great band when the time seems right.

Most of side two sounds like Roberta Flack, which disappoints me even though it probably doesn't surprise anyone else, Withers included. Well, I had my hopes for this man, but then, so did all the Roberta Flack fans, every one of whom must love ""Lean on Me."" Side one, I'm happy to report, begins with a nasty song to a trendy fox who wants Bill to see a shrink! Keep it up, Bill! and he does! Pretty much. For one side. Recommended, but barely.

Though the big deal is supposed to be the way collaborator Michael Jonzun brings Wolf's r&amp;b into the space age, there's more electronic pizzazz in current Chaka or Ashford &amp; Simpson. Such sweet sleepers as ""I Need You Tonight"" and ""Baby Please Don't Go"" and ""Here Comes That Hurt Again,"" all of them originals, sound like obscure Motown covers. In short, a gratifyingly unassuming solo breakaway.

Just how low-profile the new songs are is made clear when a sweet cover of ""Here Comes the Sun"" snaps you from drugged semiconscious enjoyment to full attention. I love the relaxed groove and wavering back-porch harmonies that go into their unique sound--lazy, tender, patient, long-suffering, tired of fighting. But they don't have to get by on atmosphere.

FALSE,B+,"Signed, Sealed and Delivered",Stevie Wonder,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8160,"
Sometime in the past (can it be?) eight years, Little Stevie became Big, and so did his frantic one-smash-a-year style--wheezes, shrieks, and all. Consistent Motown albums are rare, and Wonder is still an immature ballad singer, though at least now he's covering ""We Can Work It Out"" (some ballad) rather than (I'm not making this up) ""The Shadow of Your Smile."" All the good stuff here is stuffed onto one great side--the most exciting music by a male soul singer in quite some time, and it fits no mold, Motown's included.
"
FALSE,B+,Where I'm Coming From,Stevie Wonder,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8161,"
Wonder produced and (with his wife, Syreeta Wright) scripted this escape from Berry Gordy's plantation, and as you might expect it's not entirely successful. Unlike his corporate masters, though, Wonder prefers sins of commission--he's always out on a limb, and if that means ""classical"" flutes and images like ""ride the thorny mule"" it also means the zany, stuttering autobacktalk of ""I Wanna Talk to You"" and the possible Sammy Davis cover ""Take Up a Course in Happiness,"" not to mention the most expressive synthesizers yet recorded. And unlike the manumitted Marvin Gaye, Wonder never sounds like a simp--the sentiments may be stale, but their textures are fresh.

FALSE,B+,Music of My Mind,Stevie Wonder,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3352,"
Making the most of the inevitable, Motown boasts on the back cover that ""this album is virtually the work of one man""--he plays everything but one solo each on guitar and trombone. Sure could teach John Fogerty a thing or two about multitracked spontaneity--this music is mercurial above all else. Just like the blind genius he's always compared to, Wonder transcends taste. But because the specifics are less inspired than the gestalt--which is not to say I don't love ""Love Having You Around"" and catch myself enjoying the regrettable ""Superwoman""--it doesn't quite hold together.

FALSE,B+,In Square Circle,Stevie Wonder,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8650,"
Compare this to the others in your head and you'll be hard-pressed to specify what's missing, but slap on Talking Book or Hotter Than July and you'll hear how cushy it is--polyrhythmic pop rather than polyrhythmic rock. Stevie's effervescence is so indomitable that it's a pleasure even so, but nothing rises far enough out of the stew--""Land of the La La"" is no ""Living for the City,"" ""Part Time Lover,"" no ""I Just Called to Say I Love You,"" etc. Then there's the infectious ""Spiritual Walkers,"" in which Stevie gives it up to Hare Krishna and witnesses for the Witnesses.

Problem with this budget eight-song early-singles compilation is that at close to thirty-four minutes there isn't quite enough of it. The fast-faster-fastest sequence that leads into the slow, surprising obloquy on side one is excitement itself but doesn't put the anticlimactic Suicide homage across; ""Special Friend"" shoulda stayed a B side, and ""Cold Inside"" a dub remix. And given how often youth comes to full bloom these days, this is the Woodentops to buy nevertheless.

FALSE,B+,Big Smash,Wreckless Eric,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8655,"
A strange sort of double album, half of it the compilation indie Stiff stiffed with last year, the other a supposed commercialization. The theme is ""Pop Song,"" which begins with a murmured ""Put it in your mouth"" before moving on to ""Better write a pop record/With a money-spinning hook/If the muse don't hit you/You're off the books."" 'Tis said the spunk has gone out of the lad, but though he does wax lyrical at times--I like the one where he admires the style of a girl handing in her tube ticket--he's as rude and scrawny as ever. Maybe the new stuff isn't altogether fabulous, but Stiff led with a compilation because he's mortal. If you count yourself among the millions who didn't purchase The Wonderful World of Wreckless Eric, do so now--you'll hardly notice the pop songs' rough sheen. If you count yourself among the thousands who did, ask yourself how much you love him and act accordingly. I love him moderately myself. Grade for new disc only.

You'd never guess it from ""Clean Up Woman,"" but this album is the perfect union of the Betty who has worked in the Alston studio since 1964 and the Betty who won't be nineteen until September 21--teen love in all its moral passion and sweet concupiscence. Does her voice shoot upwards on ""I'll Love You Forever Heart and Soul"" because her spirit is soaring or because he just touched between her legs? Both, I hope.

I underrated this EP five years ago because, having never seen the band play, I had no inkling of how much I'd end up valuing their live recordings--how much I'd love hearing two perfectly unmatched voices interact in the moment. The up-front redundancy of the title cut is now extended by the reappearance of the live ""Rigor Mortis"" and the formerly EP-only ""Blood and Guts"" on the free Berneice Huff mixtape. That said, I always thought the vibraphone-bedizened ""Skip"" was the choicest EP-only here, ""Sweetie"" squeaks and whooshes as it rocks out, ""Millie Christine"" adds a raw declarativeness one of their milder numbers thrives on, and ""Airborne"" is the finest version of their finest song, which leads their first and finest album. But of course, they're all worth owning. As is this.

FALSE,B+,"Berneice Huff and Son, Bill, Sings . . . Popular Favorites",Wussy,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15899,"
I claim no objectivity about this wittingly ramshackle collection of remixes, demos, live versions, covers, and ancient interview snippets except as regards the number of times I've chosen to put it on at bedtime or breakfast--partly because my wife is as big a fan as I am, but partly because I knew by play two that what nonfans might consider its self-indulgences would never obtrude. The excellent new songs are all southern Ohio covers, two from their allies in the Afghan Whigs and one from someone named Jenny Mae. But if you believe that Lisa Walker may be the finest female singer working today, and that this band has never written a song you'll mind hearing again, then alternate versions are just a way to reaccess her vocal invention and their collective touch. Even the 2:33 worth of snippets fit in--Chuck and Mark are funny guys. Available gratis, of course, to anyone who likes 'em enough to visit their website.

I'm at a loss to describe this album of ""drones and songs"" conceived and recorded after Wyatt's crippling accident except to say that the keyboards that dominate instrumentally are of a piece with his lovely tortured-to-vulnerable quaver and that the mood is that of a paraplegic with the spirit to conceive and record an album of drones and songs.

In which the CPUK turns the unwary art-rocker into Pete Seeger. Long convinced that there's no percentage in soft-soaping the masses, Wyatt is more candidly propagandistic than, say, the Weavers--no ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine"" (the Raincoats would never speak to him again), two tracks praising Stalin Foiler-of-the-Fascist-Foe. And his modernized concept of the folk enables him to transform a Chic song into a hymn. But internationalist sentiment still prevails--from Bangladeshi folk-rock to a stirring ""Guantanamera""--and so does the shameless lust for killer melodies. In fact, if Wyatt had a freak voice as universal as Pete Seeger's he might move the left-wing masses quite nicely.

Nothing like d-i-v-o-r-c-e to bring out the independent woman in you--the only marital-commitment song here is about having an alcoholic husband. And where in her domestic-paragon phase she was beginning to sound prim, here she ranges from forthright to positively hot, torching up her tales of star-crossed sex as if she's just learned how to masturbate. Point of interest: Billy Sherrill's latest collaborator on Tammy's material is George Richey, Tammy's latest husband.

Her mackstress bona fides are predictably generic despite the gender-bent pimp routine, and even after she progresses to the womanisms that dominate the second half of a typically excessive 80-minute No Limit disc, she can't very well avoid cliches: adoring her kids, mourning her G, fending off her current knucklehead, she's role-playing straight up. But especially after she expresses her love for a dead homegirl, her declarations of leather-skinned cynicism and wit's-end vulnerability take on a retrospective weight that counterbalances their surface contradictions. A ghetto story, real as fiction.

Although it took a year and a half for this debut album by the premier English art-pop band to get released in the States, two Andy Partridge songs on side one aim directly at the American market--""Radios in Motion,"" which mentions Milwaukee, surely isn't about the BBC, and the avowed purpose of ""Statute of Liberty"" is to get a look up her skirts. The third, ""This Is Pop,"" is why he missed--radio programmers resent anyone telling them their business, especially subversives who favor herky-jerk rhythms, jerky-herk harmonies, Lene Lovich radar noises, and depressing subject matter. Colin Moulding's songs, on the other hand, are aimed at bored Yes fans, which is why he missed--the lad doesn't know that Yes fans like being bored.

With voices (filters, chants, wimp cool) and melodies (chants, modes, arts cool) ever more abstract, I figured Colin Moulding had finally conquered Andy Partridge and turned this putative pop band into Yes for the '80s. But it's more like good Argent, really, with the idealism less philosophical than political--melt the guns, urban renewal as bondage, o! that generation gap. And fortunately, the melodies aren't so much abstract as reserved, with the most outgoing stolen from Vivaldi or somebody by none other than Andy Partridge.

With help from that bad corporate money, they get a striking sound out of the no-bass thing. It's both big and punk, never a natural combo, and up against the Kills it's killer--Nick Zinner commands more than any man's allotted portion of dangerous riffs. But to care about this band you have to find Karen O's fuck-me persona provocative if not seductive, and since I've never been one for the sex-is-combat thing, I find it silly or obnoxious depending on who's taking it seriously. Duly noted: two human-scale songs toward the end.

FALSE,B+,Fragrant World,Yeasayer,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15767,"
Most of the time you can half make out the lyrics and then occasionally parse them too--whaddaya know, ""Reagan's Skeleton"" is about the election, sort of, and neither ""Longevity"" nor ""Henrietta"" would mind if it died before it got old or reached 100, whichever came second. But I only made sense of this album when I decided to enjoy its sonic trickerations the way I do African music in which the verbal sentiments might compromise my pleasure if I knew what they were. It's not a groove record, that's for sure, but it has some bump and even funk to it, a dark density years away from the evolved Depeche Mode of the proudly proggy Odd Blood. And almost every track offers up at least a snatch of melody you're always glad to hear again.

If Big Youth is the dread George Jessel, then the albino orphan who's supplanted him as JA's premier toaster is something altogether more waggish and blue, an unwitting amalgam of Eddie Cantor, Mae West, and Pigmeat Markham. Though groovemasters follow wherever he goes, his albums tend to run together because music isn't really the point, and neither is political or spiritual uplift. The point is entertainment, and live he concentrates on his best material, blued up a bit to give the crowd something extra for its money. Encore: ""Sit Under Me.""

FALSE,B+,Buenas Noches From a Lonely Room,Dwight Yoakam,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1106,"
With the clout to take chances, Yoakam is out to prove that he's one mean cocksucker. On side one, hopeless jealousy metastasizes into a killing rage, and for damn sure he's more interesting that way--Jerry Lee worshippers may even get hard. Side two's Buck Owens cameo and lament for a boozer dad convince me the revamped persona is for the better. The inspirational number he wrote for his mom convinces me of nothing.

FALSE,B+,And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out,Yo La Tengo,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4249,"
The main problem with this background tour de force is that you understand not just how good it is but how pretty it is only when you listen up. The whispered guitar and pattering drum patterns, the unattainable sounds, the details of a modest love for the ages--all mean what they mean in part because they're so quiet. Yet if you don't get it, all I can advise is: Play Loud.

FALSE,B+,Testarossa,Yoni & Geti,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16881,"
The fruit of a European tour by David Cohn d/b/a Serengeti and his beatmaker pal Yoni Wolf is goofy and fanciful in Geti's signature manner. It's quite slight, quite tuneful, quite funny--""Met a woman named Ella/Used to be a fella,"" or the long list of imaginary social-media sites like ListenUp, WhereYaAt, Lick4Lick, Gwaffalo, and GrindStone. But everywhere you can feel his marriage tugging at touring's frayed tether. At long last he returns home to his daughter's new bangs, his son's homework folder, and the computer he just bought his wife. But happy about it he cannot be. ""This is just my tenderness/My wretchedness/I'm a pessimist,"" he mutters--and also, as he's mentioned before, a poltergeist: an invisible disruptor. Slight or not, if you've come to care about the guy it's pretty sad.

Like many a serenely anonymous Rastafarian tuneweaver, the former Vivian Jackson could almost be a muezzin (or three) chanting nursery rhymes, most of which concern the end of the world as we know it, a prospect which cheers him considerably. With the help of many justly famous Rastafarian session-men he's produced a typical reggae sleeper--no surprises (the end of the world is hardly news), but considerable cheer.

FALSE,B+,Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,Neil Young,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10849,"
Young is a strange artist and I am not all the way into him yet, but this record is haunting. For someone who is into him, try to find the piece Greil Marcus wrote for Good Times (reprinted in the July 23 EVO). Best rock criticism in a while.

FALSE,B+,Harvest,Neil Young,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2513,"
Anticipation and mindless instant acceptance made for critical overreaction when this came out, but it stands as proof that the genteel Young has his charms, just like the sloppy one. Rhythmically it's a little wooden, and Young is guilty of self-imitation on ""Alabama"" and pomposity on on the unbearable London Symphony Orchestra opus ""There's a World."" But those two excepted, even the slightest songs here are gratifying musically, and two of them are major indeed--""The Needle and the Damage Done"" and the much-maligned (by feminists as well as those critics of the London Symphony Orchestra) ""A Man Needs a Maid.""

FALSE,B+,American Stars 'n Bars,Neil Young,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2519,"
The first side, recently recorded, is Young's rough-and-tough version of L.A. country rock, featuring a female backup duo called the Bullets and climaxing with ""Bite the Bullet,"" his sharpest cut since ""Tonight's the Night."" The second is a journey through the past that perhaps should have stayed in the outtake can. On one tune, Neil turns into a salmon while masturbating in front of the fireplace; on another, he and Crazy Horse somehow take the wind out of ""Like a Hurricane,"" which blew everybody away at the Palladium last fall.

This is certain to become a legend on rarity alone, and if you believe mad guitar is all he's good for, you may even think it's worth a buck a minute at the $25 it cost me. I think it's versions and/or work tapes, with two otherwise unavailable songs and mad guitar that ends too soon. I'm glad to own it. But I get reimbursed.

FALSE,B+,"Road Rock, Vol. 1",Neil Young,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2540,"
Only one of the six 1969-1978 oldies that dominate this contract-conscious holding action is on any previous live album--""Tonight's the Night,"" which admittedly had more get-up-and-go on Weld in 1990. The two new titles are a girl-group hoot too good for Silver and Gold and a bitter, climactic, Chrissie Hynde-enhanced ""All Along the Watchtower."" The Keith-Oldham-Dunn-Keltner band rocks different than Crazy Horse. Definitely not dead yet.
"
FALSE,B+,Living With War,Neil Young,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13305,"
OK, more news event than musical milestone. But a really great news event--believe me, the '60s never produced an album that felt this much like a peace march. The key is the sense of fellowship, with music carried less by the artist's broad guitar and creaky voice than by loud drums, what-the? horn arrangements, and a hundred-person chorus on every song. The second consecutive Neil Young album where you know what all the words mean (following 50-odd where you didn't) specifies that this radical-of-the-moment is not averse to supporting a repentant Colin Powell. This proves him a populist if anything does.

FALSE,B+,Year of the Horse,Neil Young & Crazy Horse,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2539,"
Largest word on package: LIVE. A dozen songs, mostly at the usual midtempo stomp, more than half dating to the '70s (or '60s). Also three off last year's barely noticed Broken Arrow--one terrific then too, one improving as it gets (even) longer, one a permanent drag. The climax is Life's long-lost ""Prisoners"" (formerly ""of Rock 'n' Roll""), which climaxes with the deathless ""That's why we don't want to be good."" Men of their word, they're great sometimes and good never. And then the CD version--on Broken Arrow, vinyl was the bonus-cut format--climaxes again with a wilder ""Sedan Delivery"" than the one they thrashed out on Live Rust 18 years ago. Guy never gives up, does he? That's why his completists have more fun.
"
FALSE,B+,No Parlez,Paul Young,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8671,"
Unlike the interpretive singers of an earlier generation, Young projects a concern with emotion rather than emotion itself--an idea or a value rather than a passion. Where Joe Cocker and Maggie Bell played it hot, Young's take on the slightly archaic black singing styles he admires so candidly is cool and synthetic. while this aligns him neatly with urban contemporaries in the Jeffrey Osborne mold and helps him steal away with ""Love Will Tear Us Apart,"" it puts a heavier burden on his powers of analysis than any rock-and-roller should risk. Fortunately, his delight in state-of-the-art production and arrangement, as well as in his own vocal resources, provides the underpinnings of authenticity any second-hand man needs.
"
FALSE,B+,The Secret of Association,Paul Young,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8672,"
His fat voice even more a sign of the times than Laurie Latham's baroque production, Young is Boz Scaggs for the '80s: an honorable soul fake. It's all too much at times, but Young writes as well as Boz ever did and is smart enough to go elsewhere for the meaty lyrics he loves, including two antiwar songs that could make more of an impression than Boy George's. Be nice to think music could still do that sometimes.

Bands this funny have to be funnier than they ever are to be as good as bands this smart want to be. Which isn't to say I don't enjoy most of the jokes and treasure several, like ""When the Girls Get Here"" (""We'll talk about integrated circuits and things"") and ""Amy Grant"" (""Barry/Barry White"").

FALSE,B+,Stone Cold Rhymin',Young M.C.,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6129,"
From the bright, cute funk of ""I Come Off"" to the Q. Jones Jr.-cowritten ""Just Say No,"" he's just too clean. His polysyllables and quick lips aren't as fresh as he thinks they are, either. Much more than his East Coast counterpart the Fresh Prince, though, he has his own sparely hooky musical style--courtesy Matt Dike, Michael Ross, and the usual panoply of pop-funk geniuses past. Has his own style as a writer, too, summed up pretty well in the title--he's not a storyteller, he's a wordslinger. Fun fun fun until daddy takes the contract away.

FALSE,B+,I Came From Nothing 3,Young Thug,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16151,"
The moralist in me scoffs at the rationalization that trap-rap ""street"" tropes are merely conventions--a song called ""Molly Workin'"" has to hook harder than this one to make me forget that molly generates more fellatio providers than normally occur in nature. But the hedonist in me won't deny that gangsters grok pop's Saturday night hustle in a way moralists cannot. The turning point on this freewheeling get-together is the ""birthday bash"" Thug announces midway through on ""I'm Paid,"" after which tracks that were already coming thick and fast pick up speed as the party gets wilder and louder. One skittering synthbeat accelerates off another, ""Angry Sex"" straight on to ""I Like What Ya Doin'."" You want to know Jeffrey Williams's principles? How 'bout ""No homo/We party though/We get gnarly though/We smoke dro/We fuck our hoes/We rock shows/That's what we here fo'""? ""Time of Ya Life,"" that one's called, and given how much time he can count on, it should be.

FALSE,B+,1017 Thug,Young Thug,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16152,"
Midway in, the sonic breakout ""Picachu"" begins a five-out-of-six run interrupted only by a song from a Gucci Mane not yet put safely away--chorus fans may actually prefer the lubricious ""Miss U"" or the sanguinary ""Trigger Finger"" to ""Picachu"" itself. But don't let whatever noxious potion you're vicariously sipping cloud your judgment, because otherwise this is just a quality mixtape. However much you enjoy the bombed recipe for disaster ""2 Cups Stuffed"" or the stoned geography lesson ""Nigeria,"" it's a road to no place special with a lot of signposts on it.

FALSE,B+,Beat It Down,Y Pants,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8674,"
The notion that women's music should be cute has as little theoretical attraction as the notion that it should be organic, and the notion that it should be arty as well has less. But these three Soho gals get away with it, no doubt because at some level deep beneath the ukelele and toy piano they're willing to be ballbusters. The key is a sweet, a cappella version of ""That's the Way Boys Are"" that's, er, marred halfway through by the sound of a woman screaming in the middle distance. Every one of these (ersatz-Andean?) melodies will sneak up on you eventually, and just maybe paste you one.
"
FALSE,B+,Nights Without Sleeping,Chaba Zahouania,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=562,"
Maybe singers dominate rai where Arabic is spoken, but as an export it's producer's music. When Rachid and Fethi electrify conventional Algerian arrangements on the A, Zahouania remains a travelogue novelty for all her lowdown. Second side they go to town--the pulse and timbre and timing and juxtapositions of the indelibly Middle Eastern elements are all arrogantly eclectic in the great rock-disco tradition, only this time these priceless cultural resources are misused, and transfigured, by insiders.

This idly functional, playfully mechanical six-cut dance LP tested my tolerance for innocent mindlessness, especially after I realized that my favorite tune appears on both sides. But unlike its predecessor it is a real dance LP--side one will function your ass off. And you'll want to play ""Playin' Kinda Ruff"" again.

He's an ever-evolving one, an 81-year-old who sings this album with a warmth and verve that does equal justice to his melodic grace and his sing-song hooks.

Written for children 30 years ago, their lyrics apparently add up to an associ""Is that A for amor?"" one wonders, and maybe Portuguese speakers can figure out an answer, although that answer won't strictly speaking be Z������������������'s--the words are by his illustrator friend Elifas Andreato.

I am suspicious of singer-songwriters who draw attention to phrases like ""hasten down the wind,"" and I would suggest a moratorium on songs about the James Brothers that don't also rhyme ""pollution"" and ""solution."" But I like the way Zevon resists pigeonholes like ""country-rock"" while avoiding both the banal and the mystagogical, and I like quatrains like: ""And if California slides into the ocean/Like the mystics and statistics say it will/I predict this motel will be standing/Until I pay my bill.""
"
FALSE,B+,Transverse City,Warren Zevon,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5952,"
With his eye on the fate of the earth, from malls and gridlock to entropy and deorbiting heavenly bodies, Zevon succumbs to the temptations of art-rock. This beats country-rock, at least as he defines it, and given his formal training it was decent of him to wait until his material demanded sci-fi keybs--arpeggios and ostinatos and swirling soundtracks. With Little Feat's Richie Hayward the timekeeper, the stasis is a little heavier than anyone concerned with the fate of the earth would hope, but you don't get the feeling Warren's hopes are high enough to warrant anything livelier. ""Splendid Isolation,"" about solipsism as a life choice, ""Turbulence,"" about perestroika and Afghanistan, and ""Run Straight Down,"" about the fate of the earth on the 11 o'clock news, are exactly as grim as they ought to be.

Their boogie's gotten grander again, more nationwide than homegrown, which at its best--the euphemistically misprised ""Tube Snake Boogie"" (and did you know ""Pearl Necklace"" is Southwestern for blow job?)--means only that it packs a more powerful kick. That they're eccentric nonetheless is proven not just by the harmonizer-processed voice of evil shaking the DT's while working street PR, but by the brown-eyed mama who guards their groovy little hippie pad with .44, jeep, and German shepherd. The easy life ain't what it used to be.

Arena-rockers who never forgot heavy metal was once white blues, they took a long vacation and resurfaced as a fine white blues band starring a guitarist who always sounds like himself. Now, with hitest b.p.m.s speeding the groove, they've motorvated back toward metal again--boogie in overdrive, a funny car that's half platinum and half plutonium. The videos make you smile, the record runs you over. That's the pleasure of it.

Highlight: a poignant, four-song, solo-acoustic interlude that celebrates his conscientious objector brother in ""Ballad of El Goodo,"" looks back at his even younger self in ""Thirteen,"" directs ""I'm in Love With a Girl"" to ""the finest girl in the world,"" and then does an abrupt right turn into Loudon Wainright's desolately lonesome, predatorily horny ""Motel Blues.""

Not that she's topped the competition. But her only misstep here is a new Jeremih collab where--inevitably in a world where good sex is so often a stroke of luck--their concerted attempt to top the relaxed ""Body"" with the overreaching ""Ecstasy"" comes off forced and stiff. Romantic duets with Jacquees and Derez De'Shon aim lower and hit higher, however, and in general she sidles into money and fame brags with a reassuring ease that coexists nicely with her pitch-corrected raps and croons. So not only is she still in the game, she's upped her own.

FALSE,B+,Inferno,Robert Forster,2019,http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17516,"Robert Forster: Inferno [Tapete, 2019]
After listening so faithfully I've even gotten behind a perversely mild opener based on one of Yeats's Crazy Jane poems, I've earned the right to make two observations. One is that every one of these nine calm tracks has its attractions--""Inferno"" bemoaning a Brisbane summer so brutal it could signal the end of the world, ""No Fame"" honoring an artist who'll never enjoy the renown he deserves yet keeps imparting form to his stories anyway, ""I'm Gonna Tell It"" for some reason exploring a very similar theme. The other is that a year from now, with another brutal antipodal summer behind the planet we hope, you're more likely to choose Forster's The Evangelist or the Go-Betweens' Oceans Apart when craving a taste of this particular artist who's not as famous as he deserves to be.

FALSE,B+,Stand Tall,Jason Ringenberg,2019,http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17490,"Jason Ringenberg: Stand Tall [Courageous Chicken, 2019]
It happens. In the '80s Ringenberg came up fronting the country-punk Jason and the Scorchers, who soon ran out of attitude as punks will. But he kept at it, riding the Scorchers for whatever they were worth while clocking kiddie-music dollars as Farmer Jason and recording the occasional solo album--check out ""Rebel Flag in Germany"" and ""Tuskegee Pride"" on 2004's disgruntled Empire Builders. His articulated nasal yelp flattens out too easy, but the writing carries this album up if not quite over. Punk being the white man's blues, the sure shot is ""Thank God for the Ramones."" But how many Ramones tributes propel us toward not one but two sequoias tributes? How many John the Baptist tributes set up a tribute to how ineluctably God's rejects maintain their faith despite it all?

Exclusively Malian in both production and personnel, Sankare's second album bears his subtle stamp without matching the bite or power of his debut. In both sound and trot all the songs seem strictly moralistic and hortatory. True, ""Remobe"" (""Development starts with agriculture"") is more upbeat with a livelier solo than the solemn ""Tiega Mali"" (""Today Mali suffers--killings, banditry--we are tearing each other apart""). But though I can imagine playing ""Tiega Mali"" if something like the Bamako Radisson Blu attack happened again, as I hope against hope it never does, the likes of ""Remobe,"" fine and even fun though they are, has less apparent use value at this distance.

Somehow the raft of confused reviews that greeted VW's half-decade-coming fourth album failed to ditch the old saw that set designer's son turned Columbia scholarship boy Ezra Koenig sings the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Maybe this is because at 35 he actually does, just not the ""Ivy League"" ones of legend. More likely, however, the problem is sheer befuddlement at how complex this class stuff can be. So recognize that his rich-and-famous has little resemblance to the old-money kind. It's Hollywood rich-and-famous, and far from its upper reaches, although Quincy Jones is eight-month-old Isaiah Jones Koenig's granddad. As I hear this sprightly, allusive, elusive, technically accomplished collection, all but a few of its 18 melodic yet seldom uplifting or effervescent songs bespeak some fraught combination of lost youth, career anxiety, and, way down deep, political dismay. ""Why's it felt like Halloween / Since Christmas 2017?"" Peruse the lyric booklet and find other such moments among these honeyed puzzlers.
