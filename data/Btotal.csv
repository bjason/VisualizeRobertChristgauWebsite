FALSE,B+,Shake You Down,Gregory Abbott,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4280,"
The title single is a deceptively slight slow burn, a come-on so unassuming you don't notice you're being seduced until after you've slipped into something more comfortable, and most of the album works the same subliminally hooky con--harmless until it whispers ""gotcha,"" it's a model of consumer calculation. The persona is green-eyed handsome man with the wherewithal to support his fine tastes and yours. The songs are tuneful ditties with Bacharach/Bell chords and harmonies. And the singing is generic Spinners--growling or crooning or letting his falsetto do the talking, Abbott has learned to make the most of the edgy strain that's his unavoidable vocal trademark. There's something all too '80s about his bid to create a great love man without a great voice--if in 1971 Bill Withers was a toilet installer expressing his higher self and in 1978 Ray Parker Jr. was a bizwise craftsman selling his irrepressible formal exuberance, then in 1987 Abbott is a brokerage grunt looking to maximize his profitability. But by reinventing a black pop of modest means, he takes a first step toward returning that great crossover in the sky to the people. Wouldn't it be nice if somebody else took another one?

Popsymp enough to consider this an improvement over the far from awful The Book of Human Language (featuring ""The Balance,"" ""The Hurt,"" ""The Vision,"" etc.), I'm also streetsymp enough to hear how smug some might find the sensible moralizing and carousel hooks of ""Master Your High""--and people person enough to think ""Five Feet,"" named for the distance he wants to keep between him and you, is priggish. Still, most of these 16 tracks are sensible, moral, and hooky. And many are fun as well. Ten years a cult hero and his passion for rhyme is unabated. It would be priggish to deny him.

Hayseeds manqu������������������ who think he's betrayed his alt-country heritage should adapt to a world where traditionalism means not having a call out to the Neptunes. Tiny banjo fills, grand guitar solos, solo-acoustic, swelling strings that disguise your inability to distinguish between nuclear holocaust and breaking up with your girlfriend--they're all roots-rock now. With that tumescent ache in his voice, tunes easy as pickup lines, and a telltale tendency to vague out completely when saying anything you don't already know, Adams is a romantic egoist of the old school. Like every other alt-country hero worth spit, he assumed the pose because it gave him a way to look conceptual while knocking off some strophes. It's an excuse he's long past "

Can't claim this sustains the promise he had going for him on both sides of the Atlantic in the early '80s--that sense of limitless possibility betrayed by chaos in Nigeria, parochialism in Gaia, and the failure of Aura to move up the charts. But it's possible to applaud his development of Lagos's recording facilities and still be glad he's cut another studio album outside of Africa. A nickel short on both hook and flow, it nevertheless achieves an internationally suitable balance of detonation and quietude--and of voice, percussion, and guitar.

These boys are learning a trade in record time--even the sludgy numbers get crazy. Too bad the two real whompers are attached to rockstar lyrics, albeit clever ones, because Steve Tyler has a gift for the dirty line as well as the dirty look--anybody who can hook a song called ""Adam's Apple"" around the phrase ""love at first bite"" deserves to rehabilitate a blue blues like ""Big Ten Inch Record.""

Still, with almost a decade of bad records collective and solo behind them, there was no reason to expect a thing from this touching reunion. And against all odds the old farts light one up: if you can stand the crunch, you'll find more get-up-and-go on the first side than on any dozen random neogarage EP's.

Six of eight tracks on Corporate Revenge II were cut New Year's Eve 1984, a money gig for sure, and every one was at least eight years old at the time; a seventh previewed a song soon to appear on their Geffen debut--but recorded, heh heh, while they were still under CBS jurisdiction. And what we get is some of the toughest and least indulgent live metal ever vinylized, not quite Greatest Hits (four dupes) but way beyond Live Bootleg or Corporate Revenge I.

If fried brains is your idea of a rock dream, the first side will do the job at least as good as whatever raging slab is also your idea of a rock dream. For five songs, everything loud and acrid about them just keeps on coming--not even tune doctors can stave off the juggernaut. Of course, this band's idea of a rock dream is also the traditional ""Young Lust"" and ""Love in an Elevator""--OK as far as it goes, but I could do with more ""Janie's Got a Gun,"" in which an abused teenager offs her dad.

Lassana Diabat������������������'s balafon makes as much difference as Djelimady Tounkara's guitar, and though neither vocalist is prime, ngoni master Bassekou Kouyate packs more energy and gravity than second-stringer Eliades Ochoa even if his own solo album underwhelmed.

FALSE,B+,Ere Mela Mela,Mahmoud Ahmed,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4305,"
Because taste leads to knowledge, I enjoy fair familiarity with the West African music that's second cousin to rock and roll and none with the distant relatives in North Africa and the Middle East. But where knowledge ends, taste rules. Ahmed is a singer of unmistakable authority, and maybe an album of the ""many standards"" he's contributed to ""modern Ethiopian music"" would expand my horizons. Or maybe this is that album--I don't know. I do know that soon I lose the charge I get from the lead cuts, generated less by the ""strange, almost Indonesian-sounding scales"" of the vocals than by the two-sax horn section, which (maybe because it utilizes those scales) could be Afro-Brilliant Corners or ill-tempered synthesizer or avant-garde blues. For tastes that run to the Master Musicians of Jajouka and Om Kalsoum, he may be Elvis.

These muscular early recordings from 1972 or so, a/k/a ������������������thiopiques 6, sound rougher but no less fevered and distinct than the circa-1975 stuff collected on his certified classic Ere Mela Mela.

The title cut is the raunchiest fuck-me song in years, and the funniest: when Charlie bellows, ""I don't want you to fix my bed,"" the Misdemeanors chirp back, ""I'm not."" It just doesn't quit, and nothing else here comes up to it. But the overall level of rancor, humor, and genre experiment is gratifyingly high for what is basically an English r&amp;b album. Bang on.

FALSE,B+,Iraqi Music in a Time of War,Rahim AlHaj,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12154,"
Last February, mild-mannered Iraqi matinee idol Kazem al-Sahir played a sparsely populated Beacon. His 17-piece orchestra was exotically anodyne to me, painfully nostalgic to the attendant Iraqis. But either way it was steeped in denial. Recorded April 5 at Manhattan's Sufi Books, with Baghdad under attack, this solo oud recital is the opposite. The conservatory-trained AlHaj is a Saddam torture victim who escaped in 1991. Yet he is appalled by the destruction of his homeland. And yet again he betrays no rage: however uninspired as ""concepts,"" the ""compassion, love, and peace"" he preaches are courageous as music. With little knowledge of oud or taste for classical guitar, I'm struck by how unexotic he seems--how his sound, melodicism, and note values bridge East and West while remaining Iraqi. I'm impressed by how modest virtuosity can be in a classical tradition that honors simplicity. And I'm drawn in by the historical context, which implicates me in that tradition.

FALSE,B+,The Way of the World,Mose Allison,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14961,"
At 82, Allison has written a great song, which may seem odd given that it deals with neuron degeneration, and found an ideal producer, which is not how I usually describe Joe Henry. Ben Sidran offered him a sympathetic ear at Blue Note too, especially on 1997's Gimcracks and Gewgaws. But Sidran is a jazz loyalist with a songwriting sideline who brought out the player in him. Henry is a singer-songwriter with a jazz jones who conceived settings that would serve the lyrical gift that made Allison famous. ""My Brain"" is as right for Peter Townshend in 2010 as ""Young Man Blues"" was for Roger Daltrey in 1969. ""Modest Proposal"" and ""The Way of the World"" bring cosmic wisdom down to earth. ""I'm Alright"" is a big thumbs-up for anyone who flosses.

If Duane qualified as auteur, whatever that means, then he was the auteur-as-sideman. Over four sides (nineteen cuts, fifteen available elsewhere) he takes one vocal, contributes one original composition, and reserves his most definitive playing for other people's sessions--listen again to Boz Scaggs's ""Loan Me a Dime,"" not to mention the overlays Clapton got out of him on ""Layla."" Since Duane's only concept was the open-ended jam that so many session players mistake for artistic fulfillment, this is just as well; any format that limits the Brothers to four-minute tracks has much to recommend it. It doesn't result in very coherent albums, though. For scholars and acolytes.

Anybody who can comp for Aretha Franklin and ghost as the fifth Domino is obviously on his way to titanhood. One guitarist never made an album, though, and this is a lot more than brother Duane's showcase. Backup guitarist Dickey Betts puts in two songs of inspiration--""Revival"" shoulda been a hit--and Berry Oakley's bright ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" is a relief from the one-dimensional moan of the real leader of this band: little brother Gregg, whose ""Midnight Rider"" puts me in a forgiving mood anyway.

Finally a decent record comes out of Rolling Thunder, from what sounds like a country-rock band shocked by city living into a credible, slightly surrealistic nastiness, rather than the usual sleazy lies. T-Bone Burnett is that rare combination, a tall, inspired crazy; David Mansfield is a precocious, multi-instrumental sound effects man, and Steve Soles is a speed-rapping narcissist who can be thrown to the Poco fans. Plus a rhythm section that plays actual rock and roll. And Bobby Neuwirth in the background, where he belongs.

This unholy trio's second album is ""humbly offered in the light of the triune God,"" but T-Bone Burnett still sounds like a helluva monad to me. He doesn't know as much as he thinks he does, but when he steps aside from the songwriting the group usually falls flat--and when he pitches in, these guys could almost pass for a country-rock Steely Dan without money.

Nonbelievers consider him shrill, but I find something sweet and reflective right beneath his cool, caustic self-righteousness.

It's not easy to sound like no one else while performing what are still recognizably pop songs, and harder to remain anything like listenable in the process. But topped off by Joe Newman's ductile whine (can't call it weedy, too organic) and propelled by living bass and drums you'd swear were synthesized too, this Leeds-to-Cambridge foursome's unhurried electro-mesh is always more than pleasant and half the time mildly enthralling. ""Tessellate"" is the hit, ""Matilda"" the rouser, ""Dissolve Me"" the statement of aesthetic-erotic principle. How Brits can call them the new Radiohead beats me. But then, Brits and Radiohead often do.

So no wonder her excited new fanbase is so relieved by ""Archie, Marry Me."" Assuming the challenged couple get to cut that cake, I wish them many lubricious years of one-on-one ""debauchery""--Rankin's word, and I sincerely hope it's no metaphor.

Diligence rewarded: 10 years on the road, six DIY full-lengths, and 30-plus band members later, Reidsville, North Carolina's BJ Barham cold-turkeys the Jameson, ties the knot with Rachael, welcomes baby Josephine, and gets label financing on an album fit to introduce him to the nation at large. Beginning with the stricken anthem ""The World Is on Fire,"" he fashions songs for non-urbanites appalled by America's twin epidemics of cruelty and cowardice--for lifelong patriots negotiating the ground ""between hypocrite and hallelujah"" in what's become ""the home of the afraid.""

Anderson is Ricky Skaggs without Jesus--his voice lowdown rather than angelic, his roots in the honky tonks rather than the mountains, his album wild and blue, a sexier way to say (and sing) highways and heartaches.

By now, his irreverent working-stiff warmth is both likable shtick and a precondition of his specialty, happy love songs whose notion of permanent fun combines conjugal self-sufficiency and downhome raunch.

The difference isn't between ""spoken word"" and ""music."" The difference is that this is stories and the dull Bright Red is songs--and that right now she can better justify her obsession with the limits of American sense by telling about her travels than by devising metaphors for her displacement. Anyway, Bright Red's music retreats so far downtown from Strange Angels that it's reprised (minimally, of course) in the portentous swells and eerie punctuation employed so effectively on this album--which showcases her most striking musical talent, for recitative, even if the clipped phrases and drawn-out final consonants do get predictable.

Michael Bivins's juxtaposition of boy sopranos against dissonant jackbeats is pedagogy at its finest.

Problem is, while this 2010 album is arresting, it's also fatiguing. Of course she's singing in her sand-blasted power contralto, but over 12 tracks it's often more like she's holding forth--after all that hectoring you crave some lilt, the sense that maybe she'll dance a few steps when she does thisone live.

So in 2010 they handed production to a DFA honcho. At their best--namely, the echoing hypno-raves ""Magnetic Warrior"" and ""Wild Strawberries""--they now sound like the Seeds turning into Joy Division after somebody spiked their hash with MDA. Admittedly, they do occasionally get embarrassed and try to respect their roots--the garage kind, and even the roots kind. One way or the other, however, the singer's buried so deep you couldn't figure out what he was saying if you cared, which you don't. 'Course, sales did not ensue this time either.

They're lots bigger, so be grateful they're only somewhat broader--and that for Alex Turner maturity means subtlety, not cynicism. The herberts, paparazzi and under assistant Japanese promo men of the first few songs are rendered more generic by their big loud beats, but once Turner gets down to interpersonals his romances gone sour are tender and nuanced--check out the failed fling of ""Only Ones Who Know,"" the conflicted reunion of ""505,"" the scorned compassion of ""Do Me a Favour."" And if we have to endure songs about the superstar round, ""This House Is a Circus"" is wiser than Bloc Party's.

OK, I'm convinced. Sometimes funny, always real, and never ever pretentious, she proves that a big, husky voice needn't turn you into a self-important fool.

The secret of Armatrading's songs is their plainness, but it's also their drawback. When she hits an image--""I read your letter yesterday/It fell between the covers/And my bare skin""--she lights up a real life. More often, though, she just says what she has to say with whatever unprepossessing idiom is at hand, and her melodies are even less inclined to witticism than her words. This style of candor, engaging in theory, escapes tedium in practice by way of Armatrading's bluntly dramatic singing. Rarely have less tuneful songs so impressed themselves on my mind.

The perennially unclassifiable London West Indian meets Instant Records' Richard Gottehrer for her punchiest and most attractive album--she even comes close to laughing a couple of times. The title tune is to narcissism as ""Brown Sugar"" is to racism--she doesn't prettify it, but she doesn't forswear its pleasures, either. Suggesting to this white male heterosexual that unclassifiable may be a polite way to say unreachable--and that unreachable may be why even songs as well-realized as these wouldn't take that extra pop leap if Gottehrer weren't motorvating them.

Funk vocals are so cartoon-defined you'd figure the bassist to end up with the real band after the split. But it must have been Arrington's parts of Slave's collective compositions that made them stick. Here he proposes nothing less than to modulate the nasalities, glottal constrictions, and Mel Blanc raunch of Ohio playing into an emotionally integrated--soulful, as the expression goes--singing style. Funnier lyrics would make the task easier. Likewise funnier bass parts.

With its tape loops, orchestral percussion, and artsong timbres, this is as far from rock as guitar-based music can be; it's also closer to Eno's hypnotic repetitions than Henry Co. has ever come. This time the lyrics aren't so much attempted myths as haiku-like apothegms set in some abstract historical space. They're not great poetry, but they're not bad poetry either, which combined with the music makes for pretty good poetry.

These kids deserve to turn into teen heroes everybody can be proud of. They respect the rock and roll verities, but in a dynamic rather than an arty or nostalgic way: their instrumental wallop is powerful enough to keep them in there with the heavies, but so deft that the lyricism of their songs is left untouched. A lot of bands around CBGB will spend their lives wishing they could have gotten it together like this.

For six highly listenable, casually unmatched tracks, every beat hooks without being obvious enough about it--in a telling segue, a track that rides a Clams Casino glitch precedes a track that rides a Clams Casino Santigold cameo. Skillfully but never dazzlingly, congenially but never charismatically, with entertainment value added by a screwed-and-chopped alter ego, Rocky raps over the music without saying a damn thing older, meaner, and sharper rappers haven't said before. Then, bang, three dynamite songs, starting with an attention grabber bearing the asterisks-in-original title and literal message ""F**kin' Problems,"" followed by a f**k-you banger from the Skrillex songbook and the terrific virtual-posse ""1 Train"": hello goodbye to Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson, and Big K.R.I.T.

Not only is this token of tribute to the great god Disco notably less intense than the nonpareil Is It Still Good to Ya, it's notably less memorable than Send It, which offers three songs that beat anything here.

Hooked by their most confident and attractive single since 1978's ""Is It Still Good to Ya"" (and maybe since whenever), this never rises nearly so high again, but the nontitle side especially is a return to the consistency of So So Satisfied and Stay Free. Which is to say that these world-class songwriters have made themselves another groove album. But not to suggest the pertinent contradiction: the groove is a flow, the flow hips and hops.

Nearly two hours of 1997-99 cassette-only rarely peak and never drag. A battle rapper already touching on the conscience-stricken sexual and relationship issues that would move shysters to slot him emo, Slug is so excited to discover how much rhyme he has in him that his creative optimism revs Ant's subtle tracks.

Rapper Slug and beatmaster Ant both change direction on this classy package (a bound book--download that, suckers). Ant's shift is less auspicious: no samples. But the ""Shoulda Known"" synth groan is his catchiest hook in years, and most of the music he coaxes out of his Twin Cities g-s-d-etc. cohort is distinguished enough, especially given his partner's progress. Slug has always made more of self-examination than most cult celebs who work that shtick, and he shows them how on tracks like the well-named ""Me."" But he's even sharper empathizing with smaller-time losers. True, two of his angst victims are waitresses, the club-circuit version of the cab drivers who've been giving journalists man-on-the-street copy for generations--how about slaves of telemarketing, or data entry? Nevertheless, the lost lives and loves he sketches are so painfully familiar they feel like truth. And Ant's homey beats enhance the illusion.

For months I struggled to get with the commendable postpunk feminism and accessible quasifunk rock and roll of this gender-balanced quartet, and for months I failed. Only in person did I notice that gender symbol Lesley Woods had about as much to say now as Grace Slick did in 1967--more than you'd predict and less than you'd hope--and that on the whole they sounded like a bored Gang of Four. Dozed off during the climactic ""It's Obvious."" Which I found rousing anyway. Ditto for the album when I got home.

Given the putrefaction potential of the straightforwardly literary romanticism Roddy Frame affects, it's amazing he did so brilliantly with it even once. In fact, it's fairly amazing that second time out he gets away with it three songs' worth--three songs whose verbal lyricism sharpens the consistently winsome music, which is the kind of unlikely feat critics expect of straightforwardly literary types. Silly though it seems, Frame may be right to worry that his youth is passing at twenty-one, unless you want to blame the five merely winsome songs on producer Mark Knopfler, who probably thought ""Here lies the essence of my peers"" a deep line and certainly cheered ""Knife"" on to nine minutes.

So though this sounds like, gee, a Tricky record, it's more grooveful and also more playful, catering to the theoretical paying customers however private it must be. Even for us Tricky fans, these intimations of vitality are a relief. Note, however, that one of unk's three consecutive guest tracks provides the album's title and its peak.

In the end, though, I prefer their first, when the inspiration was fresh.

Mediocre hardcore you can ignore, especially if you live in an area where they dig up the street a lot; hardcore of a certain quality you love or hate. More than ex-fusioneer Dr. Know on ""gits,"" it's the distinctive if not exactly authoritative blackboard-screechy ""throat"" of H.R. that provides the quality here, and I like it, kind of.

Like a good rapper, Greg Graffin is once again singing his own tune--no matter how the three chords play themselves out on the (probably nonexistent, but never mind) lead sheet, the natural drone of his voice adds a music of its own. And he's still finding naive new truths in disillusioned hardcore truisms. ""Culture was the seed of proliferation but it has gotten melded into an inharmonic whole"" is bad writing; so's ""Prescience was not lacking and the present was not all."" Yet propelled by the drone and the three chords, they clobber you with the life-probe that's always been rock and roll's secret, excuse, or reason for being.

Pretty convoluted: great falsetto of great drummer-led black pop band seeks solo identity, turns for production aid (and duet on single) to drummer who's led great (i.e., best-selling) white art-rock band back into money by ripping off (appropriating?) black rhythms and vocals. Funny thing is: though Phil Collins plays a little louder than Maurice White, he's got almost as many chops and may even sing better.

In a time when the only black people with the guts to go for the soul are Mississippi recidivists and moldy oldies, this L.A. sophisticate has the audacity to pretend she can make pop music out of the shit.

He's an Austin-based singer-songwriter who'll be coming back for the rest of his life from near-death in a 1986 Shining Path bombing. Deafer than not, he also relearned guitar with his left hand, so it would be presumptuous in the extreme to dismiss his quiet, putatively unfinished music as any kind of affectation--John Prine imitator, some might say. Around the middle, the mercy here risks bathos because the sad mood is so unvarying, but soon it rights itself. My two favorites honor marriages, one ended in its natural time by death, the other saved before it's too late by near-death. I also recommend the quiet antiwar tract where the husband gets a kiss for bringing his wife a Coke at the Little League game. And the one about Peru.

London postfeminists who appropriate girl-group epiphenomena affectlessly, to signify inauthenticity, they fare better with odious Stock Aitken Waterman synthpop than with the shallow Swain &amp; Jolley synthsoul they started out with--where Leee Johns sounded dreamy wafting through that detached mix, these lucky lasses just seemed untouchably dreamlike. It's some kind of camp achievement that like the totally plastic singles group they play at being, they're equal to their most ""meaningful"" early material nevertheless, and some kind of camp limitation that their rilly greatest hits are ""Venus"" and ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.""

I've gone both ways with this group--if Music from Big Pink didn't tempt me away from my urban fastness, The Band did manage to make me jump around in my apartment. What gets in the way of this follow-up, however, is neither natural alienation nor critical overanticipation--it's the music itself, which simply overmatches the words. The tunes are so bright and doughty, and the musicians pitch in with so much will, that the domestic banalities of side one seem out of place in a way those of Delaney &amp; Bonnie, say, never do. And if the settings are too complex for what Robbie Robertson knows, they're too unfocused for what he doesn't know, as the confused politico-philosophical grapplings on side two make agonizingly clear. Memorable as most of these songs are, they never hook in--never give up the musical-verbal phrase that might encapsulate their every-which-way power. Which perhaps means that they don't have much to say.

I've always been put off by the sprung quality of the Band's music--the sense that if someone were to undo the catch its works would be propelled forth in all directions. Instead of energizing the impulse to piece together the lyrics--in the manner of the Stones, not to mention Bob Dylan--the sound of albums like Music From Big Pink and Stage Fright (though not The Band or The Basement Tapes) tends to reinforce their own metaphorical impenetrability. So the pure comeliness of every melody on this album led to an immediate infatuation. As I listened to the words, however, infatuation turned to mild affection, for the best of these songs is sentimental, and the worst (the two that are set in the city) are grossly sentimental. Only Garth Hudson, who has turned into a synthesizer natural, saves things in the end, and just barely.

The movie improves when you can't see it--Robbie Robertson and friends don't play anywhere near as smug as they look (or talk). And for an olio featuring eleven guest vocalists and a studio ""suite,"" the soundtrack is remarkably coherent. The four new Band tunes are nothing special, but everybody lays into the oldies. The blues sequence--beefed up by Toussaint's horns, Butterfield's harp, Muddy's pipes, and a blistering if messy Robertson-Clapton duet--is a small landmark, Morrison and Young are worth going back to, and Dylan's ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down"" is spunky enough to make up for ""Forever Young."" Not only that, Joni Mitchell and Neil Diamond are on the same side. Bet this ages a lot better than Woodstock--in a way, it already has.

Only a grinch would deny the intrinsic entertainment value of this significant-by-definition package. For one thing, these are the first known radio tapes where the talk is more precious than the music--in addition to everything else, they were the funniest rock stars ever. A few of the covers--""A Shot of Rhythm and Blues,"" ""Soldier of Love,"" ""Lucille,"" and a ""Baby It's You"" that proves once and for all that John was the cute one--are among their greatest. But a number of the more obscure songs (Ann-Margret? the Jodimars?) never reached vinyl for the simple reason that they were too lame, and I bet most of the seven Chuck Berrys were vetoed for redundancy. What's more, these drop-in sessions give off none of the adrenaline rush of the screaming meemies at the Hollywood Bowl or the amphetamine intensity that breaks out of the dim Hamburg tapes--the audience is missing, and no one else is powerful enough to take its place. So in the end the chief historical beneficiary is George Martin, who may just have driven his lads to heights they were too relaxed to scale on their own.

Just a few years ago Paul Heaton impressed with his empathy for his elders. Two albums later the song that turns on gray hairs seems to be about him. He's not close to losing his gift and may never be; pros like him have a right to their ups and downs, and after the soggy Quench, his music man Paul Rotheray has aired it out some. I dare the callowest Blur fan to resist the three-note piano-then-guitar-then-bass rhythm figure that anchors ""10,000 Feet,"" sure to be a single with B sides before this 19-cut there, 17-cut here release finishes its U.K. run. But Blur are younger than the Beautiful South, always will be, and now they're on Anglophilia's slippery slope themselves. Americans are so insensitive.

On the recordings of Paul Berliner and elsewhere I've always found the African thumb piano--mbira, kalimba, sanza--overly delicate, fragile as a music box. These experimental compositions, by a Camerounian musicologist who calls on a wide range of supplementary African instruments and techniques, are lithe and lovely. And when Bebey breaks into his subguttural chest voice you won't know whether to gasp or giggle.

The absurdist neofolkie as goofball abuser, most strikingly in (""ironic""?) rural guise--hick hermit, acoustic bluesman, wallower in honky-tonk lamentation. Satan, tacos, and aphids make multiple appearances, as does a crazy alien's unnatural falsetto. Cultish, and less than the sum of its inconsistent parts. But the offhand dazzle of these odds and sods is the stuff cults are made of.

Because he's also the poster child of '90s irony, which morphed so neatly into the passivity '00s alt-rockers pit against evil, the poster child of information overload doesn't quite get down to cases here. But unlike Guero this one really has some war in it--makes ""a kick drum sound like an SOS"" and turns a homeless woman into a soldier in Iraq. The best song addresses a chronic problem clearly for once: ""I think I'm in love and it makes me kind of nervous to say so."" ""Dark Star"" despairs so resolutely it could make a dead man grateful.

At first I was put off by the commercial desperation that induced these chronic fatuosos to turn out their brightest album in many years. But commercial success validated it: ""Nights on Broadway"" and ""Jive Talkin'"" turned out to be the kind of fluff that sticks. Sad to say, an unpleasant tension between feigned soulfulness and transparent insincerity still mars most of side two, which does, however, lead off with an undiscovered gem: ""All This Making Love,"" a baroque, frantically mechanical evocation of compulsive sex.

Play Boban Markovic or Kocani Orkestar and you hear contained chaos and wild drums. Play Beirut, most of it multitracked by young Zach Condon working alone, and you hear irrepressible melodicism tempered by harmonic melancholy. Rather than a watering down, this mildness is a d������������������tournement, the personal stamp of a romantic caught twixt Keats and Ossian--half prodigy, half bullshit artist. He might even bring off the Buckley-Wainwright-Yorke vocalisms if he minded his words instead of melismating croons and moans. But only""What can you do when curtain falls/What will you do when curtain falls/You're left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right"" (the Balkans, fucked coming and going) and ""The times we had/Oh, when the wind would blow and rain would snow/Were not all bad/We put our feet just where they had to go"" (the sorrows of young Zachary).

Whatever its pretensions, all country music offers the same primary reward: tuneful variations on the verities of the ordinary. These harmonizing eclectics sometimes outdo themselves. The rueful, nostalgic ""Old Hippie"" is Nashville's own ""Born in the U.S.A.""--""He ain't tryin' to change nobody/He's just tryin' to adjust""--and ""Lie to You for Your Love"" is a generic paradox that puts their strong weakness for ass-man smarm in perspective.

Graham Brown to whoo-ee Waylon Jennings, these harmonizing eclectics were as good as I could find. Which ain't great and never has been, but will do. No matter its pretensions, all country music has the same primary reward: tuneful variations on the verities of the ordinary. The second side, which proceeds from a Marshall Crenshaw cover to the generic paradox of ""I Would Lie for Your Love"" to the rueful ""Old Hippie"" to filler, is exemplary.

Because the new jack thing is supposed to be a ""pop"" move, softening rap's male-bonded ""rock"" ethos with sweet beats and romantic lies, their misogyny is more alarming than usual. Scared shitless of how much they need the one thing on their minds, they dis the girls who give it to them. ""I had to prove my manhood/Show her that the B-I-V was damn good,"" but he's sure it isn't just him who makes her hot: ""She's like that every day."" You might say they'd have a shot at a decent sex life if they'd stop obsessing on every ""sexy X-rated video queen."" But that's the symptom, not the cure--a cure the slick, juicy polyrhythms of Dr. Freeze and the Shocklee-Sadler crew make me wish they'd find. Sure it's possible they're just shaking off their New Edition image. It's also possible they're mean bastards.

I'm agnostic at best as regards the urban legend of Bennett's ageless cool. It's too classy on his end and too voguish on that of his eager young admirers. But this guy isn't just 80--he's 88, old enough to awaken in a 72-year-old like myself something approaching the dreams of immortality he instills his thirtysomething partisans. Granted, it's his twentysomething partner who provides the elan vital here. Gaga grabs these standards as Linda Ronstadt never did and Annie Lennox should be tried for trying--rock-'em sock-'em uptempo, not quite overripe on ballads, and having a ball both ways. In a true collaboration--both solo turns fall flat--it's her enthusiasm, her vulgarity, and the liberties she takes with the tunes that make the concept sing. That said, however, Bennett always sounds like he has some left in the tank. It's inspirational, I admit.

In a lot of ways this is a perfect record--easy studio funk unmarred by a single error of commission. Benno does Boz Scaggs a lot looser and happier than Boz Scaggs has for a while, and Bobby Keys stands out among the sidemen (Radle, Keltner, Utley) only because he's never sounded better. It's divided into a irresistible dance side and a decent enough listening side. Yet I no longer trust such basically unthinking supercompetence to provide lasting pleasure. Anyone who doesn't share my reservations should probably buy this, and even if you do--well, I keep playing it.

Roughing his velvet voice with just the slightest hint of alluvial mud as Clyde Otis's strings swooped and punched, Benton was rock and roll's answer to Nat King Cole or black music's answer to Pat Boone. Either way he filled a need, and he wrote most of his own tunes, too. Though this selection from his 22 r&amp;b hits (among them two unincluded number one Dinah Washington duets) is skimpier than there's any reason for, I'll take him over Lou Rawls anyday.

If Laurie Anderson's a musician, so's this conceptualist. Her band includes Ivan Julian and Adele Bertei, and she needs 'em: she credits composers on 11 of 12 cuts, including the boite medley (thank God for cabaret, it lets you stay in New York and enjoy your co-op), the Prince cover (for Sheila E., Apollonia, Vanity, Wendy, and Lisa), and ""The Women of Rock 'n' Roll"" (the story of her magic night with Stevie Nicks, who hasn't called in six months).

Well I'll be. The inventor of rock and roll hasn't made an album this listenable in fifteen years--no great new songs, but he's never written better throwaways (or covered ""Ozymandias,"" either). Both Berry and Johnny Johnson--the piano half of his sound for a quarter of a century--have tricked up their styles without vitiating or cheapening them, and the result is a groove for all decades. Minor for sure, but what a surprise.

This wasn't the great Chuck Berry concert if only because his voice is half shot--all those cracks don't ruin the fun, but they don't expose unexpected nuances in it either. Though Julian Lennon and Linda Ronstadt are less obtrusive when you can't see them trying to look like they belong, most of the cameos are still only adequate-to-embarrassing: the sole triumph is Eric Clapton's ""Wee Wee Hours,"" with a typically miraculous solo from the omnipresent Johnnie Johnson. And so what? It's still the best live album the man ever made. I mean, what do you want?

Like most Gypsy outfits, these Hungarians work weddings, which involves pleasing many ethnic subgroupings--subber than the ""Albanian, Greek, Serbian, Macedonian, and Turkish"" cited in the notes--and complement many moods. Some of these moods are kind of moody, and the players like to show off their chops and their respect for propriety.

The chirpy opener about fun in the sun is a feint--the lyrics that follow are so depressive that the consistent cheer and conservatism of the tunes is like some perverse minimalist art move. Problem is, nothing in Beth Cosentino's self-inflicted boy problems and palpable longing for a childhood when she didn't have to deal with them suggests that she's got the guts for such a concept. Melodically and verbally, her clarity is a gift. But until she bucks up and tells that jerk to take a hike, it's not going to do her much good. Nobody loves a doormat.

I keep waiting for number two to come through on the dance floor the way the debut did, but ""Party out of Bounds"" and ""Quiche Lorraine"" are expert entertainments at best and the wacko parochialism of ""Private Idaho"" is a positive annoyance.

Sorry, but my fond belief in Kate &amp; Cindy as postmodern girl duo has just gone the way of my fond hopes for Joan and Chrissie as rock and roll future. Except for the postfeminist ""Housework,"" they contribute watercolors posing as Kenny Scharfs--not only don't ""Summer of Love"" and ""She Brakes for Rainbows"" redeem anybody's '60s retro, they don't even take off on it. So Fred's abrasive camp saves the day, and talk about satiric justice--he gets off a credible nudist anthem, a credible psychedelic fantasy, and (get this) a credible ecology song in the process.

In the end, their made-in-U.K. breakthrough attempt is a catchy, unconventional pop record--not only is the song for war-dead children about kids they knew, but you can be sure it doesn't suggest the war was unnecessary. But that's all it is. Ingratiation is so ingrained in these former freedom fighters that they're almost swallowed by former Sade producer Robin Millar, who goes for pan-Africana with quasi-Zairean horns and transforms subtle cross-rhythms into upfront hooks. Rewriting ""Skokiaan"" as ""Happy Birthday"" because they know ""Happy happy Africa"" won't wash anymore, structuring ""Rugare"" (""work hard and reap the fruits of your labour"") around schlocko synth chords and bridges that go nowhere, they're victims of crossover, compromising and accommodating when they should be expanding and appropriating. And they're still not half-bad.

Though they don't want you to know it, these hateful little twerps are sensitive souls--they're moved to make this godawful racket by the godawful pain of the world, which they learn about reading everything from textbooks to bondage mags.

Postpunks should forget Janis Joplin and dig this: just because they practiced in their own $300-a-month Marin commune doesn't mean they weren't a garage band.

""I ain't rap about dope nor do I sell it,"" raps a Mississippi ""country boy"" who's more mixed about pimping--maybe unreadable, maybe of two minds, maybe blurring the pimp sound and the pimp hustle. The sound he's definitely got down: a rich, comfortable funk he transports south from Willie Hutch's The Mack. And as befits someone who believes N.I.G.G.E.R. stands for ""Naive Individual Glorifying Greed and Encouraging Racism"" and gets life satisfaction from rotating his tires, his sound equals his hustle. Some may think his rhymes are too simple. I find ""Some thangs are forever, nothin' ever last/Like the risin' of the sun or when Big Mama pass"" pretty deep myself.

And without benefit of a ""Crack Attack"" or ""Shoot the President,"" here's 10 inches of ugly introduction to their politically incorrect punk-industrial. The guy processes his voice down deep and then talk-sings like a demented trucker, drag racer, or metal animal, leaving a sexy Kim Gordon tribute/parody to the gal, who also shines in groupie and waitress cameos.

Disrupting her delicate, speechlike soprano with unpredictable guitar comps acoustic and electric, Adrianne Lanker and her guys mean to prove that women needn't be loud to be strong and men needn't be needy. As the explicitly heterosexual opener puts it: ""There's a woman inside of me / There's one inside of you, too."" Admittedly if not proudly best suited to headphones or computer speakers, the band is subtle, arty, obscure--you know ""Great White Shark"" references an automobile accident only because Lanker said so in an interview, and ""Watering"" attenuates the brutality of sexual assault with imagery so sensationalistic it's abstract.

Seeing Youth live gave me new insight into why they call it toasting--he's a toastmaster, a Rastafarian George Jessel, complete with carry-a-tune crooning, name-dropping tributes, and shuffle-off-to-Babylon stage routines. All of which were wonderful--the enthusiasm was that unmediated. His evolution into a roots Mr. Entertainment has changed his records, which now include songs. Not great songs, either, as I would say. But ""Get On Up"" is a great chant, ""Bang Dibo"" a great goof, ""Many Moods of Big Youth"" a great m���""We Can Work It Out"" a great cover (by anybody).

But since Lester was a genius, I have to mention that it's manifestly more confident than 1981's perfectly acceptable Jook Savages on the Brazos, with which it shares four songs, preserved for posterity a second time after the singer had the opportunity to develop some mannerisms. He was better off relying on force of personality--musically he always had the instincts, and words were no problem.

After singing (and playing) the blues for ten years, Elvin makes like he was born to boogie. Completing his Marin-to-Macon switch by recording at Criteria in Miami instead of the Record Plant in Sausalito, he here provides Capricorn with enough hooks to keep the Brothers gone fishin for the next decade. All very debrained, of course, but the first side never stops, and if the title cut isn't the label's first top-ten song since ""Ramblin' Man,"" either my name ain't Juke Box Johnny or ""Fooled Around and Fell in Love"" got there first.

Bishop is a road musician. He doesn't knock himself out making Great Albums, but he doesn't get all twisted up racing after Breakthrough Hits, either. He doesn't even Promote Product much--on tour, he mentioned this LP only when he did a song from it, which happened once.

After six more years of Thatcher and the dawning of electrohop, it's as if Linx had laminated the soft edges of its prophetic premeditated funk to a flash, beatwise sheen. Both vocals and politics are more strident, pausing for love only to flog the jezebel whose lust for diamonds ends in the murder of an innocent jeweler by an innocent (sez they) black Briton.

This hasn't made itself felt the way Red did for fairly marginal reasons, hype/timing not least among them--the need for a new Marley becomes less urgent as the self-evident truth that there ain't gonna be one is absorbed.

The (translated) lyrics are intelligently romantic (with an Indian smuggler smuggled in), and after the usual unusual effort, I can report that the tunes are solid, the grooves Latino, and the vocals proof of a major pop intelligence--he's revamped the floridity of an entire tradition in the image of his own physical limitations. Can you dance to it? Better than me, I'm sure.

On their second try, producer Steve Barri and arranger Michael Omartian pull out the pop stops, and while the result isn't too long on conviction it does have its own ersatz character. Refabricated intros worthy of Three Dog Night, prefabricated songs worthy of Bobby Bland, and a woman named Yolanda who leaves Bobby ""in this wilderness with no money down""--the wilderness being Charlestown, South Carolina, and Yolanda's Pygmalion being the same guy who wrote ""My Maria"" and ""Shambala.""

Despite the funky title, this is Bland's country album, and while it won't turn him into Ray Charles, it's a modest success--he gets more suitable (even funky) arrangements form Nashvillians Don Gant and Ron Chancey than Charles gets from Sid Feller. On side one he sounds completely at (or down) home stealing songs from Merle Haggard and Charlie Rich. Overdisc he seems a little ill at ease reassuring a virgin with bom-bom-boms, but wouldn't you?

One of two bands cited as proof that L.A. punks aren't just bigots with mohawks (the other, the Go-Go's, has--gulp!--girls in it), these rock and rollers don't quite fit their rockabilly revivalist pigeonhole. Where the average Whitecat is so pencil-necked he can hardly hold up an acoustic bass, they have muscles, and where the average Rockin' Ronnie Weiser signing is a barely literate has-been who never really was, they have brains and potential. Or so songs like ""Barn Burning"" and, believe it or not, ""American Music"" lead one to believe. They do get that chickenshit Scotty Moore guitar sound right, though. With Ronnie at the boards, they don't have much choice.

FALSE,B+,Dinner Music,Carla Bley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=544,"
I'm quite taken with this, which reminds me in an abstract way of Another Green World. Where dance jazz was unselfconsciously functional, this is art jazz that was designed to be functional--just as Eno designed his electronic pop-rock to fade into the background the way so much electronic pop-rock does anyway. The result is yet another of those Jazz Composer's Orchestra get-togethers between avant-gardists (JCOA stalwarts Michael Mantler and Roswell Rudd) and pop luminaries (the Stuff studio funk axis), and this time the music meshes. Unfortunately, however, I find that only two of the right cuts--""Ida Lupino"" and ""Ad Infinitum""--combine melody and rigor as magically as the double-edged concept promises.

Ahh, New York. I remember Debbie Blondie when she was singing with nursery-rhyme breathiness for a group called the Wind in the Willows. Now she sounds flatly cynical against a very funny aural montage of girl-group and original-punk usages from the prepsychedelic era--less blithe, certainly, but more, you know, together. Which is what new-punk posturing is all about. Special award: best use of trash organ since ""Light My Fire.""

Side one is everything this band is supposed to be--seven fresh, clever, evanescent songs, each with its own hip twist. Whether Deborah Harry is claiming that using telepathy to win at poker is ""really not cheating"" or executing a siren call for the electric age (the bell she imitates sounds like it belongs on a squad car), her vocals are on top and out front, a pop-rock delight. But side two bombs, except for ""Kidnapper"" and a couple of refrains, and the singing gets lost in the mud. Me, I'd buy it for side one. But I'm not sure about you.

Reggae from a multilingual Ivory Coast star who puts message up front, this probably wouldn't get over on words even if you understood Mandingue or Dioula--in French and English, the politics are naive and toothless. As usual in West African pop, the voice is too mild, and as usual in West African reggae, the rhythm section is too buoyant. But glancing off such dance tunes as ""Idjidja"" and ""Kiti"" and, yes, ""Come Back Jesus"" (not to mention the base-covering ""S�����""), the singing completes an eloquently transatlantic groove--Afropop dread, a fast-flowing stream whose depth can't be fathomed. This achievement is also very West African.

There's something suspect about this ex-Manhattanite turned parttime Parisian and his multilingual Islamic reggae from Abidjan--he's a third-world marketer's dream even if he's marketing himself. But at worst he puts out a finer grade of generic Wailers than Rita's ever going to front, and three cuts sound like acts of genius rather than strokes of luck: the otherwise Francophone ""Kalachnikov Love,"" whatever that means (and I want to know); ""Jerusalem,"" slipping with a sly presumption of innocence from basic English to pidgin Hebrew, pidgin Arabic, and pidgin French; and ""Travailler C'Est Trop Dur,"" which breaks his loping skank into a pretty gallop. After all, there's something suspect about Prince, too.

Four arresting pieces of intelligent funk-lite set up six merely accomplished pieces of intelligent funk-lite before Dev Hynes's virtuosity saves the day. The transvestite subway trip ""Uncle ACE"" turns focus track when its distressed harmonics bloom into a saxish finale-turned-fade, with David Longstreth's pained shtick right after augmenting the mood. But despite the added charge of two surprise raps whose ordinary male sexism and striving accentuate Hynes's doomed sweetness, too much vocal space is tendered the pretty, vacant Samantha Urbani. Only when the auteur's piano saturates the climactic ""Time Will Tell"" does his vision of romance in perpetual suspended animation regain the poignancy he's so convinced it's worth.

Ramones fans will claim his first-beat sledgehammer is monotonous; I enjoy its simplicity just like I do the Ramones'. Not as much, I admit--""All I Want in the World (Is to Find That Girl)"" would be a retarded change of pace even if Kurtis talked it, and he doesn't. But though it bodes ill for both his rhythms and his politics, the bare competence of his Bachman-Turner Overdrive cover has special charm, and his hit metapun is a true breakthrough.

The best Stylistics album since Round Two is a Philly Phormalist's delight. Produced by Gamble-Huff veteran Norman Harris, it features the velvety falsetto of Ted White and four hit singles (only one of which, the Tod Browning tribute ""Sideshow,"" has broken pop). What's more, the filler includes a seven-minute ""Just Don't Want to Be Lonely"" that helps me understand why Ronnie Dyson and the Main Ingredient both cut the song, though not why anybody bought it when they did.

Warning: critics' band, managed by Sandy Pearlman with occasional lyrics by R. Meltzer. Reassurance: the most musical hard rock album since Who's Next. (Well, that's less than six months, and this is not a great time for hard rock albums.) The style is technocratic psychedelic, a distanced, decisively post-Altamont reworking of the hallucinogenic guitar patterns of yore, with lots of heavy trappings. Not that they don't have a lyrical side. In ""Then Came the Last Days of May,"" for instance, four young men ride out to seek their fortune in the dope biz and one makes his by wasting the other three.

Says S. Pearlman: ""We want to be disgusting, not trans-repulsive."" Says R. Meltzer: ""This is really hard rock comedy."" Musically, Long Island's only underground band impales the entire heavy ethos on a finely-honed guitar neck, often at high speed, which is the punch line. And the lyrics aren't inaudible, just unbelievable--a parody-surreal refraction of the abysmal ""poetry"" of heavy, with its evil women and gods of hellfire. Which is not to suggest that it doesn't become what it takes off from. But is that bad or good?

Just when I figured they were doomed to repeat themselves until the breakup, they come up with the Fleetwood Mac of heavy metal, not as fast as Tyranny and Mutation but longer on momentum, with MOR tongue-in-cheek replacing the black-leather posturing and future games.

If John Fogerty really wants to play all the instruments, he's wise to perform country music, because overdubbing on top of yourself is a good way to get the kind of semimechanical feel Nashville producers strive for. Although the energy rushes here (one guitar break on ""Jambalaya,"" the no-no-nos on ""Heart of Stone"") are almost as rare as the new songs, the voice sounds more original than ever: Fogerty may not be Jimmie Rodgers, but he makes a damn fine Lefty Frizzell.

Indifferent to concepts like ""content"" and ""originality,"" this casual dance-hit rip cycles (and recycles) about three basic riffs and some raucous yowsah-yowsah into an album that divides into irresistibly inspired A side and delightfully tossed-off B as surely as any New Orleans novelty or rockabilly romp.

Although these casually lapidary popsongs sounded slight as singles, they gain authority laid down seven or eight to a side. But for all their jumpy originality they're still slight, and Richard Barrone's lyrics are so oblique you have to wonder what his angle is. Growing up isn't that confusing--or that personal.

Though one's moralistic quibbles do recede as history demonstrates how much worse things can get and how little music has to do with it, KRS-One's talk of fucking virgins and blowing brains out will never make him my B-boy of the first resort. I could do without the turf war, too--from the Lower East Side, not to mention Kingston or Kinshasa (or Podunk), Queens and the South Bronx are both def enough. But his mind is complex and exemplary--he's sharp and articulate, his idealism more than a gang-code and his confusion profound. And Scott LaRock was a genius. Sampling blues metal as well as James Brown, spinning grooves to toast by, blind-siding the beat with grunts and telephones and dim backtalk, he was spare and rich simultaneously. Music will miss him more than Jaco Pastorius and Will Shatter put together.

FALSE,B+,By All Means Necessary,Boogie Down Productions,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=414,"
Deprived of the great murdered beatmaster Scott LaRock, KRS-One is reduced to a stark minimalism that matches his mood: still brandishing his piece on the cover, he's as serious as Jesse inside, occasionally pretentious but never full of himself. He criticizes the self-proclaimed kings of a scene too democratic to support royalty and the self-proclaimed godfathers of a scene too young to have an old school, identifies tribalism as the white man's game, and comes out strong for peace through strength. Only ""Jimmy"" is much fun, and ""Jimmy"" is a condom commercial. But at his best--""Stop the Violence,"" which might conceivably catch black radio in a community-spirited moment of weakness--he's as complex and cold-eyed as the kings themselves, with two extras: he's not middle-class and he's on a mission.

KRS-One isn't just serious, he aspires to sainthood, and tough noogs if you think that makes him ""boring"" or ""pretentious"" or any of that racist, anti-intellectual cant--he comes so close that the whole of the record is greater than the minimalism of its blueprint stylee. Austerely sampled or all the way live, the music per se is almost hookless and swingless. But the dubwise skank of his natural groove carries his rhymes when the rhymes themselves don't capture the consciousness like a good hook should. Though I wish he didn't feel compelled to argue what color Moses was, his fundamental conceit--a peace harder than violence--is visionary. And when he takes no shit from the police, I say amen.

This is palpably more strident. The Longhair medley just isn't as sly and delicate as it should be, and in general there's too much reliance on the left hand, with the consequent loss of dynamic subtlety compounded by a klutzy drum mix. But except on his unintentional travesty of ""King of the Road,"" Booker's forthright way with songs like ""All Around the World"" and ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"" and even ""Hound Dog"" has a barroom feel missing from the live disc. And the glorious schmaltz of ""Swedish Rhapsody"" was intended by an artist with a passion for camp.

As the clash of punk guitars battled the swelling Springsteen-cum-Lizzy pseudoclimaxes, I began to suspect a fix, especially since record-bizzers have been heard to murmur fondly about the ""musical"" skill of these up-and-coming Irish nasties. But throughout a first side that often shifts mood but never quits, this is the real stuff, banging home the survival value of a brain unclogged by useless feelings. Unfortunately, side two bogs down in evocations of misogyny, boredom, and the plight of the young, all surrounding an apparent throwaway called ""Close as You'll Ever Be"" that ought to be a single.

Satisfied owners of the group's Mercury debut might spring for the import (on Ensign), since this repeats two of the better tunes from that new wave no-sale. And seekers after straight-ahead cacophony might look around for the Mercury. But though this does turn rather campy at times--Bob Geldof's cheerfully narsty opportunism has lost body and focus--it will certainly do. I'll take a good calculating song about Adolf Hitler over an ordinary calculating song about the perils of romance any day, and if you're heading your music toward the rock mainstream, wit and flash don't hurt.

Yes indeed, the man can sing, though given that he made his name as a musician and writer I'm equally gratified he can rap. Competently in both cases. The difference comes in what he sings or raps.

Though the Rubber Band was the only P-Funk spinoff to sell through, distinguishing it from the parent organization quickly became problematic. Conceived partly as bait for Warner Bros., it did serve the special interests of subteen Geepies for a while, not to mention the special interests of Bootsy, certainly the most charismatic Funkateer save the Dr. himself, but before long Parliament was making kiddie moves and the Starman was fizzling. So on the one hand this is a welcome return to form, and on the other it's interim P-Funk--from the ""Shortnin' Bread"" intro through the ""unenjoyment line"" protest through the jump blues tribute all the way to the climactic ""Sound Crack,"" which after several dead-end tangents returns all space travelers to the ineluctable One.

When I think about it, I like the joke, too. So how come I'm not fucking, dancing, or laughing? Well, I suspect it ahs more to do with not being eleven than with not being black, and more to do with my funnybone than my booty.

These righteous Haitians are thought of as a pan-African party machine, but in the aural fact they're devotional. Well past their new flavor moment, they turn out to be one of those bands that develops its craft rather than one of those bands that hits you over the head with an idea they proceed to wear out. Something like soulful, drenched with synthesizers because synthesizers seem natural, their impassioned trance recalls Nyabinghi chants more than Holiness hymns, and is closely related to both.

Though there could be more flesh on the voice and more sass in the lyrics, Johnny Watson (with shades of Mose Allison, and, well, Blood Ulmer) isn't such a bad vocal model for a guitar player who wants to better himself. Nice Memphis Slim cover, too.

In its own way, this is audacious stuff right down to the stubborn wispiness of its sound, and Bowie's actorly intonations add humor and shades of meaning to the words. Which are often witty and rarely precious, offering an unusually candid and detailed vantage on the rock star's world. Admittedly, for a long time I wondered who cared, besides lost kids for whom such access feels like privilege.

The pubeless is-he-naked? illustration inside the doublefold suggests not bisexuality but asexuality--the affliction of a romantic for whom love turns nasty, awkward, and exploitative when touched by lust. So maybe the bleak future Bowie likes to scare his fans with is a metaphor for his own present, the American phase of which is reflected by these hardrocking mechanisms. But the cover, ""Let's Spend the Night Together,"" opens other possibilities: its lyric suggests an alternative to the brutality of ""Cracked Actor"" and its music can help you through the bitterest realities. As a result, this is more interesting thematically than Ziggy Stardust, and it's also better rock and roll.

I find side one's seven ""fragments""--since the two that clock in at less than 2:45 are 1:42 and 2:20, the term must refer to structures rather than length--almost as powerful as the ""overlong"" tracks on Station to Station. ""Such a wonderful person/But you got problems"" is definitely a love lyric for our time. But most of the movie music on side two is so far from hypnotic that I figure Bowie, rather than Eno, must deserve credit for it. I mean, is Eno really completely fascinated by banality?

When I first heard the Enofied instrumental textures on side two, as background music, they struck me as more complex than their counterparts on Low, and they are. Low now seems quite pop, slick and to the point even when the point is background noise; in fact, after I completed my comparison, I began to play it a lot. But what was interesting background on ""Heroes"" proved merely noteworthy as foreground, admirably rather than attractively ragged. Maybe after the next album I'll get the drift of this one.

If James Brown is the only rock and roller who deserves more than one concert album, then the Bowie to ban is David Live. Stage kicks off with some well-chosen Bowie oldies before moving into refreshingly one-dimensional versions of his best songs since 1975, including the key Eno collaborations, which were often oversubtle to begin with. For fans only, of course. I'm one.

No concepts, no stylistic excursions, no avant collaborations--this songbook may be the most conventional album he's ever put his name on. Vocally it can be hard to take--if ""Teenage Wildlife"" parodies his chanteur mode on purpose the joke's not worth the pain, and if you think Tom Verlaine can't sing, check out ""Kingdom Come""--though anyone vaguely interested has already made peace with that. Lyrically it's too facile as usual, though the one about Major Tom's jones gets me every time. And musically, it apotheosizes his checkered past, bringing you up short with a tune you'd forgotten you remembered or a sonic that scrunches your shoulders or a beat that keeps you on your feet when your coccyx is moaning sit down.

A find. Transcending its well-connected professional genre, the slightly distracted passion of Bramblett's singing combines with his oblique fusion of Southern boogie, studio country-rock, and Caribbean polyrhythms to take the edge of privilege off his philosophical fatalism. His music is too warm and funny to sound self-satisfied, and the way he collects images around an aphoristic catchphrase is too open-ended to sound smug. Start with side two.

It owes more lyrically to Gil Scott-Heron than to Barry White but evokes both and is candid to the point of wryness (and terseness) about using words primarily for musical color. I like the way the synthesized violins are timed and love the fanfare coda to ""Love,"" my favorite cut.

FALSE,B+,"New York, Fall 1974",Anthony Braxton,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11270,"
Braxton's music is classified as jazz because Braxton is a black saxophonist who often plays with jazzmen, but that hardly covers it. The feeling is closer to eccentricity than it is to spontaneity, and just as I was starting to dig the cerebral exercises on side two--one cut features new-music synthesizer minimalist Richard Teitelbaum--I noticed that even the wildest of the new-jazz james on side one was sounding cerebral. Don't get me wrong--my cerebrum really got a buzz on. But this is often a little stiff.

FALSE,B+,Breakfast Special,Breakfast Special,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6457,"
Where it survives as indigenous country music, bluegrass may well be a wondrous thing, but among citybilly archivists it only magnifies the usual folkie escapisms--purism and pastoral nostalgia--by encouraging mindless virtuosity. Which makes this virtuosic but eclectically streetwise record a small miracle that should delight anyone more spiritually attuned to the genre than a faithless wretch like me.

FALSE,B+,The Very Long Fuse,Breaking Circus,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4457,"
A guitar band with drum machine, as Chicago as Big Black or industrial dance music. Or maybe Big Black is industrial dance music. Well, this isn't--it's hard-edged rock and roll, more like Australia's Celibate Rifles than Britannia's identically configured Three Johns. In standard postpunk mode, the appeal is sound not sense--the good lyrics come in snatches at best. But the sound would never have caught my ear without the completely realized ""(Knife in the) Marathon,"" a dark tale of Olympic racism, or terrorism, or simple skulduggery.

FALSE,B+,"Lifted, or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground",Bright Eyes,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11726,"
Spewing his sprawls of lyric, melody, and instrumentation, Conor Oberst is the poster boy of the American Agony Association. Respect him as a co-equal and he'll drive you out of the room in nothing flat. Feel or indulge his suffering youth, however, and he'll kindle something like awe. This great leap forward, 13 songs lasting 73 minutes without benefit of extended groove, comes to a climactic halt with ""Let's Not Shit Ourselves (To Love and Be Loved),"" where his apology for a suicide attempt elicits his dad's Inspirational Retort: ""Child, I love you regardless and there is nothing you could do that would ever change this. I'm not angry. It happens. You just can't do it again.""

Any Jewish boy with glasses who makes his living doing Blind Willie McTell imitations had better remember his place. Hence, this key line: ""When I got up this morning I had Someone Else's Blues.""

So much more consumable than Jacob or Hublot, the food Bronson fixates on never gets fancier than heirloom tomatoes or seared Ahi tuna--no cross-hatched merganser breast with lychee infusion and truffle garnis for this fat guy. With crucial propulsion and more crucial fun from no-name Tommy Mas's unfashionably sampled, unfashionably funky beats, his gluttony humanizes hip-hop materialism at an economically accessible level. If only he didn't treat women as meat like thousands of hip-hop hungries before him, I might even play it for my favorite cook at dinnertime. Instead, the follow-up Well-Done trades in his homie Tommy on the more renowned and predictable Statik Selektah as it seeks revenge for the bad romance the fat guy had coming.

As previously and probably hereafter, I always eat up the food stuff and occasionally retch at the sex stuff, with the ""Thug Love Story 2012""/""Hookers at the Point"" pairing the test case. Sexist though both are, I'm a fan because like Ghostface's ""Wildflower"" they come down on the right side of that razor-thin exposure-exploitation dividing line. But where with Eminem's ""Kim"" I'll argue that case ad nauseum, here no one is obliged to differentiate between those tracks and the one where he makes the ""joke""-I-hope-he-claims about sharing a hooker with his three-year-old son--sometimes dumb is just evil, end of story. What nobody should try and deny is this album's accelerating momentum and unstinting silliness--not only does he call the itty-bitty that needs ""the surgery"" his ""pee-pee,"" he rhymes it with ""TV,"" ""CD,"" ""3-D,"" and ""Fiji."" Yummiest food-sex confluence: cunnilingus as razorback clams with bucatini.

Brooks apparently lives in a milieu so saturated with comedy that laughter itself seems redundant, perhaps even vulgar. All that matters is the idea of Funny. In just that sense, the album is very Funny. Fortunately, it is also good for a modicum of laughs. Reminiscent in tone of Are You on Something? by Ray D'Ariano, who is now a successful promo man at MCA, where he keeps everyone in the office in stitches.

Burdened by the responsibilities he believes come with success, Brooks leads with the first song in Nashville history to inveigh, however discreetly, against not just racism but homophobia. There's nothing as wicked as ""Papa Loved Mama,"" which didn't bat an eye when mama fucked around or papa ran her over with his truck. But ""Somewhere Other Than the Night,"" about sex on the farm, and ""Learning to Live Again,"" about a divorc������������������'s blind date, typify the smarts of a guy who knows not all suburbanites are as stupid as Michael Bolton believes.

A little heavy-handed (all right, a little more heavy-handed), with three rodeo songs and a big fat Irish anthem that won't be to everyone's taste (all right, your taste). Don't matter, because he's so far from the schlock phony he's taken for--so open-hearted, so extreme, so sui generis--that all but a couple of tracks do his thing even when he's protesting too much (which, all right, may be his thing). Cute trick: the two about marriage explain his weakness for bucking broncos.

FALSE,B+,Don't Be Cruel,Bobby Brown,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=364,"
It's the eternal fast one/slow one problem--when he states his prerogatives and tries to make the world dance he's irresistible, when he masks his motives and tries to make the tenderoni moan he's an obvious con. But he earns his prerogatives: the internal rhymes and voice-electrobeat patterning of the title track are so tricky they're hooky. And since I've never been much of an expert on tenderoni, I'm willing to suspend judgment on the half that leaves me unmoved.
"
FALSE,B+,One More for the Road,Charles Brown,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4461,"
This long overdue piece of record-making hits you with its craft and taste. Of course, you think. Brown's powers are undimmed since he topped the charts as a lounge singer forty years ago, so why shouldn't he sound just as fine in the studio today? And he does. With Billy Butler on guitar, his combo is at least as choice as the Three Blazers, and he has forty years of lounge classics to draw on--""One for My Baby,"" ""I Miss You So,"" ""Who Will the Next Fool Be,"" all right. There's only one problem: Brown is no Nat King Cole. His voice slips into the lugubrious so reflexively that at times you suspect clutch problems with the master reel, and it could just be that he's best appreciated over a highball--or else, like so many chart-toppers before him, in three-minute doses.

FALSE,B+,Bustin' Loose,Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6462,"
Toward the end of 1978, these D.C. journeymen got lucky and hit the discos with the title track, which was very funk-soul for that disco moment. The album that resulted is almost like a field recording--a completely unpretentious document of what sort of originals a modestly gifted funk-soul dance band might be doing in 1978. There's even a salsa. Very likable.
"
FALSE,B+,Atrocity Exhibition,Danny Brown,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16989,"
Brown has reached the point where success deadens more than it animates, conspicuous consumption turns trope turns bore, and copping to your ""downward spiral"" loses its pedagogical mojo. He's still plenty clever, but saying ""Some people say I think too much/I don't think they think enough"" only begins to prove it, and blaming his biochemistry as he keeps bitches on rotation is getting ""old,"" as one might say. What saves it more than ever is musicality. Not only does Brown add the voice of a thoughtful struggler to his squealing weirdo and caustic thug, he sees to it that the tracks permute and evolve into something that feels thought through. So when he dubs himself ""Coltrane on Soul Plane,"" Coltrane he earns, sort of. But I read where Soul Plane--never saw it, never will--was an unfunny hip-hop/blaxploitation parody of the already dumbass laff riot Airplane. Right, even bad jokes are better than going on about what a mess your life is. But they don't straighten it up.
"
FALSE,B+,Revolution of the Mind,James Brown,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6466,"
Ever the innovator, Brown here presents a live double-LP, ""Recorded Live at the Apollo Vol. III."" Good stuff, too--a consistent overview of his polyrhythm phase. But ""Sex Machine"" is sharper and ""Bewildered"" deeper on last year's live double. And with the medley on side three the tempo gets so hot that anybody but JB will have trouble dancing to it.
"
FALSE,B+,The Payback,James Brown,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6472,"
Because more is often more with JB, a studio double comprising eight long songs isn't necessarily a gyp. Especially when all the songs have new titles. Not only does most of this work as dance music, but two slow ones are actually sung. ""Time Is Running Out Fast,"" however, is a spectacularly inaccurate title for a horn-and-voice excursion that shambles on for 12:37.

FALSE,B+,Jam/1980's,James Brown,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6481,"
Free of the pretentious bluster that has marred so much of his work in the disco era, this is the groove album Brown has been announcing for years. He's finally learned how to relax his rhythms without diluting his essence, and the A side is simply and superbly what the title promises, though he may have the decade wrong. The B side is less of the same, and I bet no one who buys this record ever chooses to play it. I also bet they'd get dancing if they did.
"
FALSE,B+,James Brown . . . Live: Hot on the One,James Brown,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4463,"
Hard to believe almost ten years have passed since JB had the wherewithal to release a live double--not the new tunes, which he mostly skips for old stuff, but the commercial credibility. Hard to believe this one's so different--busier, relying on band and backup rather than the acuity of Brown's singing. Hard to believe it's so alive--until you play the damn thing, which only slackens to make room for the latest edition of ""Man's World.""

FALSE,B+,Nonstop!,James Brown,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4464,"
Titles like ""Popcorn 80's,"" ""Love 80's,"" ""Super Bull/Super Bad,"" ""I Go Crazy,"" signal a contract-fulfilling rehash, but this time he's rehashing the right stuff in the right way--the horn charts and rhythm arrangements are as tricky and on the one as in any newfangled funk you want to name. Most of the sweet ache has disappeared from ""I Go Crazy"" since 1960, and I'm not going to claim that the successfully renegotiated tempo makes up for it. But it is a consolation.
"
FALSE,B+,Bring It On,James Brown,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4465,"
The fast side is honorable and dispensable--great title riff plus filler, nothing anyone who owns some early-'70s JB is likely to need or even want, though neophytes will dance to it now. The slow side comprises the three strongest covers Brown's released since he stuck a classic ""Kansas City"" onto Everybody's Doin' the Hustle in 1975. He still approaches high notes with the caution of someone who's hoarse as indelibly as he's black and proud, but he's emoting like he wants you to believe ""Tennessee Waltz"" and ""For Your Precious Love"" and in between comes ""The Right Time,"" which isn't really slow at all and features a Brownette who approaches any kind of note as if she owns it.

His wailing purist intensity closer to Hank than to any of the proud Hank fans who made him a gamble worth taking, Brown damn near gets across on sound alone and damn near makes it. Just before you've had it with ""I'll Climb Any Mountain"" (guess what he'll swim any), you realize he was astute enough to expend one of his few decent tunes on it. But soon you also notice that the chorus of ""Every Now and Then,"" which you went along with because it was fast, does actually go: ""Like a thief in the night/It cuts like a knife."" Imagine Hank without hits. Pray Brown gets the knack, or buys himself a few.

FALSE,B+,Running on Empty,Jackson Browne,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6491,"
Out of the studio--this was recorded on tour--Jackson sounds relaxed verbally, vocally, even instrumentally. He cuts his own meager melodies with nice ones by Danny O'Keefe and Danny Kortchmar. He does a funny and far from uncritical version of ""Cocaine"" and a loving and far from unfunny version of ""Stay."" I consider this his most attractive album. But his devotees may consider the self-effacement a deprivation.

FALSE,B+,Time Out,The Dave Brubeck Quartet,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15837,"
Inspired by a State Department-backed Eurasian tour and released in 1959, Brubeck's all-time bestseller is supposedly where he and drummer Joe Morello explore exotic Oriental time signatures, although near as most of us can tell it's got a lot of waltzes whether they're in 3/4 or 6/4. The big exceptions are the two classics: Brubeck's ""Blue Rondo A La Turk,"" in 9/8 even though it's a (bluesy) rondo, a sonatalike form invented by the exotic French, and Desmond's ""Take Five,"" in 5/4, steadied by a stubborn Brubeck vamp and covered wherever folks were cool: Stan Getz, Chet Atkins, Grover Washington, Rodrigo y Gabriela. While some say Morello doesn't swing enough, he's an inventive colorist, and as waltzes go, most of the remaining originals combine composition and propulsion with crowd-pleasing panache.

FALSE,B+,Things We Like,Jack Bruce,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6492,"
Recorded in Cream's heyday with John McLaughlin on guitar, Jon Hiseman on drums, and Dick Heckstall-Smith on saxophones, this has zip to do with rock or ""jazz-rock""--it's an enjoyable contemporary jazz LP that owes more to Ornette Coleman and to bebop than to the simplistic modalism favored by most rockers. McLaughlin would be a find if Miles Davis hadn't found him in the meantime, and Bruce's playing is deft when it's solid and contained when it's stormy. His compositions are less notable--only ""Hckhh Blues"" stands up next to the tune borrowed from Milt Jackson and Mel Torme. But the real surprises are Hiseman and Heckstall-Smith, now kingpins of the infamous jazz-rock big band Colosseum, Hiseman because he's serviceable and Heckstall-Smith because he's a pleasure--his melodies striking, his eclecticism intelligent and strong-willed. The thinness of his tone, however, is frustrating--he is the lead voice, after all.

This fluent, affluent rumination on the price of sin and the wages of success really isn't how they do it in L.A. anymore, which must be why I had such a hassle getting a handle on it. Moral signposts are provided by the covers: rock and roll ""It Was I"" (love is painful), pop ""September Song"" (and the most precious thing there is), country ""A Satisfied Mind"" (so be thankful for what you've got). Now if only Lindsey didn't spend so much time flexing his archness, all this might be perceptible to the naked ear.

Like most rappers, Richard Terfry sings at his peril, and like most rappers, he's better off with made beats than played ones. Nevertheless, with occasional input from Tortoise and D-Styles, he and two Halifax pals reclaim the sonic legacy of Serge Gainsbourg. His growly flow confuses Afrocentrists, and there's a chance the guy ""who can't tell the difference between real art and high kitsch"" will prove to be Terfry himself. But even free-associating he can outrhyme 99 percent of the spitters who've never heard of him, and every time the one about the goldfish comes up it's clear he has more stories to tell.

I value my time too much to mess with downloads on spec, but knowing me for a fan, Nova Scotian rap mutant Rich Terfry was slick enough to burn me three untracked one-hour CDs. These have been good by now for five-six spins apiece, usually as background music--as my wife will vouch, they're excellent for sharing breakfast or settling down to sleep. The beats are basic and original--dig that bluegrass, that koto, that Shadowy thrum. Ever the wordslinger, Buck is usually rhyming, and usually worth hearing when you direct your ears his way: ""Hooker in a mink coat died on a Friday/Crappy UFO on the side of the highway,"" ""Can't make sense of the menu I'm readin'/Mistakenly playin' the wrong venue in Sweden."" We'll find out whether there are Real Songs here when he releases a Real Album. I just hope he salvages the 50 Cent dis 42 minutes into the second disc, where he IDs his philosophy of hip-hop as Italian neo-realism as opposed to MGM. ""I created a religion based on wild misinterpretation,"" he raps. ""Dancing is not important to me--you got a problem with that?""

Everybody's (everyman's) (everystar's?) favorite girlfriend gets production from Rick Derringer and Ric Ocasek on material originating with Love, Tom Petty, Iggy Pop, and--the biggest winner, no doubt because it's the biggest obscurity--the Nightcrawlers, whose ""Little Black Egg"" went local in L.A. circa 1967. Those who complain about the size of her voice would probably do the same about her tits. I say she sings with a courtesan's confidence and intend a compliment.

Recorded July 1, 1998, a 78-minute double-CD proves how stiff and thin this made-up collective's mysteriously canonical 1997 studio album is. How? By kicking off with and obliterating the same three songs in the same order, then moving on to a less striking rendition of the lead track from the much better Introducing . . . Ruben Gonzalez. Together for years by then, they're playing off each other and to a crowd--looser, louder, showier, more excited. Yet even so, chief vocalists Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo never leap the language barrier the way pianist Gonzalez does, and if this be the last hurrah of genuine Cuban son, what are those Cooders doing in the mix, and those rumba horns? For too long in the middle, it's just pleasurable exotica-next-door. But then the climactic ""Candela"" goes an extra minute-and-a-half for a reason. And then Ferrer and Portuondo get beautiful.

Buffett's certainly more likable than the average professional rakehell--he's complex, he's honest, he takes good care of his sense of humor, and above all he doesn't come on like a hot shit. This is his most reflective album, and though I'm nothing like him--""Wonder Why We Ever Go Home"" is hardly my take on aging--I find myself interested whenever he stops and thinks, which happens mostly on side one. ""Banana Republics,"" about expatriates reaping the wages (and pleasures) of imperialism even if Buffett would never put it that way, is my favorite, but I also love this breakthrough insight from his breakthrough single: ""Some people claim that there's a woman to blame/But I know it's my own damn fault.""

""In a world that's not so bad,"" Doug Martsch builds a hideout worth visiting--more tree house than basement or cave, with hooks for footholds and misty guitar vistas when you finish the climb.

So when he says, ""You won't help anyone/cause you're unusable,"" he can't possibly be talking about himself. I hope.

They claim jazz so hard that either they're inordinately proud of that stupid flute feature or they don't know what they're doing, which is nailing an instrumental funk situated somewhere between the MG's and the Meters. Master DJ Kid Koala is one crucial attraction--probably supplied the cracker-barrel riffs on their name. Another is rapper James ""Blu Rum 12"" Sobers, whose ""Reverse Psychology"" mines a tradition that goes back to Dr. Hook's ""Levitate.""

In which Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson, and eleven other English folkies redo twelve American songs, and I bet the Silver Beatles loved every one of them. The conjunction brings out the passionately droll in all the principals, especially Denny and Thompson, but the great moments are ""The Loco-Motion,"" with Linda Peters playing Little Eva, and ""Nadine,"" which Tyger Hutchings delivers deadpan, as if reading off cue cards after a quick runthrough.

With the ""Bishop of Soul"" backed by Brenda Bergman's Realtones, this live double from America's premier folkie label looks like an irrelevance, but the D.C. audience signifies otherwise. Burke's singing has lost subtlety rather than power, and since all but two of the twenty-four songs he sets his voice to are relegated to medleys, his reading of specific lyrics aren't the issue so much as the preacherly context he creates for them--the way his monologues connect musically acute texts like ""If You Need Me"" and ""Hold What You've Got"" and ""Down in the Valley"" and ""Gotta Get You Off of My Mind"" to the facts of love in a world where women sign their own welfare checks.

With his fondness for the grand gesture, I just knew Burke was going to build the hushed title cut to a crescendo, but instead of trivializing the song with a false resolution he maintains its tension for seven minutes. That's the triumph, but the same level of taste prevails--this is a modern soul album that engages the material at hand instead of pimping for reactionaries. And with contributions from the likes of Paul Kelly and Jimmy Lewis, the material is worth engaging.

Burnett's foray into straight country is right purty, but it could stand to get a little bent. Abjuring strings, backup choruses, trap sets, puns, and sales potential, it takes the neo out of neotraditionalism, and though I smiled when T-Bone bought his baby ""clothes of rayon,"" I was disturbed to realize that even his synthetics are ensconced in the past.

Marcus Garvey dub, with the instrumental tracks remixed to create illusions of depth and focus. I know two people who consider it one of the great reggae albums, and oddly enough neither is a doper. Odd because, though I'm not much of a doper myself, I find that marijuana greatly enhances appreciation of this music. Which makes sense--marijuana certainly enhanced its creation as well.

Ever more delicate backup horns subsume ever more docile backup vocals as his unearthly outcries grow more coaxing, less admonitory. But the end is the same: Winston Rodney is so synchronic that in 1982 he gives up pretty much the same trancy buzz as in 1976. He's just less excited about it.

FALSE,B+,People of the World,Burning Spear,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4482,"
Like many angry young men before him, Winston Rodney has mellowed with the gathering years and assets. And like many angry young men before him, he's surrendered some edge. Innate musicality plus the right cushy production will sometimes benefit victims of this syndrome, and here he finds the formula, keyed to a horn section that happens to comprise three American women. So all hail unity and the honorable disc-race.

Burton's only competition among nouveau rockabilly composers is the Blasters' Dave Alvin, and like almost anyone with a knack for song form in 1982 he's flexible. In fact, his only remaining link to pure rockabilly is a fondness for novelty numbers like the factual ""Rabies Shots"" and the utterly heretical ""Breathe for Me, Presley!,"" and in the end his sense of humor is his limitation. In rock and roll of any kind you have to sing better than Robert Klein.

The Hiccups make with good old guitar, bass, and drums while Charlie fakes some rockabilly up front, and when it works it's quite catchy in an utterly received sort of way. The conservatism isn't annoying or boring because although Charlie loves this music--listen to ""One Man's Trash""--he doesn't give a damn for roots or form. He just wants to write some songs. I'm not sorry he doesn't share my liberal respect for Vietnam and world hunger, and when he diddleybops through his parents' coronaries I know why. Inspirational Verse: ""Water's thick, but blood is thicker/Daddy (Mommy) had a bum, bum ticker.""

FALSE,B+,Minimum Wage Rock & Roll,Bus Boys,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4486,"
They climax with their own ""Respect,"" which climaxes ""If you don't like rock 'n' roll music you can kiss my ass."" And they mean it, man, though their idea of rock 'n' roll--AOR guitar breaks, rhythms less funky than Jeff Porcaro's or Don Christensen's, harmonies that owe the Beach Boys and Steely Dan--is too uncool to break through the prejudices of the hipsters prone to cheer five blacks and a Chicano for putting it out. Sometimes they aim too straight for the charts, but when they play their existential joke--speaking up for dishwashers and shoeshine boys, for blacks who think immigrants are destroying the neighborhood and blacks who win one for the coach and blacks who join the Klan so they can join a band--I say cool. Inspirational Verse: ""Bet you never heard music like this by spades.""

FALSE,B+,American Worker,Bus Boys,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4487,"
At first I was no more impressed by this professional black arena-rock than I am by, say, professional lesbian folk-rock. Less, actually--bombast is annoying. But in the end I was disarmed by the audacity, esprit, and sheer versatility--not many arena-rockers are comfortable simulating funk, reggae, and surf music--and won over by the songs themselves, every one informed by the kind of middle-American compassion you might expect from a black band with enough soul to hope to touch the arena-rock masses.
"
FALSE,B+,The Best of Johnny Bush,Johnny Bush,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6517,"
When Bush's hurting, almost operatic baritone strains against Tommy Hill's spare, hard, danceable arrangements, you begin to suspect that God did make honky-tonk angels after all--male ones. Now if only all of Bush's hosannas were as terse and colloquial as the three Willie Nelson songs here. Hyperbolic corn can work in country music--Bush's dramatization of Marty Robbins's ""You Gave Me a Mountain"" brings a catch to the throat and a tear to the eye. But too often the corn here is as commonplace as Bush's big legit move, a cover of ""All in the Game.""
"
FALSE,B+,The Dreaming,Kate Bush,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4488,"
The most impressive Fripp/Gabriel-style art-rock album of the postpunk refulgence makes lines like ""I love life"" and ""Some say knowledge is something that you never have"" say something. Part of the reason is that Bush is flaky enough to seek the higher plane in ""a hired plane,"" although as you might expect the resulting analysis often crumbles under scrutiny. It also helps that the emotional range of her singing sometimes approaches its physical range, although when it doesn't you'd best duck. But the revelation is the dense, demanding music, which gets the folk exoticism of current art-rock fashion out of mandolins and uillean pipes and didgeridoos rather than clumsy polyrhythms, and goes for pop outreach with hooks rather than clumsy polyrhythms.
"
FALSE,B+,Fashion Maswedi,Mzikayifani Buthelezi,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4492,"
A traditionally raised country Zulu, he sings like he's calling cattle or berating his six wives while his brother saws away on concertina or violin and groups of wives and male underlings muscle up to the mike. Pretty raw even for mbaqanga, and pretty repetitive, too--Jo'burg rhythm pros provide the now-familiar four-four. But familiarity doesn't flatten the overall intensity--instead, Buthelezi's wail demonstrates its character. If someone had bothered to pick and choose from his 100-plus titles instead of rereleasing an old album, he might end up more than a strange name in a catalogue.
"
FALSE,B+,Easy Life,Chris Butler,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16253,"
It has its slow spots, especially on a few fast-forwards from 1970, but this cobbled-together concept album by a long-scrabbling professional on the rock fringe earns its subtitle: ""The Bohemian Dream &amp; American Nightmare of Kent State 1970."" The buoyant title track evokes the late-hippie mindset as accurately as Neil Young's melancholy ""Don't Let It Bring You Down,"" and the surrounding historical detail powers an acute portrait of a movement that was simultaneously casual and righteous--a movement of young people who'd never seen their world contract and couldn't believe it actually might. Part one of the long tale that ends the album proper climaxes with a road trip to see the Dead in Cleveland, during which Butler sneaks onstage and plays beer can until Jerry tells him to shut the fuck up. In part two, the bummed-out kid gives his drum kit to Jeff Miller three weeks before Miller becomes one of four Kent State students slaughtered by the Ohio National Guard on May 4, 1970. The postscript is Creedence's ""Fortunate Son,"" which lest you've forgotten is about not being one.
"
FALSE,B+,It All Comes Back,Paul Butterfield's Better Days,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6524,"
In which Butter returns to his own better days, when his miraculously unaffected but colorless singing provided pleasant valleys from which his weirdo sidemen could peak. The prize here is Geoff Muldaur's rendition of Bobby Charles's ""Small Town Talk,"" a song about back-stabbers that sounds as if it was made for the exurban bohemian community where the music originated--probably because that's the community it was written about. Ronnie Barron's frenetic remake of his own ""Louisiana Flood"" comes in second.
"
FALSE,B+,Psychic . . . Powerless . . . Another Man's Sac,The Butthole Surfers,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3513,"
Truly repulsive music imposes the most stringent of aesthetic standards--who wants to listen if it's just good? So while I'm sort of impressed by the (relative) accessibility of their first full-length LP--guitar that might actually win over some wayward metal freak seeking X-rated thrills--I must report that only ""Lady Sniff,"" punctuated by perfectly timed gobs, pukes, farts, belches, and Mexican radio, lives up to ""The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's Grave.""
"
FALSE,B+,A Different Kind of Tension,Buzzcocks,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3518,"
I suppose people call them a pop band because they still write about love, but that they say ""I can't love you"" rather than the usual does make a difference. Not in profundity--one sentiment is as banal as the other--but in a mood that suits a sound as bright and abrasive as new steel wool. Pete Shelley articulates his truisms with insight as well as flair, especially in ""You Say You Don't Love Me"" and ""I Believe."" My favorite, though, is Steve Diggle's ""You Know You Can't Help It,"" about sex, which I'm happy to report he likes--although he does observe that ""love makes war."" Hey, does it?
"
FALSE,B+,Ballad of Easy Rider,The Byrds,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10964,"
I'm sorry to report that this is the poorest Byrds album. It improves with listening, especially at high volume, but Roger McGuinn does seem to be returning to his roots, which unfortunately lie deep in commercial folk music. All the rock dynamics are fading, and what replaces them is thoughtful but not compelling.
"
FALSE,B+,Do the Boomerang: The Music of Junior Walker,Don Byron,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13419,"
First: Sounds grrreat. Then: Who needs this arty clarinetist with Walker's gutbucket sax a click away? Finally: Terrific modern jazz-funk record ������������������ la Hank Crawford, with just enough just-funky-enough vocals to counteract Byron's smooth tone on sax. Check th""Shotgun"" on Walker's Millennium Collection or Ultimate Collection, then the Rodney Holmes syncopations beneath Byron's version. Benjamin is a titan and Holmes isn't. But Holmes has heard James Brown, and the change'll do you good.
"
FALSE,B+,Sex and Soul,Roy C.,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6530,"
Roy Hammond is a driven artist--he cut this in his garage--and his compulsiveness comes out in the lyrics; despite convincing asides about racism and Vietnam, his title ought to be Infidelity and Suffering. The songs are raw and outspoken, and the suffering's in the voice even more than the words--he strains its paradoxically mellow limits sometimes, so seekers after the Perfect Note should seek elsewhere. But old Swamp Dogg fans will put aside their feminist reservations and learn how the other half lives.
"
FALSE,B+,Special Edition,J.J. Cale,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4494,"
When he came up, Cale seemed one more carrier of the laid-back contagion, but fifteen years later, with the contagion dispersed into the adult-contemporary ether and its carriers in hock up to their souls, you have to respect him for the principled bluesman he's proven to be. Principled, but distinctly minor--only convinced narcoleptics want the complete set. The rest of us will be happy to stop at this compilation, though we'd be happier if it didn't pass up ""Call Me the Breeze"" and ""I Got the Same Old Blues"" for more up-to-date entries.
"
FALSE,B+,Paris 1919,John Cale,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1759,"
In which Cale subsumes Little Feat, the academy in stasis, and other subversive elements into a form known generically (don't tell anyone) as schlock-rock. Winsome stuff it is, too--delectable melodies, dulcet singing, and such civilized rhymes as ""Andalucia"" and ""see ya."" But when you try to get past the surface pleasure of phrases like ""claim you with my iron drum"" and ""cows that agriculture won't allow"" you realize that poets who emulate Edward Lear had better be funny about it--or else stick with Delmore Schwartz.
"
FALSE,B+,Honi Soit,John Cale,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12060,"
After a mere eight months of diligent listening I've concluded that Cale's fans were right--his songwriting has regained its adroitness. And after a mere eight minutes of random thought I've concluded that I was right too--his singing hasn't.
"
FALSE,B+,Los de Atras Vienen Conmigo,Calle 13,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14353,"
You don't have to speak Spanish to conclude that this arty, political San Juan rap duo deserve their rocketing reputation--I sure can't, though when I squint at the booklet my puny recognition vocabulary helps. But you do have to immerse and concentrate--and accept that you'll miss most of what's going on even then. They're reggaeton only by association, a lot further from Daddy Yankee's hey-mami dancehall than the Roots were from Dr. Dre's jeep-pimping funk. By all accounts and the little I can work out, their lyrics are playfully associative and outrageously filthy. But for gringos, their humor resides almost entirely in Visitante's out-there arrangements and Residente's overt vocal comedy, as on the Balkanized ""Fiesta de Locos."" If some promotional visionary were to provide trots, that might change. But as it is, big guests Caf������������������ Tacuba and Ruben Blades are too mainstream to launch C"
FALSE,B+,Style,Cameo,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4498,"
It never peaks, which means it'll never be as hot a party record as the A side of Alligator Woman, but this on-the-one cartoon (cf. Slave's Showtime) is an all-round showcase for syndrum natural Larry Blackmon, funk's most underutilized resource. Keyb man Charles Singleton does smart stuff with the slow stuff by covering ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" and making something of the atmospheric ""Interlude (Serenity)."" Maybe next time they'll only abandon their God-given tempo to sex it up heavy like on ""Slow Movin'.""
"
FALSE,B+,Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart,Camper Van Beethoven,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=528,"
Suddenly these postmodern postfolkie weirdos are transformed into, of all things, a rock band--sans chops. And unfortunately, chops are an issue: both the one-dimensional matter-of-factness of the vocal concept and the time-keeping world-beat-by-numbers of the rhythmic philosophy stick out of Dennis Herring's honest AOR production, which messes up the band's balance even though it leaves everything but the mix untouched. Beneath this disorienting surface the message continues its evolution toward postanomie, and it would be a kick to hear ""Life Is Grand,"" say, on the radio. Not AOR, though--college radio, where the nay-sayers it's aimed at call the shots.
"
FALSE,B+,Key Lime Pie,Camper Van Beethoven,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=529,"
After an instrumental establishes the band's voice, out march four amazing songs--two literal, two associative, all smart, ambitious, eccentric, eloquent, unassuming, compassionate, and cognizant of history. Music's a more forceful version of their by now homey-sounding bouzouki-rock, and when the country-rock guitar hook snakes professionally out of the associative ""Sweet Hearts"" it makes sense somehow. But on an album they call ""bittersweet""--""not gloomy, but moody""--those four songs are pretty much it. ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"" smirks cheerfully at hippie nostalgia, and ""All Her Favorite Fruit"" is all those good adjectives. But both are swamped by music that's not gloomy, not moody, just lugubrious; the big drumbeats evoke nothing so much as the gong at a Chinese funeral. They knew better back when skinhead jokes were funny.
"
FALSE,B+,The Spotlight Kid,Captain Beefheart,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=537,"
Cap's much-bruited commercial bid turns out to have all the mass appeal of King of the Delta Blues Singers, complete with modernized terraplane and an avowal of primitivism in which the Kid threatens to ""Grow Fins."" All the primordial themes are here--sex, love, poverty, destiny, ecology--and the Howlin' Wolf imitations are as dense and heartfelt as the music. Still, Robert Johnson cuts him, and primitivism is rarely better the second time around. Maybe the Stones could cover ""I'm Gonna Booglarize You Baby."" But if this were all it's cracked up to be, that wouldn't be the only candidate.
"
FALSE,B+,I'm Going to Do What I Wanna Do: Live at My Father's Place,Captain Beefheart,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=543,"
Title protestations to the contrary, Don Van Vliet promos like a good touring artist should, supporting a near-great album that 22 years later has left the catalog (for the nonce) as nine de facto bonus tracks reprise his illustrious underground career. Live on this November night, his music was slacker and more forceful than on the studio Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller). His anointed helpers weren't improvisers, not hardly. But they were a fairly magic band.
"
FALSE,B+,Trout Mask Replica,Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10873,"
I find it impossible to give this record an A because it is just too weird. But I'd like to. Very great played at high volume when you're feeling shitty, because you'll never feel as shitty as this record.
"
FALSE,B+,Clear Spot,Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=536,"
This one really does rock out--it's got the Blackberries, horn charts, everything the promotion department could ask except a hummable tune. Much womanizing, of course--rather less, er, allusive than usual but laced with the unexpected, as in the title ""Nowadays a Woman's Gotta Hit a Man,"" a prescription from which Cap exempts himself. But what makes it work is that it really rocks out.
"
FALSE,B+,Mirror Man,Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6542,"
Recorded one night in 1965, these four pieces, which go on for more than fifty minutes, seem insultingly sloppy and thin at first--lacking Beefheart's later rhythmic assurance and aural density. But in their linear way they're pretty crazy and pretty involving. Makes you wonder why the Captain got left out of all the blues jams that followed in his wake.
"
FALSE,B+,First Band on the Moon,The Cardigans,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3522,"
Popper-than-thou aggregation backs cute blonde for fun and profit. Think Blondie. They're Swedish. Think Abba. They're Euroalt-by-default. Think, er, Bettie Serveert. Only nowadays, anythinger-than-thou commits you to that extra mile, so that these reformed metalheads make their Beatle move a la Black Velvet Flag. And since metalheads can really, how you say it, play their axes, they also score some funny Black Sabbath covers. As for the blonde, alt types were calling her dark even back when she was imitating a love doll. Me, I prefer her now that she's imitating a cynical young woman--especially since the metalheads provide dissonances suitable to her self-critical rhetoric, which greatly smartens their flute and tinkle.
"
FALSE,B+,KMAG YOYO,Hayes Carll,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15271,"
A little too decisively to instill much hope for his love life, the rowdy songs are deeper than the thoughtful ones, especially the duet with Young Republican Cary Ann Hearst, who thinks she might screw him even though he can't afford to tip the stripper. But he does rowdy real good. And the filial ""Grateful for Christmas"" enters the canon of alt-country unholiday songs well ahead of the Drive-Bys' competing entry--maybe even on a level with James McMurtry's and Robert Earl Keen's.
"
FALSE,B+,Just a Passing Change,Don Carlos,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4502,"
Although Carlos isn't as consistent as ranking romeo Gregory Isaacs, his peaks--the title tune, in which he glimpses Selassie's ghost from behind modest dub and haunting horns, and ""I Just Can't Stop,"" in which he flees Babylon till the break of dawn--bliss out the way true spiritual pop should. They lift the gracefully ordinary tunes way up even if three generically anonymous closers drag side two back down.
"
FALSE,B+,Take Me to the Limit,James Carr,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1647,"
Most of Carr's legend is in his voice, a great grave thing that doesn't so much interpret his best material as haunt it, and for as long as the songs on this album hold out the voice holds out too--even on the lighthearted ""Sugar Shock."" I think that's how it works, anyway--all I can swear is that somewhere around cut seven the proceedings thicken uncomfortably and then grind to a near-halt. Since the rest of Carr's legend revolves around his long periods of seclusion, I attributed the undistanced commitment of his rare, recent live show to the fact that he'd never sung his great songs into the ground. Having since located this record, I now suspect that some of those I thought I'd forgotten were new. ""Take Me to the Limit"" and ""She's Already Gone"" are squarely in the obsessive tradition of ""Dark End of the Street,"" which belonged to him first.

FALSE,B+,Tex-Mex Rock-Roll,"Joe ""King"" Carrasco and El Molino",1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1735,"
Like the Western swing it rocks and rolls, Tex-Mex is an acquired taste--often a little lightweight, but say that in the wrong bar in Austin and things might get heavy. Anyway, this is the real stuff, more striking than anything on Augie Meyers's dependable Texas Re-Cord Company label mostly because Carrasco writes songs of no special significance that might just as well have originated on the Rio Grande 100 years ago. Favorite titles: ""Jalapeno con Big Red"" and ""Rock Esta Noche.""
"
FALSE,B+,Catholic Boy,The Jim Carroll Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4507,"
Two big differences between Jim and Patti--Patti has no jump shot and Jim's a boy. Hence the title, I know, 'cept women get away with this kind of fringe/decadent hero/survivor myth/boaster better than men--it's fresher for them, not such a line. Face it, Jim's a phony--a moral weakling who's been charming suckers ever since he ran away from home. And if that's not the end of it, well, charming suckers takes talent--a lot easier to get by tending bar. He's got a great eye, a great memory, great connections. He knows how to put himself across. And he wrote ""People Who Died.""
"
FALSE,B+,The Cars,The Cars,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3524,"
Ric Ocasek writes catchy, hardheaded-to-coldhearted songs eased by wryly rhapsodic touches, the playing is tight and tough, and it all sounds wonderful on the radio. But though on a cut-by-cut basis Roy Thomas Baker's production adds as much as it distracts, here's hoping the records get rawer. That accentuated detachment may feel like a Roxy Music move in the first flush of studio infatuation, but schlock it up a little and this band really could turn into an American Queen.
"
FALSE,B+,Candy-O,The Cars,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3525,"
Hooks are mechanical by nature, but the affectlessness of these deserves special mention; only listeners who consider ""alienation is the craze"" a great insight will find much meaning here. On the other hand, only listeners who demand meaning in all things will find this useless. Cold and thin, shiny and hypnotic, it's what they do best--rock and roll that is definitely pop without a hint of cuteness. Which means that for them ""alienation is the craze"" may be a meaningful statement after all.
"
FALSE,B+,Heartbeat City,The Cars,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4511,"
With hooks recurring as predictably as zebras on a carousel or heartbeats in a city, the glossy approach the Cars invented has made this the best year for pure pop in damn near twenty, and it's only fair that they should return so confidently to form. They still don't have much to say and they're still pretty arch about it, but that's no reason for anybody to get unduly bothered, and neither is Greg Hawkes's Fairlight.
"
FALSE,B+,Sixty Minutes With Clarence Carter,Clarence Carter,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6551,"
The title has nothing to do with the record's duration--it's yet another play on this soul survivor's back-door-man routine. But thanks to Rich Hall's confident cop of the Allmans' high lick and an unusual things-ain't-getting-better lyric from George Jackson, a lot of this is more than routine.
"
FALSE,B+,At the Crossroads,James Carter Organ Trio,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15663,"
This occasional unit's live 2005 Out of Nowhere was a honking session, beefing up the young world-champeen multisaxer with Hamiet Bluiett's bari master class and Blood Ulmer's harmolodic Son House shtick. The most luscious beef on this more contained studio job is provided by guest singer Miche Braden sinking her chops into Fluffy Hunter's playfully filthy ""Walking Blues"" and a lounge through Muddy Waters's ""Ramblin' Blues."" The lounge feel is shored up by sometime guitarist Bruce Edwards, who if he ain't Ulmer at least ain't Jim Hall. Gotta admit it's a relief, though, when sometime guitarist Brandon Ross disrupts the long Julius Hemphill-penned closer. Even the organist, who does his job manfully throughout and whose name is Gerard Gibbs, avants around on that one.
"
FALSE,B+,Hell-On,Neko Case,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17332,"
Lyrically and melodically, Case has never been more accessible or accomplished. Emotionally, however, she's as distant as ever, and no longer inclined to soften that fact with a reassuring scrim of obscurism. Like her, you may well think God is a tire fire and petroleum an offense against the organic life it exploits and destroys. But that won't make the two of you allies--she rides alone. Here she's smartest and most effective memorializing a family friend who abused children without assaulting them sexually or physically, rendering him the proximate cause of ""Curse of the I-5 Corridor"" and its devastated ""So I left home and faked my ID/And fucked every man that I wanted to be.""
"
FALSE,B+,Johnny Cash Is Coming to Town,Johnny Cash,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4515,"
I'd have let his contract lapse too--the pathetic Class of '55 proved he was a has-been, huzzahs and all. But he was holding a few in reserve, like definitive Elvis Costello and Guy Clark, overdue James Talley and (why did nobody ever think of this?) Ernie Ford, and the song-factory prizes any Nashvillean with a mind to can turn up: ""The Night Hank Williams Came to Town,"" a hit, and ""Heavy Metal (Don't Mean Rock and Roll to Me),"" recommended to Mikhail Gorbachev for Goskino's next tractor movie. And then there are the two originals, which convince me he's still a has-been.
"
FALSE,B+,Out Among the Stars,Johnny Cash,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16127,"
The main reason you marvel that material this good was left in the can for 30 years is how many country albums settle for less. But the main reason the material itself astonishes is that Cash is so on his game in what was historically a fallow, coming-down-again biographical moment. In one novelty he gets it on with a chivalrously unnamed Minnie Pearl; in another, he puts a hundred bucks down on a Cadillac and drives it off a cliff on his last date with his ex-wife. Two love songs achieve high seriousness without whispering mawk. And Cash gets so much more out of Adam Mitchell's death-by-cop title song than Merle Haggard or Hazel Dickens. His natural gravity helps. But n.b., Rick Rubin: so does his possession of his bottomless pit of a voice.
"
FALSE,B+,Seven Year Ache,Rosanne Cash,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3012,"
It's a tribute to persistence of something-or-other that somebody should still be getting decent music out of the sterile studio-rock formula. What that something-or-other might be is perhaps indicated by the identity of the somebody, who is second-generation pro rather than a punk revoloo.
"
FALSE,B+,Somewhere in the Stars,Rosanne Cash,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4517,"
That ""Third Rate Romance"" is the least impressive thing here is proof enough of Cash's continuing growth--""Third Rate Romance"" is damn near impossible to ruin, and she doesn't come close. But since I was never much of a Ronstadtian myself, I can't quite make the leap from admiring the assured warmth and easy precision of Linda's de facto successor to inviting her over.

FALSE,B+,Cee-Lo Green . . . Is the Soul Machine,Cee-Lo,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12334,"
The intro, where he refuses to start until he's done chuckling over the failure of his baby boy to pronounce ""soul machine,"" sums up a guy neither as humble nor as special as he thinks. Half God's gift to hip-hop, half man of the people, he never quite puts all his good tracks together or across. These include trademarked Timbaland and Ludacris collabs, love song and friend song and antigangsta rave, the one at the beginning where he wishes he ""could write one song to right all wrongs"" (which who wouldn't?) and the one at the end where he swears he'll ""die trying"" to do just that (which he won't).

FALSE,B+,Quintessentially Yours,The Celibate Rifles,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4518,"
All right, they do lash out with a nice, nasty buzz--reminds me of those long-lost speed boys the Vibrators. But no pretenders who take most of their 1985 Yank debut from their 1983 Aussie debut and none of it from the follow-up are getting any rock and roll future awards from me.

FALSE,B+,Love in C Minor,Cerrone,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6558,"
Catchy tracks, a remake of ""Black Is Black,"" and a new standard in disco porn--the protagonist brings three women to simultaneous orgasm while keeping one finger on the ""Door Close"" button.
"
FALSE,B+,Check In,The Chalets,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13645,"
Big in Ireland, where this album is 2 years old, two gals and three guys prove a little too cute and through-conceived to fully exploit the innocence of the ""Two Chord Song,"" as their most compelling number is entitled. But excellent gender conflicts bedeck their well-enunciated lyrics, and if you can imagine yourself being unable to resist a chorus that goes ""I know you love me but you're f***ing crazy/I know you love me but you're f***ing crazy,"" you definitely won't resist this one.
"
FALSE,B+,The Captain,Kasey Chambers,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1882,"
If the voice doesn't get you, what can I say--you're not me, and you're also not a whole bunch of other people. Its burred drawl is deep country like Iris DeMent; its little-girl timbre evokes Dolly Parton and whispers Lolita. It's utterly arresting, and as soon as it warbles, ""I never lived through the Great Depression/Sometimes I feel as though I did,"" you want to kiss her. Of course, when it gets to ""I'm not much like my generation/Their music only hurts my ears,"" you may wish you'd pulled her nose instead. And when you learn that her ""southern kind of life"" took place in southern Australia--the cold part, noted for its drawl--you begin to suspect she's Gillian Welch without the death trip. You notice that her arrangements are slick country-rock, that her worldview is old hat, that you don't even know what the catchy title number means. So better not give your heart to this AC-ready 24-year-old-not yet. But by all means enjoy her voice and hum her tunes, which are delicious as music and dazzling as aesthetic constructions. And invest your hopes in the two kiss-offs--one to a boyfriend, the other to the world.

FALSE,B+,Modern Heart,Champaign,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4520,"
This clean, middle-American pop-funk's commitment to quality is so modest that its ""concept"" may well be not to stand out. So it takes forever to penetrate. But where most merely professional tunesmiths get irritating with prolonged exposure, Champaign start to glow--modestly, of course.

FALSE,B+,Stroll on With the Duke,Gene Chandler,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11450,"
How bitterly you bewail Chandler's relative obscurity depends on how unconditionally you credit Curtis Mayfield's genius. Me, I consider the Chicago sound second-city and don't find Chandler especially adept at negotiating the turns of the seven Mayfield songs on this admirably consistent early-'60s collection. Only the live ""Rainbow '65"" stands out like Jerry Butler's ""Bless Our Love"" or Bernice Williams's ""Festival of Love"" and ""The Big Lie."" And lest you suspect otherwise, Chandler never came close to topping ""Duke of Earl.""

FALSE,B+,The Glow of Love,Change,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4522,"
""New and true and gay,"" this gold album confirms disco's continuing autonomy as a market and as a style. From the Rodgers-&amp;-Edwards rip of ""A Lover's Holiday"" to the good ole Giorgio Moroder of ""The End,"" here's the complete bag of tricks. Luther Vandross's best Teddy Pendergrass impression doesn't redeem the militantly escapist lyrics and probably isn't meant to. But ""It's a Girl's Affair,"" sung by Jocelyn Shaw, is a softcore treat--and spell that ""Girls'"" on your next printing, please.
"
FALSE,B+,Miracles,Change,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4523,"
Where their debut took off from its moments of raunch, this is pure fantasy fare--the you-can-work-it-out advisories ""Hold Tight,"" ""Your Move,"" and ""Stop for Love"" never get down (to details), and ""On Top,"" ""Heaven of My Life,"" ""Paradise,"" and ""Miracles"" aren't exactly realistic (note titles). But what a terrific fantasy--so bright and casual and full of life. The hip punch of Mauro Malavasi's keyboards puts the dream in motion, and Diva Gray's lithe, modest vocals bring it to bed.

FALSE,B+,Tracy Chapman,Tracy Chapman,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4030,"
""Fast Car"" is so far-seeing, ""Mountains o' Things"" so necessary, that it's doubly annoying when she puts her name on begged questions like ""Why"" and ""Talkin' Bout a Revolution."" Maybe I should be heartened and so forth that Intelligent Young People are once again pushing naive left-folkie truisms, but she's too good for such condescension--even sings like a natural. Get real, girl.

FALSE,B+,A Message From the People,Ray Charles,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5275,"
Beginning with ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" an anthem sung by black schoolchildren, and climaxing with ""America the Beautiful,"" ditto but with less reason, Charles says his piece. Like the ecologist he is, he extracts all remaining truth from ""Abraham, Martin and John,"" and though he may be naive he adds a menace to ""Heaven Help Us All"" that Stevie Wonder wasn't genius enough to convey and turns Melanie's ""What Have They Done to My Song, Ma"" into the outcry of black musicians everywhere--which is probably why it rocks (and swings) like nothing he's done in years.

The problem with this Norman Granz brainstorm is Laine, a singer of formidable technique and zero soul who usually gives me tension headaches. But though she's nothing to write liner notes about, only rarely does her unnaturalness intrude--and she does do a great job with the score itself, which is no snap. Charles isn't always inspired--is he ever any more?--but the writing carries him over the smooth spots. Granz deserves credit for holding down the orchestrations and inviting Charles and his combo to improvise on the material. Of course, Granz might also unearth the Porgy and Bess he did twenty years ago with Ella and Louis--as might you. But this will do.

FALSE,B+,In Color,Cheap Trick,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=573,"
Nowadays, punk makes it possible to resist hard rock so slickly textured, but with these guys why bother?

Guess so.

For better or worse, and it's both, this is kind of what you'd figure sort of: a Sonic Youth record dominated by that band's most important member. It's also a record that makes us love Steve Shelley, because John Mooney's drums never propel Thurston past virtual pogo territory--and that says nothing of what a nice change it used to be to have someone besides Thurston sing. Imagine that ""Sleeping Where I Fall"" addresses his former bassist-wife if you want, but believe that the whole album is conceived as a bohemian history lesson. Present and accounted for are a flower child who prefers her music free, a song by Darby Crash, a song about Darby Crash, a song to William S. Burroughs, a song linking Dylan to Frank O'Hara, and ""Groovy &amp; Linda,"" who FYI were real hippie speed freaks surnamed Hutchinson and Fitzpatrick who were murdered in a boiler room two blocks from my apartment in 1967.

FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Cher,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6572,"
Snuff Garrett states her case more loudly than Sonny ever did, and if like me you have a soft spot in your heart for unabashed brass you find her biggest hits irresistible. The great Swarthy Trilogy--""Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves,"" ""Half-Breed,"" and ""Dark Lady""--is proof of an album that cut for cut is as vulgar as any in the post-Beatles era: Grand Funk is more wholesome and more arty, Neil Diamond a rabbi by comparison. She's at least as authentic as Tammy Wynette, too. Not all of these were such big hits, but who cares when one of the ringers is ""Melody,"" the name of an old doll to whom a just-deflowered Cher sings her proud confession.
"
FALSE,B+,Don Cherry,Don Cherry,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11307,"
A clear-eyed charity animates Cherry's three recent albums: Eternal Now (Antilles), dominated by Asian and African folk instruments; Hear &amp; Now (Atlantic), produced with standard electric jazz instrumentation by Narada Michael Walden; and this Eastward-looking acoustic jazz LP. Rather than transporting him into kitschy esoterica or providing an excuse for profitable one-worlder populism, Cherry's religious leanings seem to inspire a gut respect for the uses of musical ritual, whether in a Chinese temple or a movie-theatre-turned-rock-palace, so that he can recycle what is fresh about the folk roots and popular branches of the free-jazz idiom without betraying his own commitment to it. Not that his work isn't marred by rambling passages and received riffs; even this album, featuring musicians like Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins, has its share of sappy moments. But I can't think of a fusion hustler or black Buddhist who couldn't learn something from his sweetness and acuity.

She's marked out a meaningful piece of turf: sophisticated secondhand homegirl, personally decent and artistically accessible, a friend to rely on. But where the lithe beats and uncorny sonics flesh out the concept and jolt every track, the lyrics settle for honest. ""The choice is mine/With my ordinary joy and pain inside"" is up toward the high end, with ""Money talks love is for real"" and ""How long can we be this way"" too typical. Personal to Yo Yo: consider a career in rhyme medicine.

If you're going to live in the past, you might as well go whole hog like Greg Prevost, who in the great blues purist tradition performs only covers--of titles no one but other garage-band collectors has ever heard. The upshot is a seamless archive of quaint adolescent macho, definitive yet utterly negligible protohippie songs rendered by a band whose claim to expertise is the mastery of a dozen marginally distinct varieties of crudity.

Although you'd figure the collaboration would suffer after both Nile and Nard started coming up with good albums of their own, the damage is amazingly slight. The title track, a true song of faith (""Stand back-to-back, believer/Meet head-to-head/Fight toe-to-toe, believer/Dance cheek-to-cheek""), achieves the rough-minded positivity the rest of the album aims for. The true song of praise that comes next is every bit as believable. And the rest is blessing enough in this negative time.

Of course, the Gap ad in question isn't exactly a geek anymore. He's a stand-up comedian bringing intelligent rap to the masses, one one-liner at a time.

""Eight Songs From Eight Members From Eight Phases of the Chills!"" announces this '82-'84 singles comp, extensively annotated for the collectors it's aimed at. And unlike the mid-period Lost EP--next they'll construct an album from work tapes by Martin Phillips's pre-Chills Same--it doesn't bog down in horizon-stretching. These are simple pop songs by young people who are proud they can play them. They're slight, but they have the spirit. Best in show: the meaningless ""Satin Doll,"" which Phillips wrote when he was seventeen--presumably for the Same.

FALSE,B+,Bach's Bottom,Alex Chilton,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=51,"
These 1975 tracks, the best already released on Chilton's long-gone Ork EP, are about as Memphis as a garbage strike. Not only does anarchic equal chaotic equal sloppy equal a mess, but soulful equals spontaneous equals off-the-cuff equals a mess. None of which is to deny that he knows how to mess around.
"
FALSE,B+,No Sex/Under Class/Wild Kingdom,Alex Chilton,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4532,"
Too blocked or tuckered out (from what?) to put a whole album together, the inventor of power pop follows Feudalist Tarts onto the brutalist charts with yet another award-winning shortie. A's an AIDS song: ""Can't get it on or even get high/Come on baby, fuck me and die."" Lead B points out that he's not ""a rich musician."" And while the finale's title promises a summing up, instead it's a real B, with throwaway guitar solo rendering it almost as long as the other two combined. Really does deserve a side all to itself. EPs sure do help you get away with stuff.

FALSE,B+,High Priest,Alex Chilton,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=53,"
Chilton had a chance to lead his little flock back onto the paths of righteousness. In a microcosm where nobody can tell good pop junk from utter shit anymore, his first four cuts are a refresher course: one Slim Harpo let get away, a callow Goffin-King throwaway, his own tasteless Buddhist joke, and ""Volare."" Each the real thing, each different, each undreamed by the Fanzine Filosofy. But after that he lets things slide, from a straight (for him) declaration of love to a Lowell Fulson boogie to covers the Fleshtones could think of. These are parlous times, Alex. Sloppy's getting harder to bring off, and cute ain't enough.

That this longtime DC horn-funk unit ain't Fela's goes without saying. It's also a given that its politics are saner than Fela's. But Michael Skereikis's felt wisdom comes as a considerable surprise. Where so many similar messages come off unthinking, you never doubt that these preoccupy Skereikis as deeply as his music. When he calls his opener ""Questions of Our Day,"" you wouldn't mind if he ran them back again. When ""Tribulation"" winds through a long list of war-torn nations, there are so many you half wish he'd stop. And when he makes the case for DC statehood, you remember that in politics, sanity alone guarantees nothing.

They're too neat--too pop, too heavy metal, too defined--for hardcore purists, but these hooks come the way I like them: one recitative/mechanical handclap/girl response/sound of breaking glass per hyperdriven two-minute song. Too bad they didn't cop more of the EP (say ""Mannequin"" and ""I Got a Gun"" in addition to ""Manzanar""), thus stretching this specially priced but suspiciously unclocked album to customary hardcore length. Approximate time: 22:30.

Like the Angry Samoans, although not as clearly or catchily, these slammers double-time metal riffs behind the rants, yielding such indelible plaints as ""Deny Everything"" (""I'm being framed""), ""Paid Vacation"" (""It's Afghanistan!""), and ""Group Sex"" (sensitive reading from the personals plus screaming title chorus).

The groove is as inspired as this crack band of blues 'n' boogie pros can make it--when Cooder, Lee, Dunn &amp; Hawkins play their hearts out, mere professionalism (also mere boogie) gets left behind, and Clapton's guitar hasn't rung so crisp and clear since Layla. The drawback is that the music is the message, everything Clapton boasts he (""still"") has ""left to say"" on ""Ain't Going Down,"" his only notable new song. If blues power were my idea of God, I might feel a transcendent presence even so. But blues power in itself isn't even my idea of a foxhole.

I liked Clark's laconic vocal presence at first, although I eventually began to feel that, like the agreeably glopless Nashville production, it flattened this material more than it deserved.

My, here's a useful item--replaces three whole tracks from the just-this-minute-deleted Old No. 1, two of them bittersweet love-and-sex songs, with three newer Texas-mythos numbers. Very conceptual, but not exactly an improvement, and I even like two of the new ones: ""Broken Hearted People,"" which is also a bittersweet love-and-sex song, and ""Texas Cookin'."" I also miss the bittersweet love-and-sex song ""Instant Coffee Blues"" very much. Maybe Texas-mythos types understand food better than outlaws--the man has written well about home-grown tomatoes.

Those who (claim to) expect them to improve on Gramsci maintain that this is where they turn bozo once and for all. I counter that they're well ahead of a lot of respectable competition--the babble surrounding Robert De Niro on ""Red Angel Dragnet,"" for instance, may well be the first evidence ever that Taxi Driver has something real to say about urban oppression. Neither their funk nor their tone-poem dub has gained much pizzazz since Sandinista!, where both were easier to avoid. But I guarantee that they're not sinking into the pop slime--they're evolving, and here's hoping that someday they write songs as terse and clear as ""Janie Jones"" at this higher level of verbal, musical, and political density.

Since I play the much-maligned Combat Rock as much as any Clash I own, the advance badmouth didn't faze me. The orchestral (synthesized?) horns on the lead cut did put me off, but most of this kicks in, stubborn and jolly and elegiac and together. In the aural fact, it isn't pathetic that Joe strums and chants as if there's no yesterday, it's brave. Convincer: ""We Are the Clash.""

These Maureen Tucker fans recorded their entire output six or seven years ago in a New Zealand that considered Split Enz the cat's pyjamas, so no wonder they went for simplicity. Give them credit for some funny moments, like the doc who takes his shot before he gives you yours, but don't expect much in the way or words, because there aren't many. What they care about is droning guitar jams. Allotted a concept notch for knowing they were a groove band. Entire Lyric of Very Nice Farfisa Theme: ""Tally ho, tally ho.""

Too doleful and detached to be as compassionate as he feels he should be, Eef Barzelay turns his best impulses into slow tunes with homely words that express concern without quite holding together or committing him to anything.

If I told you that the two other great songs here are called ""Many Rivers to Cross"" and ""Viet Nam,"" would you agree that naming this album after its ""hit"" amounts to false advertising?

Conceptually, featured vocalist Vanessa Williams and Pedro Bell's Neegrow cover are the only coups. Lyrically you'll have to settle for pidgin pygmy here, title credo there, some fast-food jokes, and the cautionary ""Cool Joe."" Groovewise it's Clonesville. In short, George's flattest in a decade.

The best-of has always been a dubious consumer service: even when it's a genuine bargain, it allows bizzers to make money off the same music twice, and don't think they don't love every dollar of it. In this case one of the bizzers is the artiste, who already stuck two of these cuts onto that strange half-live, half-compilation ""mini-album"" earlier this year. There's not much arguing with the individual selections. Since it reshuffles the entire first side of You Shouldn't-Nuf Bit Fish, the most playable Clinton of the '80s if not all time, it's stronger cut for cut than that one, and it's a better dance record than Atomic Dog. But it's totally lacking in epistemological integrity, and if you think that's a ridiculous thing to say about a funk album, you've got placebo syndrome--George knows what I'm talking about, and without a dictionary.

Listening to their long-gone live double is like sitting midway back in the Garden because the fun is atmospheric: familiar epiphanies rise up out of the smoke, leaving the roof intact. This budget-priced one-sided video soundtrack offers a healthy serving of '70s raunch from about Row H of a hot '80s show--intense bottom, vocals loud and clear. Second side's a compilation, leading from ""Atomic Dog"" to two rereleases that'll make friends for Some of My Best Jokes. For fans, obviously.

Two and a half hours that confound my capacity for quantification. Some of the funk is standard-issue ass-bounce, many of the femme cameos are piss breaks, the slow ones run down; there's too much throwaway, experiment, and crap. But four long tracks are as remarkable as any Clinton of the past two decades: the so-funky-you-can-smell-it ""Something Stank,"" the Jerry Lee/Danny &amp; the Juniors medley ""Whole Lotta Shakin',"" ""I Can Dance"" and its stripper shit-talk, ""Viagra""'s too-fucking-hard speed-metal.

Alone among the great '50s vocal groups, the Coasters didn't sing protosoul--didn't invest pop sentiment with spiritual transport. Instead, Leiber &amp; Stoller crafted teen mini-sagas that exploited the cartoonish edge of Carl Gardner's sharp tenor and Bobby Nunn's (later Dub Jones's) broad bass. Yet performance--which for Leiber &amp; Stoller also signified production--can carry the music when the composition isn't at its familiar peak of idiomatic brilliance. Except for the delectably prefeminist ""Lady Like"" and the macho-busting ""Three Cool Cats,"" the lyrics of this arcana aren't fully worthy of the canon, but ""Wait a Minute"" and ""Gee Golly"" get by on vocal effects alone.

Cockburn is like a smart, nice, but not especially hip/cool English prof--if he caps ""Mama Just Wants to Barrelhouse All Night Long"" with ""Lord of the Starfields,"" just how raunchy is his barrelhouse likely to be? I'll take smart and nice over hip/cool anytime, and this best-of showcases his conventional wisdom at its most eloquent--you'll never catch the Devil taunting John Denver with an ecstatic ""Why don't we celebrate?""

An impressive document, but the same overkill (eleven musicians plus nine backup singers) that was so exhilarating live wears a little thick over a double-LP, especially when you compare the four repeats from Cocker's two studio albums--he sings more accurately when nobody's rushing him.

Not to be confused with 1969's classic Joe Cocker!, a distinction that gets at the difference quite nicely. It's said that Cocker's voice is gone, and I suppose that's true--it was never much less rough, but it was richer and more flexible. And the live ""Do Right Woman"" on side two is an overstated embarrassment. But the music on side one, with Chris Stainton providing the same old propulsion on piano as well as--hmm--collaborating with this supposed interpreter-only on some good-to-terrific songs, is as rollicking as ever, and the rest of side two is OK. The magic is gone, that's for sure, but maybe it's gone from us, not from him.

It's strange to encounter Cohen in the company of a large group--when he leads a thirteen minute singalong based on a blind man's placard he risks turning into the Pete Seeger of romantic existentialism. And I could do without the shaky guitar improv and the revival of ""Passing Thru,"" though both are tolerable. But it so happens that all five of the self-covers on this album are from Songs From a Room, which I've always thought could use redoing. And eventually the singalong becomes a yellalong, which is much better.

With a new crop of beautiful losers arising out of the latest bohemia as inexorably as ailanthus out of a vacant lot, the man who wrote the book is worth attending, because he's not bitter. After all, righteous anger has never been his long suit, and what does he have to be bitter about? At fifty, he's still living comfortably off the fruits of his spiritual torment. Of course, not every loser is so talented, or resilient, The hymn ""If It Be Your Will"" and the fable ""The Captain"" are as rich and twisted as anything in his career, and ""The Law"" does justice to his patented romantic irony, which by now has a soothing glow. If you're sick of hearing him whisper in your ear that to be a roue is a religious calling, so be it--me, I think this is a better advertisement for middle-aged sex than Dynasty.

Exercise lubricated his voice for a while, but it's dried out again. And when you're croaking the way Cohen is croaking--pun actively regretted, Cohen if anyone has earned the right to call his impending death by however dignified a name he deems appropriate--it takes more than a corps of angels and a Quebecquois Madonna collaborator to turn your verse into song. I admire and when I concentrate enjoy most of these tracks, in particular the spiritually advanced ""You Got Me Singing,"" the fondly remembered ""My Oh My,"" and the consciously complicit ""Almost Like the Blues."" But the only one I love is ""Slow,"" which is not about how considerately he makes love if that's what he's making these days. It's about how unhurriedly he approaches the death that impends for us all.

Smart about abortion's complexities and MLK's infidelities and weed's propensities, so aware of how ""mornin'"" spawns ""moanin'"" and ""wet shit"" swallows ""next shit"" that the sex rhymes hit a nerve, toned up by Drake and Jay-Z's 16s not to mention Trey Songz's and Missy Elliott's hooks, he's worth the shot Jay couldn't resist giving him.

FALSE,B+,Born Sinner,J Cole,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16023,"
You can see why this diligent St. John's magna tops off his make-or-break with the apologetic ""Let Nas Down""--the totemic rapper he betrayed, apparently, by tacking the harmless banger ""Work Out"" onto Cole World, as if Nas rechristening himself Escobar wasn't five times as cheap. Conceptually, this album is an Illmatic move. Musically it's fancied up as it must be from the spare skills of his three mixtapes. But like Illmatic it eschews pop emoluments, and conceptually it's just as canny. Craving street cred while rejecting crime as a hustle or a metaphor, the young man who ""couldn't sell crack but I rap good"" plays the mack daddy. But just as the younger Nas is fascinated by the pitfalls of a corner-boy lifestyle he's not quite part of, this ambitious youngblood is a chronically repentant horndog. Most of his sex songs are also apologies--to a wife or girlfriend, to the women he discards, to other women wronged by other dogs, he varies the theme with winning empathy. But I still prefer him class-conscious: spitting ""I hate richniggaz goddammit/'Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit"" and ending all but one of ""Mo Money""'s 24 quick lines with the M-word. On ""Crooked Smile,"" he combines the two themes hauntingly and elusively--helped big time by the historically pop women of TLC.

A Glaswegian whose romanticism mixes the mundane and the pretentious in nice lyrical proportions, Cole is like a middle-class Roddy Frame escaped to university instead of the bohemian fringe. Born just before the Beatles made it respectable for college kids to like beat music, he claims student life as the rock and roll subject it so obviously is, and I say about time. So what if he can't stop talking about books and movies and gathers his material on day trips from his walkup flat? Does that make him so different from you?

Released 1969 and 1972, Ornette's lost Impulse albums were recorded live at Berkeley May 1968 and NYU March 1969. Dewey Redman's tenor sax roughs up the alto/trumpet/violin-wielding leader, Charlie Haden bows darkly more than he plucks staunchly, and the drummer is 12-year-old Denardo, rumbling irrepressibly all over nine titles that are sometimes also tunes--""New York"" and ""Broken Shadows"" cross-referential, ""Song for Ch"" a dirge to remember. It sounds good because what Ornette doesn't? But you hardly notice Don Cherry returning on the second album, and while you can hear what a magnificent player Denardo will become, he's here partly because he isn't yet--Ornette wanted a bottom more untethered than the mere magnificence a grooving Ed Blackwell would soon provide on 1970's Friends and Neighbors. The late '60s were politically turbulent times, and good for Ornette for trying to tell the truth about them. But in the end, that wasn't the kind of truth that set him free.

Fortunately, the next next goes for the bare live bones, with the classic ""Frosty"" establishing a bite and authority that are never relinquished. I miss that down-home wit, though--giving your bass player room for a hornpipe is the kind of dumb joke that's afflicted live albums for years.

Me, I think ""Dance Critters"" is a mean antiboogie and ""A Different Bob"" a different cheatin' song, and direct your attention to ""Considering a Move to Memphis,"" where Colorblind expects to bowl, speak in tongues, visit Graceland, eat piroshkis, and (most important) get to know Gus Cannon.

Half of this belated testament was recorded CBGB 1978, a final track Hurrah 1980. But I'd never heard of them, and when I checked with New York Rocker's Andy Schwartz, he remembered only the name. On the evidence of these 16 homages to first-growth Talking Heads, from long before it was determined that the world moved on a woman's hips, we were missing something: the halting yet propulsive, arty yet catchy ejaculations of the uptight nerd as subversive geek. A five-year-old sex fiend joins suburban tennis players exposing their underthings join two straight songs about kitchens join the incendiary ""Old People"": ""Get out in the streets/Turn over cars/Elbow young people/Set garbage on fire.""

Common raps about black life as most black people live it and black manhood as most young black men grow into it, and while his flow isn't primed for the dance floor, it's complex and full-bodied in a way few, you know, white artists could imitate, much less make up.

Protest songs are hard to nail even in the moment, and I can't promise that the three bull's-eyes here will sound as dead on in five years, or one. Cooder's innovation is reapplying the Popular Front mindset to the messy compromises of electoral politics, and all the must-hears illuminate the 2012 presidential election rather than merely referencing it: ""Mutt Romney Blues,"" where the Republican standard bearer does to his dog precisely what he'll do to us; ""Cold Cold Feeling,"" where a black man in the White House details his blues; and especially ""The 90 and the 9,"" where the singer explains why he's repurposing that gospel song about this may be the last time. ""Going to Tampa"" slaps on too broad a burlesque, ""Guantanamo"" wanders off message, and others just don't twist the screw tight enough. But I give him extra credit for both preaching to the converted and doing his damnedest to rally the holier-than-thou.

They're hardly the first art band with a great rhythm section, but just like Pylon and the B-52's, they're fronted by a singer you remember--the slightly demented David Hanson, who does a beefcake variation on Fred Schneider's sharply campy attack. The four songs on their candid bid for wealth, fame, drugs, and wealth sort themselves out nicely. But except on a title number in which Hanson envies Sammy Davis Jr., Leroy Nieman, and Colonel Tom Parker--in which he longs to ""live like Elvis""--they do slide back to their primordial white funk bottom when you leave them alone.

Larry Coryell is the greatest thing to happen to the guitar since stretched gut. The permanent evidence of this has been sparse, however--a bad record with the Free Spirits, timid ones with Gary Burton, a somewhat over-avant performance on the Jazz Composer's Orchestra set, and an inspired chorus here or there with jazz-rock leaders like Steve Marcus and Don Sebeskey. This is far more satisfying but still crabbed and uneven. It includes some wonderfully funny wah-wah work alongside apparent homages to Wes Montgomery, near-parody singing alongside a couple of tracks (one composed by Coryell and featuring Elvin Jones, one composed by Junior Walker) that approach the soaring pyrotechnics Coryell can produce when he is good live. Recommended.

Coryell has been the jazz rock hope since founding the Free Spirits four years ago, so it's worth noting that his best record to date sounds mostly unimprovised. The title of ""Elementary Guitar Solo #5"" describes it perfectly--an unsurprising, fairly deliberate progression of notes over the solid bottom of studio soul aces Chuck Rainey and Bernard Purdie, with Coryell's color, authority, and dynamics providing most of the ""jazz."" It's also worth noting that the most exciting track on the album does sound improvised--""The Jam with Albert"" (bassist Stinson). And that he's not singing a whole lot. And that he's still singing too much.

Between the first and last words of this working-trio album--""Welcome to the death of rock and roll"" and ""Bliss is all-eternal""--Coryell manages to play a lot of guitar, much of which (unlike the singing) sounds like rock and roll: themes over a steady beat. Even as an improvisor he's more into modal flights and electronic extravaganzas than inventing melodies off the changes. So ignore the rhetoric and face the music.

I like the nerdy way this guy comes on, I'm fascinated by his lyrics, and I approve of his rock and roll orientation; in fact, I got quite obsessive about his two cuts on the Bunch of Stiff Records import. Yet odd as it may seem, I find that he suffers from Jackson Browne's syndrome--that is, he's a little boring.

Without the sustained melodicism of Imperial Bedroom (first side, anyway) to impart the illusion of meaningful wholeness, this is adjudged a major letdown by Elvis's acolytes. But ""Boxing Day"" is hardly the first time one of his punderous constructions has failed not just to signify but to communicate. Most of this disparate collection (first side, anyway) does what he's always done--convey an elusive feeling that's half pinned down by the words because that's all the grasp he's got on it. And though the alternate versions of ""Shipbuilding"" (Robert Wyatt) and ""Pills and Soap"" (the Imposter) are indeed more gripping, their literalness does place his personal contortions in useful perspective.

Pieced together in 1997 from impulsively conceived, doggedly recorded scraps of DAT and four-track by Austin mastermind Robert Harrison and a Memphis tape wizard who loved how Big Star the band was, Cotton Mather's second album caught the attention of some British Beatles fanatics d/b/a Oasis, who brought them over to open and even generated some U.K. sales. While allowing his vocal resemblance to ""John Lennon with a Southern accent and a head cold,"" Harrison's extensive notes don't cite the Beatles much even though ""My Before and After"" resembles ""Ticket to Ride"" more than its supposed inspiration ""(Reach Out) I'll Be There"" and ""Private Ruth"" echoes ""For No One"" straight up. Harrison is no more a genius than Noel Gallagher, so though the lyrics aren't spaced-out gibberish or obvious pap, they're unequal to the music--which definitely beats, for instance, the last three songs on the first Big Star album, and even more remarkable, kind of makes you appreciate Oasis.

In addition to balancing the instruments, the remixes add a few decorative flourishes, and as a Crenshaw fanatic I've already put them on a special tape. Did I get it free? You bet. What do you take me for--a collector?

FALSE,B+,Life's Too Short,Marshall Crenshaw,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2273,"
By now there's comfort in his surprising little modulations as well as his plain-spoken prosody, and it's nigh on 10 years since he collected so many strong songs; heard live, ""Better Back Off"" and ""Don't Disappear Now"" seem no less inevitable than ""Cynical Girl"" or ""Whenever You're on My Mind."" But even if he finally gets his just market share, the new converts won't sing the same praises as the original faithful, because by now his feeling for his craft runs to weary wisdom rather than brimming delight. Marshall's compact solos and Kenny Aronoff's firm beat reinforce his resolve without hinting at his grace.

FALSE,B+,Photographs and Memories,Jim Croce,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6653,"
Death hasn't changed this engaging, rather repetitious minor artist into a genius, but it's reminded us why he was (and is) engaging. His short-haul trucker persona (world-weary machismo with a heart of gold and a soul of beaten copper) and detached lowlife portraiture (he doesn't mess around that much with Jim himself) were a relief from post-hippie confessionalism, and his music was sweet and tough, never an easy combo to bring off. But like so many tough guys, he does get mawkish--only ""Operator"" adds insight as well as terse melody to our romantic mythology--and though his four albums do include a few good songs that didn't make it onto this fourteen-track compilation, they're enough like those that did that you can live without them.

An excellent joke in which a man out of tunes, utilizing croaking vocals and some well-placed banjo, transforms Kristofferson, Springsteen, Prince, and even Neil Diamond (""Solitary Man,"" Johnny Cash named an album after it) into alt-country all-depressives. And when he does the same for Queen-Bowie, the dolor is too funny to laugh off.

The cutting nasality of Crow's vocals is revivalism at its finest--he's not an original like Ray Benson, but he's got the style down. And as a swinging eclectic he borrows anything he likes, from the Cleftones to a dope-running epic to ""Turkey, Texas (Home of Bob Wills)."" Stop off in Turkey first. But if you like it there, put this on your Christmas list right after Asleep at the Wheel.

I used to assume they were just a good little band who'd latched onto a great little song, but while their new white-funk rhythms are superfluous and none of the tunes is ""My Boyfrield,"" I'm beginning to think they could go national.

Rick Rubin meets the doom fops of the former Southern Death Cult and concocts the metal dreams are made of--Zep for our time, supposedly. One reason it's a great joke is that in 2087 almost nobody will be able to tell it from the real thing. The other reason it's a great joke is that right now almost anybody can. Direct comparison reveals that Jimmy Page's thunderclap riffs, Robert Plant's banshee yowls, and John Bonham's ka-boom ka-boom are just as hard to replicate as you thought they were. I hear Steppenwolf (an unconvincing ""Born to Be Wild""), Cream (""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" as ""Aphrodisiac Jacket""), and Aerosmith--fop but no fool, Ian Astbury apes Steve Tyler rather than the unapproachable Plant. I also hear lots of Zep simplified--no sagas, no tempo shifts, no blues. Inspirational Verse: ""Zany antics of a beat generation/In their wild search for kicks.""

""Crack in New York,"" about Manley's war on ganja, almost gloats. Inspirational Cackle: ""Even professionals get spoiled by it too (hah!).""

Boy George really doesn't sound like Smokey Robinson, you know--not the way Frankie Miller sounds like Otis Redding, not even the way John Cougar sounds like Bruce Springsteen. If he did, he could probably put this tuneful collection all the way over--Smokey's spiritual gravity has redeemed some pretty lightweight lyrics, so this sensual specificity might just salvage some vague ones. As it is, George's warm, well-meaning, slightly clumsy croon signifies most effectively when it has the least to say--when it's most purely a medium for his warm, well-meaning, slightly clumsy self. Just like Helen Terry, who packs the voice of Merry Clayton into the body of Gertrude Stein, his real aim in life is to reenact the story of the ugly duckling--and to radiate the kind of extreme tolerance that's so often engendered by extreme sexual ambiguity.

Stephen Holden thinks kids liked Boy George's singing more than I did because he evoked not a soul man but a synthesizer. Right: a synthesizer who wants to be your friend. His music is too nice to withstand much critical scrutiny, which means he's best when he puts a vaguely dishy edge on his female-identified pansexual humanitarianism: ""Karma Chameleon,"" ""Church of the Poison Mind,"" ""Black Money."" And the topper is ""The War Song,"" which contributed more conspicuously to his U.S. downfall than mere heroin abuse. ""War is stupid/And people are stupid""--now is that nice?

The DIY/XXX rapper's 2017 breakthrough album starts with some street sociology and an earned brag before returning to the ""fuckin'-for-a-check"" rhymes that remain the bliss point of an irrepressible rhymer who never slurs a phrase or swallows a word. But the clincher is ""Biggie Smalls,"" one of several tracks that prove her heart is as big as the rest of her: not just ""Stretch marks in a bikini, I'm that damn brave"" but ""fuck dude if he don't like small boobs,"" because ""Big or small, it's who you are."" After which, right, it's back to ""Pay the damn price or go home to your wife."" But that's who she is whether or not it's who she'll remain.

The sound is dry postpunk, with touches of Wire's spare, arty melodicism, more Pink Flag than 154. Never pretty, it's treated with a properly mnemonic pop overlay--scan the titles and you'll recall a phrase from all but a few of these thirteen songs. Intelligent phrases they are, too. Yet what are we to think of a band whose best song is based on Albert Camus's The Stranger, a book that was holy writ for collegiate existentialists before Robert Smith was even born? The last thing we need is collegiate existentialism nostalgia.

Caught in his least lugubrious moments, Robert Smith stands revealed as a guy who gets a lot of skin because he believes he can live without it. He just won't play the ""stupid game"" that hooks the definitive ""Let's Go to Bed,"" with its rotating I-don't-if-you-don't challenges--care, feel, want it, say it, and of course play it (and now let's go to bed, it's getting late). Guys who don't make passes because they wear glasses hate him for this, as do guys who don't get laid despite their muscular bods and heads. Above the fray, I think he's kind of amusing myself--a real cool type.

Considering how cheap they are to produce, jazz combo records like this one are shamefully rare, and even when they're tightly conceived and not excessively earthbound (not just Grover Washington but Joe Henderson) or ethereal (not just Mahavishnu but Kenny Wheeler) it's rare yet that they're as melodic, economical, and fraught with small pleasures as this one.

FALSE,B+,Blues at Montreux,King Curtis and Champion Jack Dupree,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6667,"
Because great stylists aren't always great improvisers, and because great accompanists are only occasionally great leaders, even the music Curtis intended for LP release was marred by a certain marginal-differentiation monotony (his posthumous concert albums are even worse). And though Dupree, as one of Europe's resident Real Blues Singers, makes it into all kinds of collectors' series, his recent recordings have been forgettable. This LP cancels out the dross--just when Dupree's call gets redundant, Curtis responds with his saxophone. Like most live dates it lacks compression, and Dupree is old enough for his voice to be changing again, but this is a pleasant surprise.

FALSE,B+,Cymande,Cymande,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6668,"
What they call Nyah-rock is African with Jamaican influences--not straight reggae so much as Rastafarian by which I mean that a lot of the songs seem designed to give off a tribal aura. The groove is slow but very seductive, and while the improvisations aren't exciting as such, they're very satisfying rhythmically. The borrowed folk chants are exciting as such.

Long on hooks and cameos, the Wild Bunch DJ's mix tape connects by the crude expedient of not proving how obscure his crates are.

Dama is a classic folkie, a cosmopolitan leftist credited with inventing Malagasy nueva cancion, an elected legislator as renowned in Madagascar as Victor Jara was in Chile. D'Gary is a classic find, a prodigy-prot������������������g������������������ from cattle country where the main road is an 11-hour walk away. Though their rainbow rhythms are formally unique and patently pleasurable, not even producer Henry Kaiser claims to apprehend them fully. The hook is D'Gary's distinctively Malagasy way with his recently acquired guitar, and even more, since that wasn't enough to put his solo album over, Dama's calm, good-humored, deeply assured vocal presence--a politician's gift from a place and time where oratory is still entertainment.

Danny is Green on Red's Dan Stuart, a likable fool, Dusty the Dream Syndicate's Steve Wynn, a pretentious wise guy, and with the help of some L.A. drinking buddies they've come up with an album less ambitious and more satisfying than any either band has produced on its own. It makes a concept of the loser mythology that's such a big deal in L.A., and I was prepared to hate it--I've never believed that ""we've all gotta go down."" But the songs are relaxed, unassuming, and funny. I guess if the Heartbreakers could make heroin addiction sound like a good time, these guys have a right to do the same for alcoholism--they certainly have tradition behind them.

Though the 59-year-old jazzman sired Nas and references the ""embryonic state of the hip hop,"" for him that was ""young children's music."" And please, he's no ""griot."" Dara mines a more class- and nation-specific cultural mode: Afrocentric local color in the manner of PBS and Black History Month (release date: February 20). But where 1998's In the World proceeded directly to limbo on the rough-hewn cobblestones of its noble intentions, here he gets somewhere. More direct rhythmically, more considerate melodically, discerningly observed and recalled until it gets all poetic on our ass, this is at least as educational as Maya Angelou, and much more fun. One thing, though. Dara's warm trumpet tone is compared to Roy Eldridge's. You think maybe he could learn to sing with Little Jazz's nonchalant authority? We wish.

He can sing sweet or gritty, write sweet, gritty, or pretentious. His rhythms and arrangements show a sense of roots and a sense of style. He's got black consciousness and pop ambition.

Second generation hip comedy. The third time I listened to this record, the first side destroyed the two comedy albums I'd just heard--it includes the best ever Woodstock, Cheech &amp; Chong &amp; FM radio bits. It's very subtle, though, no yock-yocks. Potential.

In which the first man to record ""Green Green Grass of Home"" and ""Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp"" makes something of the literate modern-country approach typified by Mickey Newbury. Among his finds: two songs by Nico's favorite Orange County poet, Jackson Browne, and ""Willing,"" which keeps on trucking. Unfortunately, Darrell sounds too sensitive to project the kind of dumb authority that puts corny puns like ""Bed of Roses"" across, and the two songs from coproducer Larry Murray are irredeemable. But old folkie away from home Dick Rosmini is Murray's better half, and Clarence White picks real good.

But it'll sure stick to your ribs longer than what Jon Spencer stewed up with R.L.

FALSE,B+,On the Corner,Miles Davis,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6681,"
Because the tracks are very short, because Miles plays more organ than trumpet and not much of that, and because the improvisations are rhythmic rather than melodic--often on a theme from ""It's Your Thing"" that I'm not swearing the Isleys (much less Davis) invented--most jazzbos have thrown up their hands at this one. Well, poo on jazzbos. But that's no reason for rockbos to sing hosanna to the highest--rhythmic improvisations are hardly the equivalent of a big beat and don't guarantee a good one.

Double whammy. Not only isn't this new Miles, as people were quick to figure out despite the pseudo-streetwise On the Corner-style cover, but it isn't quite vintage Miles, either. Recorded in the late '60s, these were outtakes, and one of them--""Dual Mr. Tillman Anthony,"" a thirteen-minute piano ostinato showcase without even the justification of a heavy funk beat--should definitely have remained one. The rest is better, but I thank CBS's marketing whizzes for sending me back to Davis's great work with the same group--like Sorcerer and Nefertiti, both still in catalogue.

Miles tastes better out of the can than fresh watermelon or even V.S.O.P., but these tapes, mostly from when he was working out his '70s concept a decade or so ago, are damaged goods. Oddity: David Crosby's ""Guinnevere,"" itself based on a three-note motif from Sketches of Spain.

Like so many groove albums, this one is now-you-hear-it now-you-don't. But once you learn to live with the synthesizer colors of Robert Irving III, the only weak link in the band the leader's been forging since his comeback, you stop worrying about why he's making a conventional fusion record and realize that between his own muscle-mouth and John Scofield's sweet-and-sour licks and the quite audible Jones-Foster pulse he's made a pretty damn good conventional fusion record.

Miles's endgame at Columbia was true fusion--improvised jazz-rock, pretty good of its sort, but what a sort. This is more like pop-funk Sketches of Spain, with the starperson's trumpet glancing smartly off an up-to-date panoply of catchy little tunes, beats, and rhythm effects. I cried fraud at first, and if you have no use for catchy little anythings you'll agree, but I changed my mind. Marcus Miller acquits himself in the Gil Evans role, George Duke gets off a nice lick, and Scritti Politti provides a snappier cover than Cyndi Lauper. Minor, and his best in a decade.

Fewer than half of the 42 tracks are previously unreleased--dark magus Teo Macero broke up and relocated most of the others onto Live-Evil, Big Fun, Get Up With It, the obscure late catchall Directions, and, yes, A Tribute to Jack Johnson, the landmark album that climaxes this five-disc collector's indulgence. Outfitted with the usual pricey packaging and elaborate notes, it's ""complete"" only if the four missing ""Duran""s, 15 missing ""Nem Um Talvaez""s, etc., were false starts. But it's a mother of a motherlode. I'm glad Macero imposed his sense of form on Miles's '70s experiments, and definitely don't need the Bitches Brew box. But though the ""Go Ahead John"" Macero pieced together for Big Fun gets the good bits, I'd rather listen to the raw material that takes up 45 minutes of disc two. Though the multiple Hermeto Pascoal takes add up to a quiet disc four, they're as soothing as they wanna be. With major input from John McLaughlin and the bass tandem of Dave Holland and Michael Henderson, these jams were why electric jazz was once a thrilling idea--and still is sometimes.

Too bad Dawson's DIY imprint is above the Deluxe Edition hustle, because tracks 13 to 16 are ""bonus"" yuck at its most useless. Yuckiest of all is the insipid anarcho-pastoral finale ""Utopian Futures,"" which dreams an ideal world that would in fact lack--among many things I enjoy, such as non-DIY CDs--the library system she celebrates so heartily right before the album's true climax, the inspirational memoir of vanquished dysfunction ""Walk Like Thunder."" Oh well. She's 37 now, married and a mom, and like most aging hippies can be a crank or a lump--in her case, usually the former. So be glad her gift for whimsy and/or confessional lifts most of what we'll call the ""real"" album. Highlights include the pregnancy report ""All I Could Do,"" the literary reflection ""Miami Advice,"" and an ecumenically non-utopian protest song called ""Same Shit/Complicated""--to which I will merely add that Madison, Wisconsin isn't the only place with some nice cops.

To my surprise, this Chuck Berry look-alike and birds-and-bees sound-alike qualifies as another minor LA r&amp;b novelty auteur. His original ""Little Bitty Pretty One"" may not cut Thurston Harris's, but his original ""Over and Over"" deserves to outlast Dave Clark's and when he got desperate for a lyrical hook sometimes he came up with a ""Teenage Philosopher"" or a ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rock and Roll.""

A man of simple tastes, I'm thrown into a tizzy when I find myself uninterested in playing an album comprising twelve tunes I can hum after a dozen plays. I think it's because they're so prepossessing they short-circuit my simple aesthetic sense. I was thrown off for weeks, to take one example, by the soul horns that open the lead cut. They sounded fussy. Soul horns. On a pop record. Overreaching.

Just like Howard Stern says, it's tough being funny every time out, but at least they're in there pitching, hurling sophomoric knuckleballs at every freshman in sight. Though they've picked up some sarcasm at the feet of Camper Van, pop gothic remains their thing, from the '60s to Graceland to exploitation flicks to Anglodisco ""art fags,"" an epithet I'm sure Mark Knopfler will find hilarious.

For a while there I thought they'd scored a comedy album worthy of their IQs--its forward motion makes them sound like kids again. But they're such shallow little doofuses that the jokes only stick when they're aimed at the right targets, always a subjective call.

The elemental runs a lot deeper for this Jack White-Dean Fertita vehicle than for their secret sharers Queens of the Stone Age. Just as in the Delta blues they adore, even fewer songs here than on the debut will mean much cut adrift from this particular musical realization. Nevertheless, I heartily recommend ""The Difference Between Us"" to whoever wants it--the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, mayhap?

Whitney Balliett's notes compare her to Bobby Short, high praise from him but anathema if, like me, you think Short's show of class epitomizes what contemporary singing ought to avoid. Fortunately, Dearie has the grace to understate her high technique; she sounds like an emotionally substantial Astrud Gilberto. I can't think of a rock singer who could tiptoe so sure-footedly through these melodies, much less make them up, and if lyrical ploys about ""velvet wine"" are uncomfortably reminiscent of Nancy Sinatra, well, that's what happens when you sing for your supper club.

Having outlived their modishness, the biracial art-rap-cum-ragecore trio release a double album that, as I once requested, sidesteps their sex-hating/fearing misogyny. This they achieve not by putting it aside altogether but by sticking it on one disc, based musically on ""Bj����������"" har har, epitomized thematically by ""Have a Sad Come BB"" (pronounced ""baby""), and entitled for confusion's sake Niggas on the Moon. Its longer opposite number, entitled for confusion's sake Jenny Death, is epitomized thematically by a breakneck Humvee of an opener called ""Break Mirrors With My Face in the United States."" They couldn't have anticipated Freddie Gray except in the sense that there'll always be another, the rare ragecore truism with undeniable truth value. But in this time of racist callousness, I find their all-purpose hostility and alienation apt and, sometimes, perversely satisfying--on ""Pss Pss,"" ""Centuries of Dawn,"" ""Beyond Alive.""

They came from nowhere with an airy debut that never touched ground or stopped coming, and nowhere is where it went. So this time they go against their own best instincts, bearing down on individual compositions rather than immersing themselves in sound. When they hit one--slow stuff like ""All This Love"" and ""I Like It"" is why the Lord blessed them--you can hear it breaking through and crossing over, always the Motown ideal. When they don't, all you hear is exquisitely cautious product.

Eldra DeBarge's genius isn't especially with-it--uptempo arrangements do nothing for his outstretched melodies and chilly harmonies. But he and his countless siblings scored one hit after another off In a Special Way, which led to a traumatic tour with the unsinkable Luther Vandross when Eldra might have been working up new product. Hence this mishmash--a Richard Perry-produced soundtrack one-off, a Giorgio Moroder-produced soundtrack one-off, a 1981 ballad featuring Eldra and sister Bunny in their classic falsetto mode, four standard medium-fasts from C-list funk-popper Jay Graydon, and two uptempo numbers from Eldra, who seems to be getting a handle on the stuff. Pray the paranoia underlying his all-too-interesting ""The Walls (Come Tumbling Down)"" dissipates when he settles into the studio again.

With his solo debut an old stiff, several lesser siblings convicted cocaine traffickers, and Uncle Berry passed on to his corporate reward, this is black pop on a beeline for the cutout bins, which I guess means it isn't really black pop at all. Just good black music, ancient to the future, all jumping rhythms and space-case melody, less catchy song than gorgeous sound. Can't say maturity's done him a damn bit of good.

But from Ellington copyright to Okinawan golden oldie, other descriptives also pertain--open, surprising, catchy.

Well after soukous supposedly withered away, a second-tier crowd-pleaser with a willingness to throw his big body into a dance he named puts out his 17th or 18th album, something like that. Vocally he's no Wemba or Rochereau, but Manda Chante (of Wenge Musica, how did you miss him?) caramelizes one track, and Le Jeune Makuta, Likanga Mangenza, and others I've never heard of take guest turns. Vocal colors shift as leads come and go; the chorus expands and contracts. Rhythms converge, thin out, flow horizonward. A saxophone comes in to garnish the guitars. Songs segue for easier dancing, or divide into parts the dancers better be ready for. The jollity is general, audible. A generic good time is had by all.

At twenty-eight, Joseph Bowie comes on as spoiled and stunted as the most solipsistic hardcore teen, so it says worlds for the power of his rhythm section and the imagination of his guitarists that he can't ruin his own music. More Ornette than Contortions this time, he even shows off his good breeding by funkifying a Charlie Parker tune. On the other hand, his ""For the Love of Money"" sounds like slumming, especially from a guy who couldn't outsing Kenny Gamble in the shower.

Because this date by the former Miles Davis drummer features the protean Lester Bowie in a relatively muted frame of mind, comparisons are made to In a Silent Way. But guitarist John Abercrombie is more like an anti-intellectual Bill Evans (bassist Eddie Gomez's mentor, by the way) than like John McLaughlin. And DeJohnette's heads don't match Davis's and Zawinul's on Silent Way any more than DeJohnette himself matches Tony Williams. For all that, a lot warmer than most of what this label seems to think is jazz, especially on side two.

Now that Eric and George have given their imprimature, D&amp;B's first release, on Elektra, is beginning to sell as it should. This one was recorded much earlier, with Duck Dunn and Jack Nix producing instead of Leon Russell, but released much later. Perhaps if I heard it first I'd like it more--or rather, even more, since I already like it--but I don't think it compares to the Elektra album (rated A plus in an earlier CG). The warmth that suffuses their music is obscured more than once by some perfunctory soul-shouting, and the arrangements are less than inventive. Nice enough, though.

After almost four years, Posdnuos and company emerge from the ether like the long-lost friends they are. Their wordplay assured in its subtle smarts, their delivery unassuming in its quick, unmacho mumble, their cultural awareness never smug about its balance, they bind up an identifiable feeling in an identifiable sound, and just about every one of the 17 tracks comes equipped with a solid beat and a likable hook or chorus.

Because it leads with the miraculous ""Let the Mystery Be""--an agnostic's declaration of faith so homespun it makes the word agnostic seem absurdly hoity-toity and severe, so unfaltering it modestly conceals the tremendous intellectual effort her decision not to know self-evidently required--this Kansas City 31-year-old's debut has authenticity hounds in a lather. But she never gets so near perfection again--the catchy ""Our Town"" seems contrived by comparison, the signature ""Infamous Angel"" obscure. Also, she worries more about her sins than an agnostic should. It's hard to believe she's ever done anything that bad.

Their second half-assed compilation in a year and a half finally gets it half right, putting a single sleeve around their most tuneful technotopia and death-fluff. Granted, it omits their only actual U.S. hit, ""People Are People,"" already reprised to bait the dire Some Great Reward, baiting instead with the previously un-American Everything Counts EP, which holds up indifferently in such select company, though the squishy ""Fly on the Windscreen"" bookends the blasphemous ""Blasphemous Rumors"" neatly enough. But the collection has a structure, proceeding chronologically from young technotopian romance to slightly older technodystopian despair. First they ""Just Can't Get Enough,"" then they ponder ""The Meaning of Love,"" then they doubt ""Love in Itself,"" then they play ""Master and Servant."" The little girls understand.

When Vince Clarke departed Yazward in 1982, Fashion-in-a-Hurry's commercial doom was presumed sealed, whereupon Martin Gore went ahead and proved how easy it is to write ditties once you're in a position to exploit them. It's not as if anybody can, but at this point in pop's progress potential supply far exceeds potential demand. Yet only rarely is the production process altogether mechanical. Gore can't create without venting his shallow morbidity, which happens to mesh with a historically inevitable strain of adolescent angst, and he takes himself seriously enough to have burdened albums with concept and such. This time, however, the title announces his determination to give it up to his even shallower singer, David Gahan, who likes Gore's message because it's a good way to impress girls. Dark themes combine with light tunes until the very end of side two. Anybody with an interest in adolescent angst (adolescents included) can sob or giggle along as the case may be.

Migrating to Ghana from Dahomey in 1955 to become a highlife star in the '60s, the trumpeter's selling point was his Francophone roots, which gave him a leg up on those newfangled Congolese rhythms. He wasn't above the occasional twist or cha-cha either. Initially these 19 cuts sound pleasingly familiar but not all that distinctive, on the cusp between the generic-elemental and the generic-cliched. Yet although my highlife comp of choice remains the same label's more obscure, more exacting Azagas and Archibogs, slowly the pleasure wins out.

With Daniel Bejar's latest band sound already compared to everything from Aja and Avalon to late New Order, I'll take, um--Pet Shop Boys! Forgoing the rock expressionism he lacks the heart or chops for, Bejar bends Neil Tennant's bemused calm toward an acerbic subtlety suitable for deflecting one's historical anomie. Mix in a smoove groove suitable for deflecting others' disinterest in one's historical anomie and you have intelligent lounge music for 21st-century depressives. The X factor is trumpeter JP Carter, who no one will mistake for Chuck Mangione because he's there not for jazz cred but to stick it to the guitars Bejar lacks the heart and chops to stand up against.

The Emeralds are stay-at-home Spinners, and Abrim Tilmon, who writes (and helps sing) their material and is credited with coarranging an album that lists no producer or personnel, is Thom Bell without an instinct for the killer hook.

If this isn't Kiss for college kids, then it's Meat Loaf for college kids who are too sophisticated to like Meat Loaf. Aside from music per se, the Kiss connection is in their cartoonishness--Devo's robot moves create distance, a margin of safety, the way Kiss's makeup does. But the Meat Loaf connection is deeper, because this is real midnight-movie stuff--the antihumanist sci-fi silliness, the reveling in decay, the thrill of being in a cult that could attract millions and still seem like a cult, since 200 million others will never even get curious. (It's no surprise to be told that a lot of their ideas come from Eraserhead, but who wants to go see Eraserhead to make sure?) What makes this group worthy of attention at all--and now we're back with Kiss, though at a more complex level--is the catchy, comical, herky-jerky rock and roll they've devised out of the same old basic materials. In small doses it's as good as novelty music ever gets, and there isn't a really bad cut on this album. But it leads nowhere.

Rather than romanticizing a righteous African sister, take her for a griot who's good at her job. In a nation where preserving musical treasure has been a point of socialist pride, her adept, folky elaborations avoid the appearance of self-consciousness--the closely related guitar figures underlying these songs are graceful, welcome, inevitable.

And while I've loved the Gladiolas' goofy original of ""Little Darlin'"" ever since Alan Freed refused to play the Diamonds' in 1957, I have to admit that theirs is the classic. Attacking every target with a petty criminal's nervous intensity, they went all out on pure novelties--not only ""Little Darlin',"" but ""Daddy Cool"" and ""She Say (Oom Dooby Doom)""--and their frantic notion of fun says worlds about how rock and roll first hit the straightest white teenagers.

Hate to say this, but what makes Dibango's African dances so much catchier than those of the competition is that he's from a French part of the continent, which means he relates to the Caribbean--all of it--rather than to rock.

Since both records are more abstract than their cheering sections understand, the many voices Rock enlists make a difference. From Doom and Black Thought down to Phat Kat and Frank Nitty, they ground Dilla's beats where, for instance, the finished singles collected on Rapster's Dillanthology comp put them in the background where any pro knows they belong.

A meaningful title. Fifteen years ago, sweet-and-dirty New Orleans jive conveyed the same wry rebelliousness that Dr. John's night-tripping hoodoo did ten years later. These days he's purveying fifteen-year-old New Orleans jive himself, last time with his own band and classic songs, this time with a classic band--the Meters--and his own songs. Last time worked better, but producer Allen Toussaint, whose ""Life"" sounds terrific b/w Dr. John's own rakish ""Such a Night,"" gets this one over.

Dr. John does enunciate more piquantly than Frankie Miller or King Biscuit Boy, but this is basically another chance for Allen Toussaint to meet up with a white blues singer and groove all the way to the bank. Not that that's bad--these days it's my favorite subgenre, and this may be the best of them all. Despite the absence of a standout song (""Mos' Scocious"" is a great readymade) it's more fun than Right Place, Wrong Time. But it does lean toward the music-is-the-answer fallacy. Toussaint shouldn't write songs putting down those who fill their lives ""with money matters""--he's too wealthy. And Dr. John shouldn't sing them--he's too hip.

What a great gift idea--Stardust for r&amp;b weirdos who find Willie Nelson prosaic. Anything but straight, the ivory-tickling second-liner raids the pop songbook for hipper material than the richer outlaw, and has such a great time with Rickie Lee Jones you're sorry she has to leave--especially since his vocal poetry does wander on its own.

Wondering why these six slices of slide-guitar Americana cut through with such uncommon truth power, I learned that Jay Ward is a lifelong stutterer who escapes his prison not just by singing but by singing about his prison. Standin' at the edge of a dream gettin' ready to jump, nothing special in itself. Turnin' at the fork in the road, ditto. But ""I've got some tales on the tip of my tongue / Gettin' ready to speak""?

More or less totally destructive. The one-sided concept is hypochondria--what's the last soul album to use the word ""hyperventilation""? Side two leads off with the singer catching his wife in bed with another woman. By the way, I've finally figured out what his voice sounds like--an Afro-American air raid siren.

Worth finding for his liner notes alone (""Why does jury duty pay more than my job and why is it the only Joy I know is a dishwashing detergent?""), an unvanquished professional and hopeless eccentric goes sane. His voice won't fend off nuclear attack anymore, but from Shirley &amp; Lee to the Bellamy Brothers, from black history to rap, his vision of soul remains unique, and also remains a vision of soul.

Not so easy to describe this Seattle duo, so just say dance-pop performance art that dares Justin Timberlake to take SNL into the studio with him. The very silly third track ""Murderburger--Official Motion Picture Trailer"" suggests that their true calling is sketch comedy, but then the ""Laos! Laos! Laos!

One reason this band epitomizes corporate rock is that it has its meager merits, and I'm ashamed to say that on this compilation I enjoy them. In fact, the bassline hooks of ""China Grove"" and ""Long Train Runnin'"" move me so efficiently that by the time we get to ""Listen to the Music""--which with its easy-rolling rhythms, anonymous harmonies, countrified arrangement, meticulous production, and smug message made my ten-worst list in 1972--I'm still listening to the music.

KMD's reincarnated Zev Love X says his new handle starts with an abbreviation for Metal Face and is based on a Marvel villain who wants to rule the world for its own good. As concept, this could get tedious fast, but as a few skits it's one more scenic sonic on an album that reaches its high point when it samples not just the Scooby-Doo theme but Scoob himself, thus acknowledging that, as Scoob knows so well, some villains are just plain evil. Right, the album never comes into full focus. But it does flow, as music and as signifying. Message: this smart guy had some horrible setbacks and came out on the other side. A role model, you might say.

Doughty has never been tuneless. But he's better at lyrics than melody and better at declaiming than singing, which is one reason he foundered after he broke with the polyrhythmic Soul Coughing. It also explains why his old songs held up when he devised an alternatively polyrhythmic hipster hip-hop that he elaborated further for these new ones, breaking decisively with the trad band sound he settled for solo--backup more percussive and electronic, guests more rappers than singers. For the middle third of a 16-track album that lasts just 50 minutes, the lyrics have trouble filling in their title concepts. But everywhere he sounds at home. He's acerbic of course--he hasn't gone soft. But he's always credible, often thoughtful, and sometimes even spiritual.

Neither thug nor thug wannabe, he's plenty talented, but pretty shallow and without much focus as a mack. That's why his very first official album, pleasing and hookful though it be, consistently bemoans the confusing emoluments and accoutrements of fame. Given his limitations, his famous friends are a mixed benefit, because they show him up. Weezy schools him with wheezy jokes from jail. Nicki Minaj's nasty mouth comes as a turn-on. And Jay-Z's 16 takes up the self-doubt theme not to explore that narrow seam of his expanded consciousness but to show the young man how it's done: ""And since no good deed go unpunished/I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was/I once was cool as the Fonz was/But these bright lights turned me to a monster.""

But Steve Wynn's take on the usual world-weary table topics is gratifying matter-of-fact and no more, and music like this--music where the fun is in the no-fun--feels incomplete when it stops there.

A consistently listenable document of a documentably titanic live band. The only hedge is that it's front-loaded with most of the same songs that lead the band's greatest album, not that I ever mind hearing them again. Second half is a generous assortment that revs up the signature ""Puttin' People on the Moon"" with roughed-up Hood and Cooley solos, improves on the Cooley highlight from their weakest album, and updates Hood's deathless set piece ""18 Wheels of Love"" to bring the miracle into the present time--and also, you'll hope, the future.

These swampy genre pieces, spawned in the backwaters of the English pub scene and drawled with hush-moufed abandon by Sean Tyla (spelling phonetic?), are tuneful, affectionate, raunchy, and sometimes inspired--a lick here, a yell there, a concept somewhere else. but it's a lot harder for an English band that loves America by phonograph to tell us something about ourselves in 1974 than it was for a comparable band in 1964--especially since the 1974 band loves America's rural past, just like Ry Cooder.

The one that proves they really are P-Funk comes pretty early, however: ""Crooked Booty,"" which one doctor diagnosed and a better one prescribed.

Bowie does a song about international pop star Andy Warhol; more deeply cultured and deeply Brit, Dury does one for London pop visionary Peter Blake. His culture broad, informed, and utterly unhierarchical, his Britness rooted rather than snobbish or xenophobic, Dury has tended toward rock and roll music hall, but with the U.S. audience out of reach his music is drifting toward Europop cabaret, and sometimes his determination to ennoble the clich�������""I like you very much"" is preceded by a series of tropes that could have come out of a bad children's book and probably did.

There's not for everyone, and then there's this--Gary Lucas spelling Peter Stampfel on what started out a children's album and ended up half a children's album. Stampfel is a great singer only when both voice and heart are completely in it, and here sometimes he conveys more life than inspiration, maybe because even ""bad"" voices age. But Lucas's quick-pick guitar and groaned originals--however they began, ""Crawlspace"" and ""Sandman"" are children's songs now--tip the balance toward give-it-a-chance-willya. Includes a reeling ""Ring of Fire"" (""such a dirty song,"" murmurs Lucas, taken with the ""went down down down""), a postcanonical ""Rollin' Sea"" (""A wonderful place to hunt the snark/Or listen to the dogfish bark""), and three works of kidlike genius: the eight-year-old targeted ""Zoe's Song,"" the elaborately disgusting ""Rotten Family,"" and ""Captain Kidd,"" begun with Michael Hurley in 1963 about one Chris Lindsey, future Deacon of the Admirality of the Fellowship of the Sea.

The lyrics are indifferently crafted, and while their one-dimensionality is winningly perverse at a time when his old fans will take any ambiguity they can get, it does serve to flaunt their theological wrongheadedness and occasional jingoism. Nevertheless, this is his best album since Blood on the Tracks. The singing is passionate and detailed, and the pros behind him--especially Mark Knopfler, who has a studio career in store--play so sharply that his anger gathers general relevance at its most vindictive.

The absurd contention that by utilizing electronic horns and soul girls and big bam boom he's finally mastered pop fashion and state-of-the-craft production--I've actually heard this referred to as ""Disco Dylan""--proves only that his diehard fans are even more alienated from current music than he is. At best he's achieved the professionalism he's always claimed as his goal. No longer ""relevant"" enough to make ""statements"" that mean shit to any discernible audience--vide Infidels or, on this record, ""Trust Yourself"" (only if you say so, Bob)--he's certainly talented enough to come up with a good bunch of songs. Hence, his best album since Blood on the Tracks. I wish that was a bigger compliment, but debunking comparisons to Street-Legal are also way off--the arrangements and especially the singing are, yes, tasteful enough to support material that puts Elton John to shame. I mean how did he get that ominous calm, that soupcon of prophecy? And how did he come up with the toughest Vietnam-vet song yet?

Dylan's last cover album confused his followers mightily, not least because he called it Self-Portrait. And maybe he tossed this one off as per contract too--his boyish tenor and nimble acoustic guitar don't rescue ""Frankie and Albert"" or ""Sittin' on Top of the World"" from the taxidermist, and though ""Tomorrow Night"" could be a mean parody of Lonnie Johnson's sour-voiced original, it probably just sucks. But most of these old tunes he gooses or caresses to some kind of arousal--he clearly knows the sensitive spots of Stephen Foster's ""Hard Times"" and the antiredcoat jig ""Arthur McBride."" Not that he thinks such intimacy yields a self-portrait. Older than that now, he merely explores a world of song whose commonness and strangeness he knows he'll never comprehend.

But shaggy dog story or no shaggy dog story, ""Tangled Up in Blue"" doesn't belong, and neither does that supernal piece of crap ""Forever Young,"" because both are classic tracks from albums that precede Rolling Thunder and Desire, events that marked his epochal commitment to hackdom even if no one dreamed it at the time. On 14 cuts employing 57 session musicians, four of whom appear twice and none thrice, this collection celebrates that commitment. Its sonic trademark is the soulettes who back ""Changing of the Guards"" (Street Legal, 1978), ""The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar"" (Shot of Love, 1981), ""Silvio"" (Down in the Groove, 1988), and the magnificent 11-minute Sam Shepard collaboration ""Brownsville Girl"" (Knocked Out Loaded, 1986)--all obscure, all compelling, all cockeyed flights of prophecy or mythic narrative, and all featuring the backup pipes of Carol (sometimes Carolyn) Dennis, who I bet has been feeding him lines for two lost decades.

What no one ever mentions about this legendary Manchester concert is that the folk set stinks. It's arty, mannered, nervous, as if Dylan is sick of these songs, although three of the seven haven't even been released yet. And when they are, on Blonde on Blonde, they'll be band- if not Band-backed like all the others except ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" and as such relaxed, confident, committed, meaningful. Appallingly ideological though it is that anyone could have preferred this static display to what followed, the rock set is warmly received. This is not to say, however, that it lives up to its myth. You'll hear some of the most freewheeling, locked-in live music of the '60s--far more detailed and responsive than comparable Stones and Who, with Robbie Robertson so cockeyed funky he almost careens off the stage. You'll also hear some folkie fool shouting ""Judas"" and Dylan calling him a liar and, if you strain, somebody muttering ""play fucking loud."" But you will not hear the times a-changin' or Robert Zimmerman jousting with destiny. That stuff's for historians. And if we owe the historians for the terrific electric disc, they owe us for the awful acoustic one.

Although his voice is crumbling audibly and his band is too often static, Dylan remains one of our more thoughtful wordslingers in the ever-changing trad mode he's made his own. Still, the meme that this album is a major statement where Together Through Life was a holding action bespeaks the unseen hand of the autohype machine and the superstitious fears that attend 70th birthdays. Although the four trad relationship numbers that open build nicely on Together Through Life's strategy and groove, the closers aim higher with dubious-to-disgraceful results. For all its well-borrowed tune and well-digested details, nobody's putting the 14-minute Titanic ballad on repeat, and the seven-minute John Lennon dirge says nothing at half speed just like the naysayers neigh. That leaves four tracks, and how much you admire this record will depend on how redolent you find two of them: the quiet jeremiad ""Scarlet Town"" and the quieter love-triangle cut-'em-up ""Tin Angel."" I say they'd be better faster, possibly. As for ""Early Roman Kings,"" a black-comedy dis of the rich and richer, and ""Pay in Blood,"" folk-music death metal via sanguinary imagery and microphone placement, you gotta love 'em.

FALSE,B+,Hella Personal Film Festival,Open Mike Eagle + Paul White,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16777,"
Alt-rapper Eagle dominates this meeting of the oddballs, as vocalist-lyricists will. But it's the rockish samples of outlying London beatmaker White that define it, because their blatant indifference to hip-hop or EDM align Eagle with talky singer-songwriters like Jeffrey Lewis and Charlie King as much as with Kool A.D. or Serengeti. ""All my heroes is singers that can't sing,"" he ventures amid thoughts on cellphone dependence, barstool codependency, Obama flying by in a drone, and the skin he's in. So figure he already knows that the most powerful sonic here is a snatch of Lenny Bruce. That man had a sound.

FALSE,B+,On the Border,The Eagles,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3588,"
The critic in me has no doubt that this is their best album, although he notes that the male-bonding songs (which articulate an affirmative ethos) have more to say than the female-separation songs (which rationalize hostility into pity/contempt). And when the critic plays the record, the listener enjoys the Gram Parsons tribute ""My Man,"" the MOR-oriented ""Best of My Love,"" the vaguely anti-authoritarian ""On the Border,"" the permanently star-struck ""James Dean,"" and several others. But the listener is too turned off by what the band represents ever to put the thing on voluntarily.
"
FALSE,B+,That's the Way of the World,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1112,"
Trailing Parliament-Funkadelic in my personal post-Sly sweepstakes, but ahead of War (bombastic), Kool &amp; the Gang (culturally deprived), and hosts of others, this unit can do so many things it qualifies as the one-man band of black music even though it has nine members. Here ethnomusicology and colloquial homiletics are tacked onto the funk and soul and doowop and jazz, which makes for an instructive contrast--the taped-in-Africa Matepe Ensemble, whose spontaneous laughter closes out the coda, versus Maurice White, whose humorless platitutdes prove there's more to roots than turning a mbira into an ersatz vibraphone.
"
FALSE,B+,All 'n All,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1113,"
Focusing soulful horns, high-tension harmonies, and rhythms and textures from many lands onto a first side that cooks throughout. Only one element is lacking. Still, unsympathetic as I am to lyrics about conquering the universe on wings of thought, they make me shake my fundament anyway.
"
FALSE,B+,Raise!,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4714,"
As long as they hew to a few simple rules--up on the tempos, down on the bullshit, etc.--there's no reason why these fellows can't turn their sparkling harmonies and powerful groove into a pure, contentless celebration of virtuosity. I mean once a year--at least in theory. But this is the first time the possibility's ever even occurred to me, which must mean they felt a show of strength was due.
"
FALSE,B+,Touch the World,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1116,"
Though supposedly they've reconstituted as a lean quintet, the credits credit Maurice White and hired guns, notably Philip Bailey who sings lead on two cuts, shares lead on three, and backs up wherever. White gets only two compositions, which may explain why such a fabrication seems more in touch with the world than his solo album, where he made the mistake of expressing himself. Canceling out El Lay buy-a-song like ""Every Now and Then"" are the side-openers, the strongest protests this seminal pop transcendentalist has ever gotten down. Both focus on money, something he obviously has a feel for.
"
FALSE,B+,Stop That Train,Clint Eastwood & General Saint,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4717,"
If this album's enjoyably joky yarns and stoned satire seem to come from backstage while the debut's came from outer space, it's not just because the surprise factor is gone. It's also the settings, devised by Kingston's most dubwise studio astronauts on the first album but assigned here to rude Inity Rockers with ska accents and music hall tempos.
"
FALSE,B+,Echo and the Bunnymen,Echo and the Bunnymen,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4721,"
In a desperate attempt to market Ian McCulloch's crumpled shirts and skin problems (two of the most likable things about him, I'd say), Warners pulls two top cuts off Porcupine, counted by some a step in the right direction. Revealingly, they're the two worst things here, though where ""The Cutter"" is a pretentious dog (quills sticking out all over the little bugger), ""Back of Love"" is merely more histrionic than the competition. Suggested motto: ""Do It Clean,"" which here builds to a casual vocal rave-up in a seven-minute concert version that could almost make you believe these spaced-out student existentialists were rock-and-rollers.
"
FALSE,B+,Rockpile,Dave Edmunds,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=936,"
A glance at the titles suggests yet another ho-hum revival--Berry 'n' blues to go with a novelty-hit remake of Smiley Lewis's (not Pat Boone's, right?) ""I Hear You Knocking."" But a glance at the credits establishes that Edmunds played just about everything but bass himself, even on ""The Promised Land,"" apparently recorded in 1966. And a perusal of the titles adds Dylan twelve-bar, ""It Ain't Easy,"" and--what's this?--Neil Young's ""Dance Dance Dance"" to The Tradition. Sounds pretty weird, too.
"
FALSE,B+,Get It,Dave Edmunds,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=938,"
In which Edmunds convenes the Monmouth Rockabilly Seminar, featuring source material both standard (Hank Williams, Otis Blackwell, Arthur Crudup) and arcane (Rodgers &amp; Hart), recent research by Bob Seger and Graham Parker, and new monographs from Nicholas Lowe and Edmunds himself. Great stuff, although studious detachment don't necessarily do it proud.
"
FALSE,B+,D.E. 7th,Dave Edmunds,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=943,"
It's a measure of my respect for Edmunds that at this point his meticulous collections of oldies and newies impress me much the way good new Chicago blues albums do, and I vouch for number seven, especially the newies on side one. When was the last time you were more than mildly excited by a good new Chicago blues album?
"
FALSE,B+,Glad to Be Here,Bernard Edwards,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=269,"
Edwards's career training as a bass player doesn't suit him for lead roles, which means that what is basically a rather subtle Chic album may never sneak up on you the way it did on this fan. For what it's worth, the two Chic-est grooves on the album features Nard as vocalist but not bassist, leaving that role to synth whiz Ray Chew. Could this be magic?
"
FALSE,B+,Blackbird,Stoney Edwards,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6777,"
In which well-meaning producer Chip Taylor provides Edwards with a wonderful title tune about ""a couple of country niggers/Stealin' the rodeo"" while nudging him in a rockish, folkish direction, probably in the belief that he has a better shot at an audience over there. The results are hardly disgraceful, though Joe Cocker didn't get away with six minutes worth of ""Bird on a Wire"" either. But the straight country album Edwards did last year was a lot tougher. When people in Nashville get serious, they have a tendency to fall for pretentious schmaltz--that's the story of Mickey Newbury's life. A lot of this, straight country and folkish-rockish both, is too damn close to the edge.

FALSE,B+,Assassinator,Eek-A-Mouse,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1131,"
What kind of artist interprets the legend of Tarzan to the tune of ""Wimoweh"" immediately after outlining his ""Triple Love"" life just so he can revel in ""en"" rhymes(""ten,"" ""den,"", ""lend,"" ""bend,"" ""them,"" ""Ardenne,"" ""Hughenden,"" ""Gwen,"" ""Jen,"" ""Karen,"" ""they even make love with my best friend Ken,"" and of course the literal nonsense ""lah-den"")? A major eccentric who makes most of those who cultivate that image look like self-serving twits, that's who. Also an eccentric whose first three songs here start with death by gunfire.

FALSE,B+,Mouseketeer,Eek-A-Mouse,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4726,"
Prolific and then some, he's a little less consistent on this album than on its immediate competitor, and since there are no printed lyrics I'll probably never know what the anorexic was doing at Reggae Sunsplash. But the hot pressing and dubbed-up Henry Junjo Lawes production do compensate for his tendency to set all his songpoems to the same melody, leading off with his account of Queen Elizabeth's unscheduled audience and climaxing with an explanation (?) of how he got his name betting the horses.
"
FALSE,B+,Live,8 Eyed Spy,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4727,"
I've always had my doubts about Lydia Lunch, but this Chris Stamey-recorded tape establishes her beyond doubt as the most promising female novelty artist in the American underground. Unlike Debora Iyall, she makes no apparent distinction between sex and eros, which is why she's a novelty artist, but Iyall should follow her lead in the giving-it-what-you-got department. Pat Irwin's dissenting sax and George Scott's pushy bass are what they got, and where they got it was James Chance.

FALSE,B+,A New World Record,Electric Light Orchestra,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6780,"
Eat your diploma, Eric Carmen--after years of floundering, they've gone all the way and made a Moody Blues album with brains, hooks, and laffs galore. My fave is ""Rockaria!,"" about a lass who ""loves the way Puccini lays down a tune."" Granted, I initially thought it was strictly for those who got off on music appreciation in high school, like the lass. But now I think it's also for those who hated it, like me.

A New World Record aside, this is a singles band, which makes their compilation the European Tradition's answer to Bubble Gum Music Is the Naked Truth. I love that ""Mr. Blue Sky,"" almost my favorite is ""Turn to Stone,"" and how 'bout ""Telephone Line""?
"
FALSE,B+,Down on the Drag,Joe Ely,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6785,"
Ely's songwriting pal Butch Hancock, who's beginning to sound like a great one, contributes four more; if ""Fools Fall in Love"" sounds like a lame title, how do you like ""Wise men hit the bottom, Lord/A fool falls right on through""? But Ely himself seems to have run short of tunes, and except for ""Crazy Lemon"" (which gets across on the crazy force of its lyric and vocal, not on its melody), none of his songs call you back.
"
FALSE,B+,Live Shots,Joe Ely,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1725,"
Like a thousand blues and jazz guys before him, Ely is an American whose live album should have seen America first--not a year, a charting studio record, and a major endorsement after touring the U.K. The claim that this injustice was a corporate blunder is boogie bullshit: even prime material acutely performed sounds a little redundant in an artist whose fundamental is songs. Still, this is prime and acute. Let's hope he rides the Clash's tailwind right into downtown Lubbock.
"
FALSE,B+,Musta Notta Gotta Lotta,Joe Ely,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4731,"
Hanging out with the Clash hasn't been so great for Ely's music--he's rocking harder than ever, but with a forced urgency that detracts from the songs. Only ""I Keep Getting Paid the Same"" is heightened by his breakneck boogie, and both Roy Brown's ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" and Shorty Long's ""Rock Me My Baby"" would come across better if they rolled a little. Best in show: Butch Hancock's Spanish-tinged ""Wishin' for You.""
"
FALSE,B+,Lord of the Highway,Joe Ely,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1726,"
A decade of being told what a hot shit he is has Ely oversinging to signify his intensity, which is too bad: he might have snuck in ""Silver City"" if he'd talked the song instead of howling it. But when he keeps it light--pissed off at Billy the Kid or his girlfriend's karate lessons or that s.o.b. Lucky, who gets the lowdown on the honey he left behind--Ely rebounds like he's made of silicone. He's an honest man--when Steve Earle and Dwight Yoakam meet women who take self-defense courses, they're too fucking pure to admit it.
"
FALSE,B+,Love and Danger,Joe Ely,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1728,"
As these things are now measured, he's finally a country artist--a good one. You can tell by the way Tony Brown stops him from oversinging. By the way he lays into the similes on ""Sleepless in Love"" and the rhymes on ""She Collected."" By the way he writes nothing but love songs, including two stinkers. By the way Robert Earl Keen furnishes mythos and memories without filling Butch Hancock's shoes.
"
FALSE,B+,Past Life Martyred Saints,EMA,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15586,"
Erika Anderson claims ""Zen nihilism"" is what you get growing up on South Dakota's bleak prairie under South Dakota's endless sky, which sounds reasonable until you start counting how many South Dakotans feel this way: approximately one. So insofar as she pretends her willful pose is the holy truth, she's annoying. What saves that pose is the willful power of a presentation less Courtney Love or Chan Marshall than PJ Harvey--""nothin and nothin and nothin and nothin"" as an emotional reality that's her truth whether she's maxing out on free love or playing Russian roulette with a butterfly knife.
"
FALSE,B+,Death Travels West,The Embarrassment,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3592,"
Eight droning, astringent, strangely catchy songs about everything from the Lewis and Clark Expedition to ""There's no doubt about it my old friend's a monster."" The horror--the horror.
"
FALSE,B+,Kamikaze,Eminem,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17378,"
Strangely, the album he devotes to demolishing the Metacritic drones and social media ignorami who slimed Revival is more substantial than that clumsy labor of pride itself. That's because it's about hip-hop, his truest passion and sole area of undeniable expertise, rather than the larger emotional and political themes of what he conceived as a groundbreaking statement of principle. I mean, I like Migos, ""Hanna Montana"" as much as ""Bad and Boujee."" But anyone who got through the ambient overkill of Culture II without falling asleep should kick meth, and the parodies of the trio here are overdue--""Brain dead, eyedrops/Pain meds, Cyclops/Daybed, iPod/May-back, Maybach"" or ""Lug nut coaster [actual online-available consumer durable]/Lung jug roaster [set-up]/Young Thug poster [wham]/Unplugged toaster [cool]"" even more than the thematic ""Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of songs about nothin' and mumble 'em."" Similarly, the relationship songs are Kim songs that don't mention her name--metaphors for the emotional dysfunctionality of a narrator whose only show of relatable feeling here comes with his highly belated farewell to his D-12 crew. As for calling Tyler the Creator the F-word, can I mention that rebel without a clue Tyler has misused that odious term far more freely than Eminem ever did--and that the pro forma p.c.-ness of Mathers's apology (""hurting a lot of other people,"" attaboy) comes as a relief from someone we can hope comes to terms with conventional morality e'en now.

FALSE,B+,The Orlando Sentinel,Emperor X,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17084,"
In 2014, a testicular cancer survivor constructs weedy-to-wispy electronic/guitar-strum/handclap songs about getting your parents Medicaid and cell plans, President Sarkozy's bake sale, AI swim laws (??), Kafka shopping at Primark, dying young with resources and integrity intact, and just generally proving the Politburo right because we've got all this capital and what good does it do anyone? I wouldn't say he sounds happy about this, or much amused. But he is philosophical, because after all: ""One good effect of the crash / Now every altered state gets classified as work--at least enough to prevent an epidemic of a baseless adolescent philosophy."" Which scans, in its way.
"
FALSE,B+,"Greetings From Cairo, Illinois",Stace England,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13053,"
Roots-rock program music about the southernmost city in Illinois. He doesn't detail much vice, which was once the town's bread and butter, but there's lots of race--1909 lynch mob, segregated bus crosses big river, 1967 vigilantes, young Jesse Jackson stops by. Better researched than Sufjan, but not as evocative, nor any longer on answers.
"
FALSE,B+,What Is Beat?,The English Beat,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3597,"
With its remixes, live versions, and non-LP U.K. singles, this Jamaican farewell portends the consumer confusion of compilations to come. Strictly speaking, eight of its thirteen offerings are new to LP, but in general I prefer the original cuts (and sequencing), and I can't understand why the hot disco remix of ""Twist and Crawl"" was left out of the grab bag. Collectors might as well go for the cassette, which though it's slightly inferior audiowise does exploit the biz's sanest tactic to the noble campaign to scourge home taping by adding four tracks, two live and two U.K.-only, including the secret classic ""Wrong Side of the Bed.""
"
FALSE,B+,Music for Films,Brian Eno,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=446,"
Many of these eighteen cuts seem more like fragments than pieces, and although most of them provide subtle melodic or (especially) textural dynamics, the overall effect is a touch too willful in its impressionism for my tastes. Another Green World decelerating, which is a funny thing for movie music to do. Or maybe ECM with hindsight, a/k/a a tape splicer.
"
FALSE,B+,On Land,Brian Eno,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=449,"
In pulse, movement, and textural detail, this falls somewhere between the static Music for Airports (a bore) and the exotic Jon Hassell collaboration (a trip). Whenever I play it (usually late at night) I experience an undeniable pleasure so mild I'm not sure anyone would want to pay for it. Caveat emptor.

By way of the crass product advisory they deserve, let it be recorded that 1992's Funky Divas captures their cultural moment and this one beats it song for song, including mild pleasantries from their undistinguished debut and adieu. Say ciao to the queens of air-kiss soul.
"
FALSE,B+,Unfinished Business,EPMD,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1183,"
The full-sized hooks and understated groove still mesh, but fame has rendered this self-made duo less brazen and more arrogant simultaneously. The real money (and pussy) they now boast doesn't suit them any better than the increasing subtlety of their steals--they need tunes, not just beats. But beyond the humble origins described in ""Please Listen to My Demo"" and the dramatized public service announcement ""You Had Too Much To Drink,"" the overriding idea seems to be that stars can do it themselves. Which is the usual half-truth.
"
FALSE,B+,Gohead,Erasmus Hall,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4738,"
The best Clinton spinoff since the Brides (not including Bootsy, who's on board as well) makes the funk album of the year (not including rap, which I guess is where funk went). Of course, to hear Capitol tell it, George discovered these Detroit pros long after they had their own thing. In the nick of time, I'd say.
"
FALSE,B+,Don't Slander Me,Roky Erickson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4740,"
A garage rant about blues theology that built from blues readymades and accelerated on the kind of mad thrust you don't hear much from revivalists or anybody else, the now rerecorded title single was all natural timing and spirit possession, a paradise regained of rock and roll clich������������������. The album exploits this miracle--sounds like a bunch of would-be old farts (with genuine article Jack Casady lending a touch of authenticity) latching onto the old wildman for the kind of magic carpet ride other music lovers only collect. It's too precise, too forceful, too showy. And if you can bear the protracted tributes to Eric""You Drive Me Crazy."" Or ""Crazy Crazy Mama."" Or ""Bermuda,"" about the triangle.
"
FALSE,B+,The Evil One,Roky Erickson and the Aliens,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4739,"
Never a big Satanism fan, I've resisted this crazed and-you-thought-acid-was-bad testament from the long-wasted leader of the long-departed 13th Floor Elevators. But not one of the West Coast's new psychedelic rockboys has come up with half this many dirty guitar riffs, or anything that holds a candle to ""Don't Shake Me Lucifer."" And unlike the Flesh Eaters' Chris D., for instance, he seems to mean it, whatever exactly ""it"" might be.

She's compelling when the rhythm gets her, annoying when she pledges slow-motion devotion, just like uncounted party girls before her--and also like uncounted rock pros before her, which is more the point. Don't deny her her gimmick--received or stolen though this suburban salsa may be, it can getcha.
"
FALSE,B+,Be Yourself Tonight,Eurythmics,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4746,"
New wave's answer to Shirley Bassey is finally connecting with those of us who won't settle for voice-plus-hooks not because she shows signs of having a soul, but because she shows signs of having a brain. Of course, the two go together--her lush, brassy emotionalism is more coherent partly because it's grounded, less taken with alienation as a way of life. Dave Stewart's guitar doesn't hurt either. And neither do Aretha, Stevie, or Elvis.
"
FALSE,B+,Revenge,Eurythmics,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4747,"
Annie Lennox's rich, lustrous range and diction threaten to overwhelm these stripped-down arrangements, bringing such odious Annies as Haslam and Wilson to mind. But while you'd never call her enthusiasm natural, it's not forced or foolish either--this is rock and roll as sheer performance, its basics paraded with pride and a glint of humor. If only it was all side-openers like ""Missionary Man,"" recommended to Pat Robertson, and the V-8 airmobile ""Let's Go.""
"
FALSE,B+,Savage,Eurythmics,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4748,"
Beethoven-lover as Neiman-Marcus girl, trans-Asiatic jilt, real live pseudoferal yowl announcing the cock-crazy ""I Need a Man,"" synthesized pseudorathskeller clink-and-chatter punctuating the sarcasm-crazy ""I Need You""--this record peaks so high that I tried to ignore all the in-between. It's there, though--medium tempo romantic-as-in-movement pseudoschlock, edgier than their worst but not so's it cuts much ice.

In which a Norwegian sexpot or credible simulation of same devises ditties along the lines of ""I've got a credit card/Big as a whale/I want to buy your love/Is it for sale?"" By the stringent standards of the Black Eyed Peas, not deep, although ""Life Still Goes On"" tries. Not beatwise, either. But less well-fixed than she pretends, I bet. And seductively catchy, in which sexy helps.

FALSE,B+,So Much for the Afterglow,Everclear,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1216,"
Art Alexakis knows he got lucky and figures the surest way to maximize his success is to maximize his music, showing the strengths and weaknesses of someone you sincerely hope has found the investment counselor of his dreams. With his big riffs and self-aggrandizing evocations of a credible life, he's at his best working the timeworn audience-as-beloved trope. The title tune says everything he needs to say about follow-ups in the age of the one-shot.
"
FALSE,B+,T-Bird Rhythm,The Fabulous Thunderbirds,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4756,"
In theory I always appreciated this Texas party band's penchant for understatement--most white bluesboys demean themselves and the music they love by playing it strictly for raunch. But in practice their albums were, if you'll pardon my jargon, boring. So new producer Nick Lowe, who could find a pop hook in a field holler, makes a difference. Both sides open with fetchingly offhand ravers, Kim Wilson works his shoo-fly drawl for gumbo lilt, and the mysterious J. Miller contributes the irresistible ""You're Humbuggin' Me,"" which had me tearing through my Jimmy Reed records in a fruitless search for the original.
"
FALSE,B+,Snakes and Ladders/The Best of Faces,Faces,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6798,"
Not counting ""Pineapple and the Monkey,"" a special for all those who believe their quintessence was sloppy instrumentals, this showcases the good stuff from Long Player and Ooh La La. Lots of fun, a solid testament to a band that was never very much into solidity--and a little more of a Rod Stewart album than is desirable for peak flavor.
"
FALSE,B+,We Are the Rage,Jad Fair and the Shapir O'Rama,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1624,"
Although these 23 soliloquies in 46 minutes are a little long on noize-will-be-noize guitar, umpteenth collaborator Kim Rancourt (of When People Were Shorter and Lived in the Water, since you asked) does the 42-year-old boy wonder a favor by sticking up for himself. In fact, while nothing tops the climactic love poem only Jad could have written (""Her eyes are the color of a Slurpee""? ""She smells as good as pizza""?), it was Rancourt who gave him the definitive ""I Comb My Hair With My Hand."" And who sings several of the best soliloquies here all by himself.
"
FALSE,B+,Dangerous Acquaintances,Marianne Faithfull,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2249,"
More conventional than Broken English, which isn't to say it's less feminist. On the contrary, Faithfull is even writing her own lyrics instead of letting some man do it, and coming up with universal truths like ""where did it go to my youth"" and ""looking to find my identity"" in the process. And singing in such palpably broken English that she almost gets away with it. This time.
"
FALSE,B+,A Child's Adventure,Marianne Faithfull,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2250,"
Skilled work, hookful and lithely arranged and sung with a racked grace far more accomplished than the harrowing croaks of Broken English. If I were a woman in search of rock and roll models, I might well dote on it. But model rock and roll it's not--Broken English still got the power.
"
FALSE,B+,Kissin Time,Marianne Faithfull,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11546,"
She's a professional sufferer, to be taken seriously as who she is rather than what she symbolizes. That said, and despite two dull Billy Corgan copyrights, these collaborations with the likes of Blur and Beck are her best bunch of songs since--not Broken English, that's ridiculous, but Strange Weather or A Child's Adventure. And that said, its peak is a ghost closer from the '60s, Goffin-King's supremely untortured ""I'm Into Something Good""--inspired by Earl Jean's version, not Herman's Hermits', all feminists devoutly hope.

FALSE,B+,You're So Fine,The Falcons,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11455,"
I avoid Collectorland, a murky place where one-hit geniuses stab around in the dark and unidentified middlemen muffle the music. But raves on this group, which over the first nine years included Wilson Pickett, Eddie Floyd, Mack Rice, and Levi Stubbs's little brother Joe, overwhelmed my prejudices, and my eight months of listening were almost worth the trouble. These 16 cuts are pre-Pickett, and chief lead Stubbs is what you'd expect--like Pickett and Levi only less so. Wild and gritty in the smoothie era, the '50s Falcons made more of shouting uptempo harmony (and polyphony) than anybody but their producer noticed at the time, and revivalists should check out side one for covers. Side two starts getting generic even if the genre is their own.
"
FALSE,B+,I Found a Love,The Falcons,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11456,"
With Pickett replacing Stubbs and soul moving on up, songwriting gives way to performance, and when Stubbs rejoins the group the fireworks can get pretty amazing, especially with Don West's horn arrangement and Lance Finnie's guitar thrown in. But stylistically a lot of this is transitional, which means that often the fireworks consist of lead voices blending in like would-be smoothies. This is fine only as far as it goes.

After dismissing this as just too tuneless and crude--wasn't even fast--I played it in tandem with Public Image Ltd. one night and for a few bars could hardly tell the difference. Of course, in this case the heavy bass and distant guitars could simply mean a bad mix, but what the hell--when they praise spastics and ""the r&amp;r dream"" they're not being sarcastic (I don't think), and in this icky pop moment we could use some ugly rebellion. How about calling it punk?

FALSE,B+,This Nation's Saving Grace,The Fall,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4763,"
If the sentimental fallacy of good American rock and roll is roots, the sentimental fallacy of good British rock and roll is amateurism. Not that these veterans distinguished themselves from themselves before Yank guitarist Brix E. Smith righted husband Mark E.'s feckless avant-gardishness. Still, what they've arrived at now is cunningly sloppy, minimally catchy Hawkwind/Stooges with each three-chord drone long enough to make an avant-gardish statement but stopping short of actual boredom. And yeah, it beats roots by me.
"
FALSE,B+,The Frenz Experiment,The Fall,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4764,"
If Brix is so busy leading Mark into the valley of the shadow of sellout, how'd she let him get away with an album of vamps with recitation? Lyrics center around a title catchphrase--""Get a Hotel,"" ""The Steak Place,"" and ""Oswald Defence Lawyer"" are the cutest--and allude to crime. Vamps are mostly--shame on you, Brix--catchy.
"
FALSE,B+,Bandstand,The Family,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6803,"
When they kick ass on ""Burlesque"" or ""Glove"" or ""Broken Nose"" they sound raw and abrasive in the great English hard rock tradition, but the discords are altogether more cunning, and on this album their stubborn lyricism finally finds suitable melodies on ""Coronation"" and ""My Friend the Sun"" and the bittersweet ""Dark Eyes."" Their sexual anger is class-conscious, always a plus, and their sadness usually a matter of time, which they get away with when the melody is very suitable. And just as they begin to get it together they break up.
"
FALSE,B+,It's Only a Movie,The Family,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6804,"
So they didn't break up after all, but the close call seems to have mellowed them--this is their funniest, funkiest, most relaxed album. I know an autumnal Roger Chapman is a little hard to imagine, but this is a man of many guises--back in the beginning he sometimes came on like an opera singer. Pick: ""Leroy,"" inspired by ""No Money Down.""
"
FALSE,B+,Charity Ball,Fanny,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6807,"
Seeing this band live was a revelation--for women, playing old-fashioned tight commercial rock and roll was a challenge rather than a self-conscious historical exercise. But that's not why there's been such improvement in the studio, although the live show held a clue--drummer Alice de Buhr was the most exciting musician on stage. This record exploits her chops and presence, sinking the pop harmonies in a harder, funkier frame. The title tune is a pure raver that oughtabeahit, but almost every song has something--or several somethings--to recommend it. Which is a lot more than I'd say of the Hollies' latest.

If everything here had the propulsion of ""Like a G6,"" this would be 2010's answer to The E.N.D., forget the more likely-seeming candidate. Instead, a one-hit wonder their tribute to the Gulfstream 65 jet will remain. The other nine three-minute songs are more like little Fokkers--party-ready, Auto-Tuned electrohop whose disposable superficiality is an aesthetic principle and whose guest list is a reality show waiting to happen. R. Tedder of One Republic and S. Dogg of Faux Murder LLC? In this context, they could be the same dude. Not so Keri Hilson or Kate Pierson, however. In the morning, they remain hard-working Asian-American lads who respect their mothers.

FALSE,B+,. . . And His Orchestra,The Fastbacks,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4767,"
Ace junk guitarist Kurt Bloch is the orchestra leader, off-key heroine Lulu Garguilo his girl singer, and they care so much that if the mixes were cleaner they'd strike fear in the heart of the sainted Joan Jett. As it is, even the lyrics are pretty garage. Maybe next time they'll abandon their principles a little.
"
FALSE,B+,Big and Beautiful,Fat Boys,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4770,"
Just by announcing a ""stupid def side,"" they reaffirm their timeless message: stupid is def, def is stupid, all is one. Former sideman Dave Ogrin updates their beats without trying to tackle Rick Rubin head on. Their run-in with the Russkies is as meaningful a cultural exchange as ""Rapp Symphony (In C-Minor)."" And even more than their moving rendition of ""Sex Machine,"" the title track sits all over rap's serious macho heavies. It may even get these jumbo gigolos something good to eat.
"
FALSE,B+,Only Life,The Feelies,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3608,"
With rock and roll--music--as mystico-cerebral as the Feelies', analysis takes you only so far. In the end, you get it or you don't. Me, I find album three their most accomplished and least effective, and suspect that both its accomplishment and its (relative) ineffectiveness reflect the same crisis of growth. After all, this is rock and roll, not music; rock and roll has always had trouble with the mature perspective signalled by a couplet like ""Got a ways to go/So much to know."" Just because the perpetual nervousness of Crazy Rhythms and the pastoral lyricism of The Good Earth are callower, they fit the musical concept better. Either that or the concept is fading for me. Or for them.

FALSE,B+,Black President,Fela,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4776,"
Building steadily off unpolyrhythmic traps, underpinning/undermining the beat with multiple drums, stating and embellishing horn phrases and then stating and embellishing them again, repeating verbal taglines countless times again or varying them by a few words to strengthen his points, Fela has constructed Afrobeat, which to my ear is as like and unlike any competing African pop style as it is like and unlike any American pop style. It's just Fela, instantly recognizable, although not always instantly distinguished from other Fela. Distinguishing themselves here are ""I.T.T."" (""international thief thief"") and ""Sorrow Tears and Blood"" (""dem regular trademark""). That's three-quarters of the record.

FALSE,B+,Narvel Felts,Narvel Felts,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6813,"
An r&amp;b singer on the country side of the fence, Narvel recalls Roy Orbison (they both worked for Sun) or Ferlin Husky at the fountain of youth. Wotta voice--he even does ""Gone."" It should go without saying that I love sexy r&amp;b covers like ""Slip Away"" and ""Honey Love"" and filthy-minded country originals like ""Let My Fingers Do the Walking."" But even when he's maudlin and self-involved I get off some on his naked, nasal emotion. Sometimes I like the country side of the fence myself.

FALSE,B+,Fuera de Alcance/Out of Reach,Freddy Fender,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6815,"
N������������������ Baldemar Huerta, this South Texas legend is a real traditionalist, as he illustrates on the title number, a country song warbled in Spanish over a reggae backing track. Cutting ""Jamaica Farewell"" twenty years after Harry Belafonte went pop with it. Time travel is nothing to a man who's done three years for weed, a drug commemorated--along with wine, cocaine, and morphine--on a version of ""Junko Partner"" that made Dr. John blush as he tickled the ivories in fond support. And ""holding his hand and showing him the way is, no other than the great, incredible TV personality, Mr. Domingo Pe����������""
"
FALSE,B+,Rock 'n' Country,Freddy Fender,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1291,"
Fender is a wonder of nature--I just wish one of his albums was a wonder of human devising. This is his third LP for ABC in ten months, and like the others it doesn't get the essence of a man who can follow an incandescent country version of ""What'd I Say"" with an incandescent country version of ""How Much Is That Doggie in the Window."" That's the parlay that opens side two of Are You Ready for Freddy, his most satisfying side for ABC to date; this is his most satisfying whole LP. His tenor is so penetrating, his Spanish lisp so guileless, that it's a pleasure to hear him sing almost anything, but he doesn't transcend himself as often as seems possible; why, for instance, should ""Big Boss Man"" work so much better than ""Since I Met You Baby""? If only there were someone who knew.

FALSE,B+,"Another Time, Another Place",Bryan Ferry,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=453,"
Comedy routines are rarely as funny the second time around, especially when you've used up your best lines--""The `In' Crowd"" is the only zinger Ferry comes up with here. Elsewhere he who plays at corruption is afflicted with disease--lead poisoning, it sounds like, affecting not only his brain but also his lungs and his pants. ""You Are My Sunshine"" makes ""sense"" slow, but too often Ferry simply indulges his taste for the lachrymose on songs that deserve better.
"
FALSE,B+,In Your Mind,Bryan Ferry,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=455,"
Ferry has custom-designed a new line of songs for his solo concept, rather than borrowing from early Roxy or his humble forebears, and especially on side one the stuff is appealingly down-to-earth. But it doesn't go far enough. I used to think Ferry's big problem was the fruity baritone that epitomized his deliberate unnaturalness, but now I think it's the hopeless romanticism of his half-realized dreams. If he ever did convince large numbers of people to care about his obsessions, the result would be nothing more than a rather scary collective escapism.
"
FALSE,B+,The Bride Stripped Bare,Bryan Ferry,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=456,"
Maybe the smoke in Bryan's eyes has finally reached his heart; the apparent sincerity of some of the singing here makes those five-minute moments when he lingers ponderously over a key lyric easier to take. The Los Angeles musicians don't hurt either--the conjunction of his style of stylization (feigned detachment) makes for interesting expressive tension. And Waddy Wachtel is as apt a sound-effects man as Phil Manzanera ever was.
"
FALSE,B+,Street Life: 20 Greatest Hits,Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=459,"
Their third compilation in twelve years is the third to include ""Love Is the Drug,"" but I won't quibble. ""These Foolish Things"" was always better as a title than as rendition, but I won't quibble. The number in the subtitle follows the formula twenty = CD, and I'm quibbling. A great gift idea--for yourself you can buy less or more.
"
FALSE,B+,Dimples,"Richard ""Dimples"" Fields",1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4782,"
Except for Betty Wright's backtalking one-upwomanship, the prime originals here--""I Like Your Lovin"" and ""She's Got Papers on Me""--are standard-issue love-man come-ons, but ""Dimples""'s appropriation of the two greatest doowop oldies is self-aggrandizing sentimentality at its most audacious. And ""I've Got to Learn to Say No!"" leaves no doubt as to just what he gets from his earth angel in the still of the night.
"
FALSE,B+,We've Come for Your Beer,Fiends,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4784,"
This hardcore comedy highlight includes tributes to the MC-5, the Brady Bunch, John Belushi, and Bob Hope (""Die Bob Die"") among its twelve tunes or tracks or whatever. Not counting the perfectly timed ""Ramblin' Rose,"" my favorite is ""No More Drugs,"" an idea that's always good for a cheap laugh. Just wish more of them had as much tune or whatever.

FALSE,B+,Ziphansi Izintsizwa,Fihlamahlazo Nabochwepheshe,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4785,"
On several of the mbaqanga albums now available from New Music Distribution Service, the shock of the simple is neutralized by the dull ache of the monotonous. Here the beats remain pretty basic, and damned if I can hear the rude-bowed fiddle depicted on the cover, but the bass is active, there's constant squeezebox byplay, and the leader never shuts up, following song with harangue on almost every cut. Wish I had some idea what he was talking about.

These Wodaabe and Tuareg obviously put aside their cultural differences, because seeing the world like those Tinariwen dudes beats breeding cattle or camels, as the case may be. But so what? Their Wodaabe polyphony is a difference worth selling the world. Sahara trance-rock, Niger stylee.
"
FALSE,B+,Fine Young Cannibals,Fine Young Cannibals,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1254,"
Andy Cox and David Steele aren't quite up to Beat-quality tunes or the post-Caribbean funk that might compensate, and some will find Roland Gift's Brit-soul strain affected. Me, I knew he was singing about something real long before I checked out the lyrics, which testify as does all too little black crossover these days to an ordinary life of hard choices--a lot harder than whether to believe that woman, which rest assured does enter into it.
"
FALSE,B+,Clear Heart Full Eyes,Craig Finn,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15590,"
On a wittingly laid-back solo debut where the declamatory Hold Steady frontman knows he can't bring off the country vocals his best songs deserve, he nails three flat-out anyway: ""Terrified Eyes"" (couple destroyed by their hospital bills), ""When No One's Watching"" (snazzy scuzzball seeks needy women), and ""Balcony"" (she does with her new man what she did with her old man back when he was new). The rest tend more, how to say it, evocative. But at least they evoke specifics--Middle American dramatis personae as marginal as Wussy's.
"
FALSE,B+,We All Want the Same Things,Craig Finn,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17017,"
Finn's Americans are beyond politics. Barflies and hopheads, petty criminals unlikely to kill or maim, working stiffs with a hustle on the side, fuckups milking disability checks and insurance settlements, the musical lifers who bleed into all these categories--none of them are kids anymore, and of course, neither is Finn. My personal interest in this demographic has never been all that personal and continues to wane--I wish a few of his antiheroes had kids. But he sure can sing a sad story if you call that singing. And there's no denying the wah-wah hook of the opener, the musicality of the spoken-word ""God in Chicago,"" the unrequited love at first sight of ""It Hits When It Hits,"" or the secret love of ""Rescue Blues.""
"
FALSE,B+,In the Heart of the Heart of the Country,Fire Town,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4789,"
No oblique harmonies or trick meters or underhanded lyrics to prove how arty they are, just a blunt collection of pop songs that hauls out the hooks and hits you over the head with them thump-thump-thump. Which could and does get annoying when you're not feeling complaisant, but for the most part has its unfashionable charm. If you think the Smithereens are something, I dare you to play ""Rain on You"" three times. And if you don't, I double-dare you.
"
FALSE,B+,Fishbone,Fishbone,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4790,"
Looking like postmodern vaudevillians who've just signed themselves in at the mental hospital, with sartorial details appropriated from the Specials, Dizzy Gillespie, Jimi Hendrix, Stepin Fetchit, and whoever, these six black L.A. teenagers show a flair for visual outrage worthy of George Clinton himself, though funk is far down on an equally eclectic list of musical influences that subsumes metal, new wave, and cool-jazz finger-pop into a ska Prince Buster never dreamed of. It's all too scattered, without much songwriting focus beyond the Devo-meets-Clinton ""? (Modern Industry),"" but in a world of of Prince clones and ugly presidents these guys are cause for hope.
"
FALSE,B+,It's a Wonderful Life (We Gonna Have a Good Time),Fishbone,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4792,"
Songwriting on this Xmas novelty was so noticeable I thought maybe they'd reconstructed some obscurity from the flick of the same name, but the pissed-off title track's an original, as are Saint Nick as debbil-cum-wino, Christ as comsymp, and Uncle Scrooge as Uncle Jam. All are well-served by the band's feckless eclecticism, too. Call it a gift from God and hope it presages a brighter future.

FALSE,B+,Supersnazz,Flamin Groovies,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10877,"
This is some kind of cross between good-bad rock and roll and ""The Sheik of Araby,"" with just the kind of tongue-in-cheek aesthetic distance for which I have an unnatural weakness. The first three cuts on the first side give a representative taste.
"
FALSE,B+,Flamingo,Flamin Groovies,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3612,"
The mix and the groove are fierce enough to accommodate ""Keep a Knockin',"" ""Comin After Me"" is worthy of Chuck Berry, and ""Second Cousin"" could have been written for Jerry Lee Lewis, which makes a trinity. I do miss the wacked-out head of such Supersnazz classics as ""Laurie Did It"" and ""The First One's Free,"" but the fifteen minutes expanded on the last three cuts are a bigger problem--even the fast one drags. Sophisticated r&amp;r primitivists are supposed to know about that stuff.

Decorative flourishes and all, Flanagan's cocktail piano is as intelligent as easy-listening music ever gets--bebop as a received style. I prefer this to the classic Flanagan trio record--Eclypso, on Inner City--because I prefer the tunes (especially Monk's ""Friday the 13th""). Also because the less auspicious rhythm section--Smith (Jimmie) ain't Jones (Elvin)--merits fewer solos and breaks. And despite--tsk, tsk--the electric piano on the title cut.
"
FALSE,B+,Then Play On,Fleetwood Mac,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11046,"
I put this record on a couple of months ago, noted that the famous second-rate English blues band was mixing easy ballads and Latin rhythms with the hard stuff, and forgot about it. Much, much later I tried again. Well, it's an odd amalgam but very good. Recommended to the curious.
"
FALSE,B+,Fleetwood Mac in Chicago,Fleetwood Mac,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6827,"
Combining the recently released Vols. 1 and 2, this two-LP set lets five sincere but never sedulously irrelevant (cf. John Mayall) English lads explore their branches. It almost brings you back to those distant days when ""white blues"" was more than code for ""heavy."" Knowledgeable song selection, expressive playing--especially by Peter Green, who filters B.B. King through Santo &amp; Johnny with a saxophonist's sense of line--and lots of help from Otis Spann, Willie Dixon, Shakey Horton, and others makes the thinness of the singing seem like a tribute to a new tradition.
"
FALSE,B+,Bare Trees,Fleetwood Mac,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1263,"
Their new identity is ominously mellow, but at least this time it's recognizable, and they've upped the speed a little. A lot less muddled than Future Games and occasionally as rich as Kiln House, but so thoroughly homogenized that it's hard to remember exactly how the cream tasted once it's gone down.
"
FALSE,B+,Mystery to Me,Fleetwood Mac,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6829,"
I downgraded this at first because I doubted the continuing usefulness (much less creativity) of such smooth-rocking expertise. And I still do--when they achieve the contained, ""Layla""-like freneticism of ""The City,"" their professed distaste for urban ""darkness"" insures that the breakout will be a one-shot. But this album epitomizes what they've come to be, setting a gentle but ever more technological spaceyness over a bottom that, while never explosive, does drive the music with flair and economy, the least you can expect of a band named after its rhythm section. Even Bob Welch does himself proud.
"
FALSE,B+,Tusk,Fleetwood Mac,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1266,"
A million bucks is what I call obsessive production, but for once it means something. This is like reggae, or Eno--not only don't Lindsey Buckingham's swelling edges and dynamic separations get in the way of the music, they're inextricable from the music, or maybe they are the music. The passionate dissociation of the mix is entirely appropriate to an ensemble in which the three principals have all but disappeared (vocally) from each other's work. But only Buckingham is attuned enough to get exciting music out of a sound so spare and subtle it reveals the limits of Christine McVie's simplicity and shows Stevie Nicks up for the mooncalf she's always been. Also, it doesn't make for very good background noise.
"
FALSE,B+,Mirage,Fleetwood Mac,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4799,"
This is the safe follow-up Rumours wasn't, and I find myself alternately charmed by its craft and offended by its banality. After seven years, you'd think they'd weary of romantic tension-and-release. But despite the occasional I'm-scareds and can't-go-backs, you'd never know how much passion they've already put behind them--they write about infatuation and its aftermaths like twenty-year-olds. This is obviously a commercial advantage, and I wouldn't want to be immune to its truth. But pop music offers endless variations on that truth, and since only the most graceful are worth pondering I have to say that there isn't another ""Hold Me"" here.
"
FALSE,B+,Tango in the Night,Fleetwood Mac,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4800,"
Fifteen years ago, when their secret weapon was someone named Bob Welch, they made slick, spacy, steady-bottomed pop that was a little ahead of the times commercially. Now, when their secret weapon is their public, they make slick, spacy, steady-bottomed pop that's a little behind the times commercially. This is pleasant stuff, nothing to get exercised about either way--no Rumours or Fleetwood Mac, but better than Bare Trees or Mystery to Me, not to mention Mirage. Marginally better, anyway. In a style where margins are all. And all ain't all that much any more.

Brainchild of sometime Slash editor Chris D. and featuring a saxophone and an X-rated rhythm section, this eschews the no-speed-limit egoism of El Lay punk convention for a more matoor view of the world, based on the idea that horror movies are worth taking seriously. Not bad for a laff.
"
FALSE,B+,Roman Gods,Fleshtones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4804,"
This is where they get the junk-rock down--reckless enthusiasm plus the less stylish strains of late-'60s dance music add up to their own groove. But though it's hooky and endearing, it's short on what one might call nuggets, which is why a whole side of unexceptionably jet-propelled tracks tends to lose momentum. In fact, whenever I try to concentrate for even an entire cut, my mind starts to wander, just like with Jackson Browne.

Do dirty guitars, readymade chords and bass lines, and straight four-four make this now disbanded trio garage-rock? I suppose so, though rock and roll would be a better way of putting it. Either way I'm a sucker for guys who can turn a Carl Perkins chestnut into a Velvet Underground dirge and begin something called ""Jesus Christ"" with talk of aerosol sprays--which gets us to Mace, not to mention the ozone layer, in case you were wondering.

A live double recorded mostly in '80 and '82, when their fuck-it wasn't yet a defeat, this has the spirit. But though they were anarchists they were no fools, so they put their best material on their first and forever best album, leaving the profusion of originals finally available here to bring up the rear.

If you think I enjoy enjoying this epitome of new-wave commercialism, this pap beloved of no one but MTV-addled suburbanites (not even NME, ever!)--well, you're right. I'm not just being campy, either, except insofar as camp means the luxury of surrender to stupidity--in this case to sheer, sensationalistic aural pleasure, whooshes and zooms and sustains and computerized ostinatos and English boys whining about their spaced-out, financially secure lot, all held aloft on tunes Mr. Spock could dance to. There are too many slow ones on number two, so I don't play both sides indiscriminately like I do with the debut. But hell, ""What Am I Supposed to Do"" even has a decent lyric.

FALSE,B+,Burrito Deluxe,The Flying Burrito Brothers,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3617,"
The Gilded Palace of Sin was an ominous, obsessive, tongue-in-cheek country-rock synthesis, absorbing rural and urban, traditional and contemporary, at point of impact. This is a skillful, lightweight folk-rock blend, enlivening the tempos and themes of the country music whose usages it honors. Its high point is called ""Older Guys,"" a rock (as opposed to rock and roll) idea by definition, and though songs like ""Cody, Cody"" and ""Man in the Fog""--as well as Jagger-Richard's previously unrecorded ""Wild Horses""--obviously speak from Gram Parsons's Waycross soul, they're vague enough for Chris Hillman's folkie harmonies to take them over.

There's too much art project in this five-song cassette, but fanzines hype slighter, dumber, more received stuff as if it were their holy mission, so why shouldn't I express myself? A married couple blow (flute, ocarina) and beat (chopsticks, coffee spoon, plastic fork). A buddy lays down some organ. The encomium to John Quincy Adams and the comparison of Texas and Tennessee are equally fanciful and equally educational. ""Waiting for the Catfood To Come"" is an East Village ""Afternoon Delight.""

The hosannas and precious metal showered on this slight, self-centered reentry tempt one to overlook its slight, self-centered virtues. Fogerty's drumming has definitely sharpened, though he doesn't hold up the break on ""Zanz Can't Dance"" any better than Doug Clifford would have, and cut for cut Centerfield is catchier than his previous effort--he had nine years to come up with the tunes, after all. But the material just isn't Creedence-quality. The mythopoeic genre piece ""The Old Man Down the Road"" was the keynote single not out of commercial caution but because it's the strongest thing on the record, yet does anyone claim it's the equal of ""Proud Mary"" or ""Green River"" or even ""Rockin' All Over the World""? And is anyone foolish enough to believe that the generalized ""Mr. Greed"" (not to mention the simpy ""I Saw It on T.V."") has the teeth of ""Don't Look Now"" or ""Fortunate Son,"" or that his first-ever career resum�""Centerfield"" is a personal statement to compare with ""Lookin' Out My Back Door""--in short, that the genre pieces are illuminated by visionary flashes, which is what made Creedence a great band to begin with?

With Foley's posthumous albums patchier than need be, this documentary soundtrack is where to pay your respects. Before he passed at 39, Foley's resonant voice had been roughed up by alcohol and the crusty life, but his easy flow was always something to hear. Without the five keepers it shares with the Morlix tribute, its slow ones would be hard to take--""Our Little Town"" makes six minutes feel like a sermon so long the roast gets burnt--but Morlix doesn't do ""Let Me Ride in Your Big Cadillac,"" ""Living in the Woods in a Tree,"" or ""Cosmic Doo Doo,"" and all are candidates for canonization. Too bad both records pass on ""WW III,"" ""Oval Room,"" and the jokingly, shockingly sadistic ""Springtime in Uganda."" Foley clearly never thought living in a car diminished his citizenship one little bit.

""I didn't leave my room till I learned how to drive,"" Lou Barlow recalls about being 17, which is probably why he seems retarded to this day. He's not a thug or a dolt, God knows. But he has the awkward aura of someone whose social IQ is 100 points below his math-and-verbal, and I wouldn't bet his socks always match. This is so pretty it's almost a poem about quiet lyricism--and so passive you want to put crystal meth in its apple juice.

FALSE,B+,No Friction,Fool Proof,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1277,"
""Jazzmen Play the Blues,"" says the cover sticker. Such claims have excited me unreasonably ever since I witnessed Henry Threadgill and friends back Left-Hand Frank lo these many year ago, and what could live up to that? Not this, if only because no real bluesman (as opposed to rocker) anchors it. After progressing from Delta to New Orleans to bebop to lounge-organ, it settles into jazzmen's r&amp;b, with Pheeroan akLaff staying in Al Jackson's pocket on ""Love and Happiness"" but favoring a more swinging groove. Ronnie Drayton and Bernie Worrell make some lounge act, and ""August Wilson's Urban Blue Blues"" is what a young Ornette Coleman might have come up with if he'd tried to write a ""Now's the Time""--bent bebop, blues mostly by association.
"
FALSE,B+,Long Before Our Mothers Cried,Sonny Fortune,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11274,"
Support your local jazz musicians. Fortune is a sax player whose warm-up for the Wailers at Schafer turned my head around not with its originality--Fortune is a cultivator rather than a ground-breaker--but with its commitment to plain good music, from bop to new thing. A righteous thing to do with your life, and righteous to hear. Despite even the bracing piano comps of Stanley Cowell, there's nothing compelling here. But satisfying.
"
FALSE,B+,This Girl's in Love With You,Aretha Franklin,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6853,"
Although Soul '69 didn't convince me she was made for pop standards, this (basically appealing) mish-mash suggests that she's better suited to pop disposables like the title track and ""Son of a Preacher Man"" than to rock statements like ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""The Weight."" I admit that when she sings ""The Weight"" it sounds as if she knows what it means. But I still don't.
"
FALSE,B+,Aretha's Greatest Hits,Aretha Franklin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6854,"
Great stuff, but not the greatest--and not as consistent stylistically as 1969's Aretha's Gold, which it duplicates on eight out of fourteen cuts. As for the latest hits, well, Aretha's done better recently than the contrived humankindness of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" the contrived religiosity of ""Let It Be,"" and the contrived black consciousness of ""Spanish Harlem.""
"
FALSE,B+,Amazing Grace,Aretha Franklin,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=153,"
Because I don't think God's grace is amazing or believe that Jesus Christ is his son, I find it hard to relate to gospel groups as seminal as the Swan Silvertones and the Dixie Hummingbirds and have even more trouble with James Cleveland's institutional choral style. There's a purity and a passion to this church-recorded double-LP that I've missed in Aretha, but I still find that the subdued rhythm section and pervasive call-and-response conveys more aimlessness than inspiration. Or maybe I just trust her gift of faith more readily when it's transposed to the secular realm.
"
FALSE,B+,Let Me in Your Life,Aretha Franklin,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6857,"
Welcome Tom and Jerry (Dowd and Wexler) back--this isn't great Aretha, but it rocks steady even on the ballads. If she doesn't get away with ""The Masquerade Is Over,"" she does renew ""A Song for You"" with a fresh electric piano part and a good helping of indiscreet interpretation. Guided indiscretion, that's the key--her great gift is her voice, but her genius is her bad taste.
"
FALSE,B+,With Everything I Feel in Me,Aretha Franklin,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6858,"
Aretha has established herself as such a solid property--certain to hold onto a good-sized audience for years to come, but unlikely to expand any further--that it's getting hard to resist thinking of her as a cross between Frank Sinatra and Nancy Wilson, turning out collections as custom-designed as next year's Oldsmobile. This one's more ethereal styling--less bottom, more la-la scatting--is presaged by Young, Gifted and Black's exploration of the spirituality on black pop rather than Hey Now Hey's spindrift, and I like it fine. But it's hard to get excited about an album that puts so much of its soul into the codas.
"
FALSE,B+,Jump to It,Aretha Franklin,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4816,"
Luther Vandross is a great singer, and he's gotten a great singer's album out of Aretha. But he's not a great songwriter, and great singers do their greatest work with great songs. Sometimes great singers don't even know what a great song is, which is why we get to hear Aretha perform artificial respiration on Sam Dee's ""If She Don't Want Your Lovin'"" and the Isleys' hoary ""It's Your Thing."" And sometimes great singers are also great songwriters, which is why Aretha and Luther thank their stars for Smokey's ""Just My Daydream.""
"
FALSE,B+,Get It Right,Aretha Franklin,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4817,"
As long as Luther Vandross produces her she'll never do anything awful, but she might do something bland. Vandross's problem, obviously, is songs--he does his job on the title track, but even the one by Aretha's son outclasses his other four, which I blame in part on collaborator Marcus Miller, whose bass anchors the suavely pervasive groove. His virtue, just as obviously, is that he lets Aretha sing--there's a hoarse velvet grain to her voice here that turns Michael Lovesmith's ""Better Friends Than Lovers"" into a major statement and the Temptations' ""I Wish It Would Rain"" into an Aretha song.
"
FALSE,B+,"One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism",Aretha Franklin,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4819,"
This artist-produced special-price live double comes from somewhere inside her--her soul, say--that doesn't distinguish between the personal, the political, and the religious. Structured to evoke a real church service, every side interrupted by a lengthy patch of prayer/invocation/sermon, it offers scant beat and lots of vocal glory, with much laying on of harmony. Guests include Mavis Staples, the Mighty Clouds of Joy, Jaspar Williams, and (on three sides for fourteen minutes total) Jesse Jackson. At times it seems like a self-indulgence, but more often its refusal of commercial compromise triumphs. Call it her tribute to her daddy. And never complain about her taste in clothes again.
"
FALSE,B+,Through the Storm,Aretha Franklin,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4820,"
Of the five count-'em five producers who labored over these eight tracks, only Narada Michael Walden--who claims four, including three of the four count-'em four celebrity cameos--can assure a very modern pop album. But only in spite of Walden is it a moderately seductive modern pop album. Delegating the JB duet to dodos who don't have the sense to sample him, buying noncommital generalizations even Whitney can't resist twisting, asking Elton in on the title number, the man epitomizes pop as market research. Singing her ass off on some halfway decent tunes, the artist epitomizes genius.
"
FALSE,B+,So Damn Happy,Aretha Franklin,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12120,"
No, not that ""Ain't No Way,"" or that ""Everybody's Somebody's Fool"" either. New ones, shorter on tune hence longer on voice--a musical correlative of the way she blurs the erotic-domestic details of the relationships the songs are about. Instead, her singing embodies relatedness itself: the experience of human proximity, of emotion expressed subject-to-object.
"
FALSE,B+,God's Property,Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1944,"
In extremis, choirmaster Franklin's platinum-certified, year-in-the-Billboard-200 Whatcha Lookin' 4 relied on the reflexive gospel strategy of bowling sinners over with solo vocal glory, leaving the skeptic impressed but kind of tired. Here, however, he's generally content to throw his appealing baritone over the sociable interplay of his 18 sopranos, 19 tenors, and 15 altos, thus keeping the enjoyment human-scale. And in extremis we get the gloriously obvious ""Yes We Can-Can"" and ""One Nation Under a Groove"" samples, which Kirk's host renders so much more righteous than Suge's posse you figure somebody up there has had it with the Devil getting all the good beats.

FALSE,B+,Spiders in the Moonlight,Jeffrey Frederick & the Clamtones,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6866,"
Fredericks is the secret hero of my beloved Have Moicy!, but I had to penetrate a whole lot of received music before I could be sure that his own album was more than hippie cute. What it is instead is insanely funny. Dedication: ""We would like to apologize to our mothers.""
"
FALSE,B+,The Best of Free,Free,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6870,"
I could complain that the format automatically glosses over their austerity with an uncharacteristic catchiness, but in fact it sounds better and says more about them than Highway. Just as annotator Jim Bickhart claims, the band wasn't ""only effective at gut-level; it was effective as music."" But often the gutty moves--Rodgers's or Kossoff's crowd-pleasing flourishes--weren't musical, while the arty touches--the deliberate pace and general sense of containment--socked you right in the cerebrum. Which is why Bad Company grandstands, and why I'm on the critical fence.
"
FALSE,B+,"""Chill-Out!""",Free Expression,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12048,"
Less than five minutes of fusion-vet guitar-and-rhythm, hooked on a nouveau-honk sax part and bass-man lyrics borrowed from jeans ads, with an overblown ""Save the Last Dance for Me"" on the B, this is as marginal as a decent 12-inch can be. I was all set for get about it, or hit it with a B minus. Then my malfunctioning changer played it three times in a row.
"
FALSE,B+,Exposure,Robert Fripp,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2981,"
Fripp has always been a bit of a jerk, but over the years he's figured out what to do with the talent that goes along with his affliction. This concept album earns its conceit, orchestrating bits and pieces of art-rock wisdom--from punk to Frippertronics, from King Crimson to singer-songwriter--into a fluent whole. Maybe soon he'll get smart enough to forget about J.G. Bennett. ""It is impossible to achieve the aim without suffering"" isn't exactly big news, and old Crimson fans will swallow side two without the caveat.
"
FALSE,B+,No Pussyfooting,Fripp & Eno,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2979,"
Although art-rockers praise Fripp's undulating phased guitar and Eno's mood-enhancing synthesizer drones, they also complain that it all gets a little, well, monotonous after a while. That's the problem with art-rockers--they don't know much about art. I think these two twenty-minute duets, recorded more than two years ago, are the most enjoyable pop electronics since Terry Riley's A Rainbow in Curved Air, achieving their goal with admirable formal concision. What do the bored ones want? Can't have meter shifts 'cause there's no beat, can't have bad poetry because there's no vocalist, can't have fancy chord changes 'cause there's no key center. What's left is tranquility amid the machines, more visionary and more romantic than James Taylor could dream of being. Highlight: the unrestrained snake guitar on the unfortunately titled ""Swastika Girls.""
"
FALSE,B+,Evening Star,Fripp & Eno,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2980,"
This time F&amp;E take dead aim at the hit single they so manifestly deserve by breaking their magic music into four distinct pieces on side one, but as a result I find the total effect more static--the endings are disconcertingly arbitrary, while No Pussyfooting's full sides just keep on moving. Special award for the simulated scratch that decorates ""An Index of Metals""--one of the most reassuringly fallible moments ever recorded.
"
FALSE,B+,Before We Were Born,Bill Frisell,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=304,"
He can get too abstract in both jagged and atmospheric modes, and the eclecticism signals a sideman's record: it's more impressive than meaningful to pass from hoedown to skronk in a second and harmolodic hymn next cut. But it is impressive--also fun. And unlike his predecessor Pat Metheny, Frisell needn't turn to Ornette for urban grit or deep content--which isn't to say Julius Hemphill doesn't sound right at home.
"
FALSE,B+,Can't Take You Nowhere,David Frishberg,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4827,"
""You knock back the schnapps/You talk back to cops/You walk in the room and conversation stops,"" begins the album and title tune; ""I owe it all to you,"" he tells his ""attorney Bernie"" to kick off side two. These are the things this jazzbo songwriter knows, and he knows them well enough to delight non-jazzbos with an interest in exotic subcultures. Nor will they turn down the jazzbo pianist's Ellington or Berlin. But that doesn't mean they'll buy his beliefs that Frank Loesser is a great American hero, Zoot Sims the essence of swing, and (L.A. trumpeter) Jack Sheldon ""one of the most gifted of all jazz musicians,"" presumably because he gets work as an actor. Or forgive the ecology song he produces to demonstrate he's not a cafe-society cynic.

Shades of Gang of Four, Minutemen, Mission of Burma even, to update for appearance's sake, Dismemberment Plan, one of many bands Ian MacKaye hath wrought. Punk minimalism evolved into song forms that bifurcate like art-rock. Everybody hip to tempo shifts, rhythm changes. And on this album, finally, recording equal to the tough dynamics that keep Fugazi alive as much as its integrity and idealism. Political chamber music isn't what they envisioned. But it's what they've accomplished, and an accomplishment it is.
"
FALSE,B+,Golden Filth,The Fugs,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6875,"
Not enough Tuli and a touch too much Ed, but this LP--recorded June 1, 1968, at one of their last shows--is their scush-slurfing testament. The best tune was written by William Blake under the romantic sway of a lesbian troll, but you can tell the other composers are poets too--listen to the similes break down in ""Supergirl,"" or tell me that Jim Morrison knows somebody who ""humps like a wildcat"" (or anyway, knows enough to laugh about it). The music is, well, a mess, but a purposeful mess, and Ed Sanders's poems are dirty jokes at their most divine.
"
FALSE,B+,"Fugs 4, Rounders Score",The Fugs,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6876,"
Previously unreleased (Holy Modal) Rounders oldies (the original ""Romping Through the Swamp"") plus a mid-'60s best-of on the original rock-poets, with ample room for the musical genius of Tuli Kupferberg--including ""Morning, Morning"" in a version far lovelier than Spyder Turner's and the peristaltic ""Caca Rocka,"" a/k/a ""Pay Toilet Blues."" The musicianship will offend the fastidious and loses even me at times. But there's a sense in which the halting drone of these sessions, vaguely reminiscent of the early Velvets, is more appropriate to the Fugs' secondhand rock than all the classy folkies they later patched on.
"
FALSE,B+,Refuse to Be Burnt-Out,The Fugs,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4831,"
Rarely has an aging hippie lost his sense of humor with more grace than Ed Sanders, who could be wild-ass and even a little nasty on what looked like the brink of cultural triumph but turned careful and considerate once he realized the struggle might never end. Instead of degenerating into a ""bitterly bickering bitter-shitter,"" he's put his youthful idealism front and center. His laughs are gentle, word choices rather than jokes; with special help from Steve Taylor, latest in the proud line of folkie-Fugs, his lyricism is resilient, reedlike; and he preaches with sounder grounding in moral philosophy than Holly Near and Johnny Rotten combined. As for Tuli Kupferberg, who was in his forties when it all began, praise the Lord--he hasn't lost a bit of his youthful sarcasm.

Three pleasantly unkempt songs by a concept comprising Fleshtones guitarist Keith Streng, who plays almost everything, and R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, who plays guitar. The best is about owning a car. The second-best is what they like about the South.

FALSE,B+,Waiting,Fun Boy Three,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4836,"
From ""Our Lips Are Sealed,"" proof that a ""definitive AOR version"" (as the sticker calls it) can negotiate between cheery veneer and breast-beating bullshit, to ""Well Fancy That!,"" proof that not everyone who has problems with ""boy love"" (as men call it) is as self-serving as Howard Smith, David Byrne's production suits songwriting that has advanced beyond the undernourishment of their breakaway debut. ""Farmyard Connection"" lays out the class inequities of herb production. Elsewhere they're not in love with love.
"
FALSE,B+,Maggot Brain,Funkadelic,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1305,"
Children, this is a funkadelic. The title piece is ten minutes of classic Hendrix-gone-heavy guitar by one Eddie Hazel--time-warped, druggy superschlock that may falter momentarily but never lapses into meaningless showoff runs. After which comes 2:45 of post-classic soul-group harmonizing--two altos against a bass man, all three driven by the funk, a rhythm so pronounced and eccentric it could make Berry Gordy twitch to death. The funk pervades the rest of the album, but not to the detriment of other peculiarities. Additional highlight: ""Super Stupid.""
"
FALSE,B+,Standing on the Verge of Getting It On,Funkadelic,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1308,"
Although too often it lives up to its title, this is the solidest record this restless group has ever made (under its own name--cf. Parliament) and offers such goodies as Alvin Chipmunk saying ""gross mutherfucker"" and a stanza that takes on both Iggy Stooge and Frank Zappa with its tongue tied. It also offers this Inspirational Homily: ""Good thoughts bring forth good fruit. Bullshit thoughts rot your needs. Think right and you can fly.""
"
FALSE,B+,Tales of Kidd Funkadelic,Funkadelic,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1311,"
As with James Brown, whose circa-1971 J.B.'s provided this band with its horns and rhythm section, there always seem to be waste cuts on George Clinton's albums. The difference is that Brown's are intended as filler even when they come out inspired, whereas Clinton's feel like scientific experiments even when they're entirely off-the-cuff. The title cut here, a thirteen-minute congas-and-keyboard reconnaissance decorated with a few chants, turns out to be fairly listenable. Which I noticed because it's preceded by a catchy march called ""I'm Never Gonna Tell It,"" their greatest post-doowop experiment yet. Also out there: ""Take Your Dead Ass Home!"" Not to mention the horns and rhythm section.
"
FALSE,B+,Uncle Jam Wants You,Funkadelic,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1313,"
This is fairly wonderful through the first cut on side two, but in a fairly redundant way. Bernie Worrell's high synthesizer vamps sometimes seem like annoying cliches these days, and not even Philippe Wynne can provide the marginal variety that puts good groove music over the top--maybe because he sounds like a high synthesizer himself.
"
FALSE,B+,Reachin a Level of Assassination,Funkytown Pros,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1317,"
All clenched throat and quick internal rhymes, Boiwundah disdains ""white green,"" and he knows how to brag: ""I'm the debate master, you're just a masturbator."" Even stronger ""coffee with no cream"" comes from his DJ cousin Devastatin', who states his business with a ""Big Payback"" loop and never retreats. At their most bodacious--check the twisted horn intro/refrain on ""Here Me Now, Believe Me Later,"" which could have been ripped bleeding from late Miles or choice Art Ensemble--his beats are as out as JB's spaciest and jazziest. In short, this unaffiliated L.A. crew deserves better than to go down in the juice wars.
"
FALSE,B+,Fusion,Fusion,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11528,"
Intelligent incorporation of pure blues into a hard-rock framework, beautifully played and arranged, with a forgivable touch of pseudo-spade in the singing. Reminiscent of Steppenwolf, but more flexible (two vocalists). Worth a chance.

Released shortly after Honest failed to catapult Atlanta's solidest trap-pop hope into a Jingle Baller and longer after babymama Ciara started saving it for a Christian quarterback, this mixtape doesn't bother with radio-friendly. Far from it. Before it sinks slowly into the generic, it justifies openers claiming ""Radical"" and ""Monster"" with a five-track sequence that begins with the club hit ""Fuck Up Some Commas,"" ends with the outrageously catchy ""2 Pac,"" scoops up a fine Lil Wayne 16 along the way, and never tops ""Throw Away,"" a truer love song for Ciara than any hook machine he'd hoped would cross over: ""I came home last night to a menage/Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you/I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you/When you're fucking another nigga I hope you're thinking about me."" Actually painful. Strong like pop so seldom is. Vulnerable like pop so seldom is too.

FALSE,B+,The Futureheads,The Futureheads,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12669,"
There's that Ramones sense that songs should be short like life, and that XTC sense that songs should be complicated like life. So who could expect these young Brits to understand life, except to suggest, sometimes observantly and sometimes rhetorically, that it's dangerous? They don't fulfill the promise of the wonderful title ""The City Is Here for You to Use."" But they do make the most of the bitter novelty ""First Day,"" which starts fast and ends double-time, just like that job they were so lucky to get.
"
FALSE,B+,Federation of Tackheads,Jimmy G. and the Tackheads,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4851,"
Those who bewail George Clinton's drum-program conversion should get a load of the rhythm chip he has working on this collaboration with former Slave laborer and master of his own Aurra Steve Washington--not to mention Mr. G., a kid brother George hopes to save from a life of petty crime and presidential aspiration. The industrial-strength whomp of these willfully simple-minded tracks makes the big beat of the notorious ""Hydraulic Pump"" sound like something Trick James might cross over on. One nice thing about simple-minded--when it hits you you feel all right.
"
FALSE,B+,Regulate . . . G Funk Era,Warren G,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4136,"
Where his homeboy Snoop plays a well-chilled sociopath whose indifference to pain is the centerpiece of his carefully plotted menace, Dr. Dre's kid half-brother is more like a mischievous seventh-grader. Giggling at Bootsy's funny glasses one minute, selling crack on the corner the next, he could go either way, or both in tandem. His cool and his tough are less practiced, less cocksure, hence more dangerous--and more tragic. Teamed with the tunefully murderous Nate Dogg, he's nasty in a new, neurotic way. Giving work to the Twinz or Dove Shack, he's one more G.

FALSE,B+,Peter Gabriel,Peter Gabriel,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2734,"
Even when he was Genesis, Gabriel seemed smarter than your average art-rocker. Though the music was mannered, there was substance beneath its intricacy; however received the lyrical ideas, they were easier to test empirically than evocations of spaceships on Atlantis. This solo album seems a lot smarter than that. But every time I delve beneath its challenging textures to decipher a line or two I come up a little short.

FALSE,B+,Today,Galaxie 500,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1322,"
With their strained, murmuring Sprechgesang, half-speed raveups, and sobbing guitar, they evoke circa-""Pale Blue Eyes"" Velvets so beautifully you think they're an imitation until you recheck the original. Instead it's like Today's supposed to be as soft and gawky compared to The Velvet Underground as that album was up against The Velvet Underground and Nico. Like Jonathan Richman, source of the sole cover, they're sweet young aesthetes who love the Velvets without making them role models. ""I'd rather stay in bed with you/Until it's time to get a drink""--what kind of decadent is that?

FALSE,B+,Gap Band IV,Gap Band,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4855,"
Although women may disagree, I don't think the cartoon sincerity of Bootsy and the Ohio Players will ever evolve into romantic credibility. So while I'm not saying these total entertainers sound like Huey, Louie &amp; Dewey on the slow ones, I insist that they don't sound like the Temptations either--vocally, they're mere professionals singing merely professional love songs. Which isn't to deny that the funk tunes burn rubber and the funktoons drop the bomb.
"
FALSE,B+,Gap Band V: Jammin',Gap Band,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4856,"
Like Cameo and Rick James before them, these old pros blew their sure shots on the breakthrough--this drops no bombs. But once again the follow-up album compensates for never getting up by never letting up--the uptempo stuff steadfastly maintains their hand-stamped party groove, and like Cameo (forget Rick James), they've figured out what to do with the slow ones. That Stevie Wonder move is a no-fail--just ask George Benson, or Eddie Murphy.

FALSE,B+,Gap Gold: Best of the Gap Band,Gap Band,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4857,"
What a waste. If ever a band cried out for that corny old fast side/slow side split, it's the creators of ""Burn Rubber,"" ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me,"" ""Early in the Morning,"" and, God spare you, ""Season's No Reason To Change."" Taken in a single rush, the uptempo classics (augmented by a few expert imitations, including ""Party Trains""'s imitation Gap Band) would stand as twenty-five minutes of rock and roll so spectacular you'd never think to turn the damn thing over.

FALSE,B+,Garcia,Jerry Garcia,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6881,"
Side one sounds almost too pleasant and catchy, as if Garcia and Robert Hunter--the most consistent songwriters anywhere over the past couple of years--had settled a little too comfortably into the slow, traditional, blues-tinged country-rock groove the Dead have been digging recently. The payoff is ""Sugaree"" and ""Deal,"" classics no future-rocker could come up with. And then--surprise!--the second side balances (surprisingly unpretentious) musique concrete experimentation against the groove.

I complained about production clutter on her quickly deleted Arista album, but I must admit that David Rubinson injected a brightness that I miss in El Lay jazzman John Guerin's more tasteful work here. That could even be why the songs seem a shade duller this time. But Garthwaite's rhythmic and timbral adeptness remain unique in rock, and I'm grateful these days for any explicitly feminist analysis that is also both heterosexual and antipuritanical. Anyway, the songs are still a lot brighter than most.

FALSE,B+,What's Going On,Marvin Gaye,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2282,"
This may be a groundbreaking personal statement, but like any Berry Gordy quickie it's baited skimpily: only three great tunes. ""What's Going On,"" ""Inner City Blues,"" and ""Mercy, Mercy Me (the Ecology)"" are so original they reveal ordinary Motown-political as the benign market manipulation it is. And Gaye keeps getting more subtle vocally and rhythmically. But the rest is pretty murky even when the lyrical ideas are good--I like the words on ""What's Happenin' Brother"" and ""Flyin' High (in the Friendly Sky)"" quite a bit--and the religious songs that bear Gaye's real message are suitably shapeless. Worst of all, because they're used a lot, are David Van De Pitte's strings, the lowest kind of movie-background dreck.
"
FALSE,B+,Here My Dear,Marvin Gaye,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6890,"
The brightness of the disco remix Motown has made available on ""A Funky Space Reincarnation"" is a vivid reminder of how pathologically laid back Gaye is striving to be. I mean, seventy minutes of pop music with nary a melody line almost qualifies as a tour de force, and the third side barely escapes the turntable at all. Yet this is a fascinating, playable album. Its confessional ranges from naked poetry (""Somebody tell me please/Why do I have to pay attorney fees?"" is a modernist trope that ranks with any of Elvis Costello's) to rank jive, because Gaye's self-involvement is so open and unmediated, guileless even at its most insincere, it retains unusual documentary charm. And within the sweet, quiet, seductive, and slightly boring mood Gaye is at such pains to realize, his rhythmic undulations and whisper-to-a-scream timbral shifts can engross the mind, the body, and above all the ear. Definitely a weird one.

Not only does this lead off with ""I Will Survive"" (which I--unlike most--find too long in the eight-minute version now included on the repressed album), and ""Stoplight,"" a piece of inspired girl-group foolishness, it winds down into commendable filler-plus. Faves: ""You Can Exit"" (""If you don't like the size/If you don't like the fit"" of what?) and ""Anybody Wanna Party"" (which for once might induce me to). A better--and cuter--Freddie Perren album than Best of the Sylvers.

FALSE,B+,The Godfather of Rap,Spoonie Gee,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4860,"
Spoonie is so unreconstructed he talks the same old shit without even pretending he made it up--a little romantic vulnerability (not much) is as venturesome as he gets thematically. His rhymes'll sneak up on you, though, and his groove is so old it's new. Surprising a Mike Tyson fan is such a counterpuncher; Lee Dorsey as JB, he doesn't float like a butterfly--more like a waterbug on a shore current. Marley Marl is his match, deploying riff and dub and dissonance with a laggardly subtlety that'll pass hotbloods right by. So let me put it this way--Spoonie probably thinks Bob Marley stole his handle from Marl, and he's still the first rapper to come by his reggae naturally.

FALSE,B+,Monkey Island,Geils,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6898,"
For no good historical reason--1977 is hardly the year of white r&amp;b--this marginally offensive boogie cartoon has suddenly put together twenty minutes of music as consistent as side two of its 1970 debut. A hard one and a soft one and a cover and a closet-intellectual one and a pretty good one--that's their gamut, right? Overdisc, the nine-minute title track bombs and the other originals fail to take off, but the band does a number on Louis Armstrong's ""I'm Not Rough,"" splitting the hard part between Magic Dick's harp and J.'s guitar. So give 'em a hand, folks--they earned it.
"
FALSE,B+,The J. Geils Band,The J. Geils Band,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6893,"
I find this gritty Jewish r&amp;b band from Boston fun but somewhat retrogressive, which is admittedly the way I once felt about Creedence. Side two pops out of the box with covers from Otis Rush and the Contours and then slows down in style with two originals that deserve to get covered back. But the vocals don't do much for John Lee Hooker (no surprise) and the two instrumentals hobble the album's build (also no surprise, since great r&amp;b instrumentals are almost as hard to come by as great white blues singers).
"
FALSE,B+,Freeze-Frame,The J. Geils Band,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4862,"
For me, their best since Monkey Island if not the debut divides neatly into three groups of three: slick get-me-off trash (hit single plus two music-as-escape songs), slick get-'em-off trash (opener, closer, and ""Angel in Blue,"" a whore with a heart of brass that I'm just a sucker for), and slick get-offa-me trash (two throwaways at the end of side one plus ""River Blindness,"" a more pretentious try at ""Monkey Island,"" that album's sole bumout). If you're discovering the great audience these days it might even change your life for a month. But I guarantee you it didn't change the band's.

This punk band's notorious commitment to pop is evident mostly in surprising harmonies and song structures--musically, they're not trying to be cute. And although as singles ""Your Generation,"" ""Ready Steady Go,"" and ""Wild Youth"" never knocked my socks off, they're the nucleus of a tough, consistent, inventive album.

Forget bars 'n' barbeque--the 24-hour eatery of the title tune belongs to Dan Baird's new sweetie (""I just got to know if that thing is open all night""), who shouldn't be confused with ""Mon Cheri"" (""Her skirt rolled up and I could see she was French""). I know, I know, but trust me when I say their appetite makes up for their boogie recidivism. Sure they'd like to be the Stones, but they're smart enough to know they won't make it and young enough to take their fun where they can get it.

These days singer-songwriters are as likely to start out in Nashville as end up there, and though this literary thirty-five-year-old loves words too much to keep it simple and celebrated his big break by recording in London, he's a country boy at heart. When he falls in love he hears crickets and jackrabbits, when he tunes a diesel it sings like Patsy Cline, and when he gets to thinking about barn burnings and ""suicide amortization"" he writes one called ""Political."" Even his Dylanesque turns have their poetry, and if he betrays both his muse and his immigrant forebears with ""God Ain't No Stained Glass Window,"" just remember--country boys always sink into bathos when they approach the Almighty.

Carried beginning to end by force of vocal personality, the songs on this exceptionally unredundant 2007 mixtape are mostly undeveloped, as is standard for mixtapes. What isn't standard is that the guy with his name on the insert card is on all but two of the 23, and that one of the exceptions cuts tedious old Trife da God with excited young Termanology. Authorized Beyonce and unauthorized Amy Winehouse change things up, as does the mellow young thing whose ""to be with you my love"" replaces tedious young Carl Thomas on a ""Never Be the Same"" remix. Not that she isn't a two-timing heartsore anyway.

Neither of Gibbons's first two albums convinced me that the world needed a young Bob Seger--which meant among other things a craftsman who hadn't yet mastered his craft. But this time he's writing 'em and picking 'em with a sharp nose for the cliche. Assholes the world over cover Berry and Dylan on the live album, but they won't risk unrecognized classics like ""Tulane"" and ""Watching the River Flow,"" which is why they're assholes. And how many other craftsmen could imagine a mock myth called ""Gave His Life to Rock 'n' Roll""?

Produced, written, and directed (but not sung) by August Darnell of Dr. Buzzard, this begins with the seduction sequence from a fantastical '40s shipboard movie, establishing a tropical mood that pervades the record--sometimes lyrically, always musically--through its finale, ""Winter on Riverside Drive."" Like Dr. Buzzard, Gichy Dan mixes nostalgic fun and urban realism into something exotic. And though the melodies aren't always there, the life and imagination that were wrung out of Dr. Buzzard's second album have returned.
"
FALSE,B+,Human Race/Ra���,Gilberto Gil,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8238,"
How readily songs breach the language barrier varies inversely with how verbal they are. As engaging as Gil's vocabulary of trills, growls, whoops, keens, and discretionary phonemes may be, he's also a careful wordsmith, and listeners who don't know Portuguese feel an absence unallayed by universalist title or Jamaican rhythm section (though a printed translation might help). Which makes the relative legibility of Um Banda Um all the more miraculous--though it's worth noting that that title sounds like discretionary phonemes to this English speaker.

FALSE,B+,Expresso 2222,Gilberto Gil,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15461,"
Gil's first post-exile album included just nine songs in 1973, was picked up by three seamlessly upbeat bonus tracks in 1993, and kept them in its 2008 U.S. edition. Dimmed by three years of firsthand London fog, his Anglophile popcraft immerses in carioca beats and funky acoustic guitar worthy of Brazil's future minister of culture, often too much so--the grooveful six-minute ""Oriente"" is downright dull. Fortunately, most of the tracks chew banana-flavored Chiclets and take their samba with bebop on the side.

FALSE,B+,The Giant,Dizzy Gillespie,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11517,"
It's gratifying to hear how little the performing vitality of one of the creators of bebop has diminished over three decades; he's still making satisfying records. Personally, I prefer this twofer (a 1973 Paris session that features Johnny Griffin, Kenny Drew and Kenny Clarke) to the more recent Dizzy Gillespie Big 4 (done for Pablo Records with Joe Pass, Ray Brown, and Mickey Roker) because it stresses raunch and rhythm. But both albums are survivor's music: loose and quick-witted, almost untouched by the fierce inward turning that drove so many beboppers into one dead end or another. And that's probably just the reason that both lack the sense of conceptual urgency that hooked me on bebop.
"
FALSE,B+,Powerplant,Girlpool,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17051,"
Far be it from me to encourage punky minimalists to Learn Their Instruments on the path to Peace Through Art or Big Bucks. Too often that's a not-so-shortcut to sterile formalism or creepy-crawly commercialism. Yet the dream-pop these Philly-based Angeleno BFFs have worked up achieves a surprising softness, vulnerability, dynamic range, and melodicism. Cleo Tucker's guitar articulates and Harmony Tividad's bass complicates as some guy named Miles bangs the drums supportively. The only hitch is all the Explore Your Poeticism. More ""You'll build him a tower and he'll burn you a bridge,"" please. I want to know what you're driving at, meandering toward, or both.

Since these five females or others of the same name have been doing the old forced march since 1980, I assume the crucial exuberance of their recycled Sweet-metal is something of a simulation. But second-hand cock-rock it ain't--no rape threatened or implied. Just show business.
"
FALSE,B+,Symbol of Reality,The Gladiators,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4900,"
Albert Griffiths has never been a musical fundamentalist--1979's Sweet So Till, the group's first self-produced LP and only previous U.S. release, placed too much faith in synths, and when that didn't go over they went in with Eddy Grant, which didn't go over either--so maybe he's joined the Itals on this roots-conscious label because he's got nowhere else to go. But the same sense of pithy conviction that made Proverbial Reggae a classic album makes this a good one. The revival of the anthemic ""Dreadlocks the Time Is Now"" is no more impressive than the proverbial ""Mister Goose,"" which unfortunately is the only song about women here that bespeaks as much loving wisdom as the songs about Jah.

FALSE,B+,Einstein on the Beach,Philip Glass/Robert Wilson,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2763,"
I'd skip the Rolling Stones to witness this five-hour maximalization of minimalism again, but on record--condensed to four discs running about three hours--I find that its operatic conceit justifies itself all too well. This is ""great,"" all right, but without Wilson's spectacular visuals it's also, to these pop-happy ears, tedious and sometimes even pompous. In short, I'm glad to own it, but it didn't cost me twenty-five bucks, and I don't know when I'll find time to play it again now that I've done so twice.

""I've got a feeling, sounds like a fact/It's been around as long as that,"" goes my favorite hook of the past few months, which is something of an aberration: in the great tradition of post-modern pop these folky-arty Aussies abjure melody much of the time, though the second side does begin to sing after a few plays, and after much longer the textures on the first assume a mnemonic aura as well. A little static for rock and roll, but as poetry reading goes, quite kinetic.
"
FALSE,B+,Bright Yellow Bright Orange,The Go-Betweens,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11877,"
They say they're a band again, and I believe them--bye Forster, bye McLennan, welcome back Forster-McLennan. What I don't believe is that they're as integral or rocking a band as they once were, or that the strummy arrangements turn back on themselves like they should. But after longer than any neutral party will wait, the songs flower if not bloom into tints subtler than the noontime hues of the title. I don't mean the opener, which snaps into place with a classic identiriff, or the one where Robert wants to go to Brazil. Those are quick. I mean every single song. Too slow, too slight, still remarkable.

FALSE,B+,Ruins: The Complete Works of God and the State,God and the State,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4866,"
They played a typical minimalist grunge-funk in L.A. in 1983. The guitarist now studies philosophy in Toronto, the bassist architecture in Italy; the drummer has sold his kit. And on the cover they're considerate enough to provide their own review: ""The record was produced in ten hours, for $200 (US). There are a lot of jokes in the songs; but some listeners don't think they're funny, and others don't even think they're jokes, rather symptoms of spiritual decay. There is an intended message of hope, of finding power in yourself against domination and power's corruption; but some find the songs cynical and as glib as the clever people they occasionally denounce.""

Though the former Surf Punk is in it strictly for laughs, ""I know it's been done before/All my songs about boring stuff"" is as close as these six tracks some to a quotable joke. Though he varies his singing comedian's monotone with the occasional inflection or preverbalism, delivery isn't his secret either. And though the generically catchy, vaguely apt arrangements can make me smile all by themselves, I couldn't tell you why. Maybe there's something intrinsically funny about Southern California.

Unlike so many groups who live and die by the hook, this one's got hooks, and when you pay attention to the lyrics it seems possible that they don't live and die by the hook at all--""Tonite"" and ""Skidmarks on My Heart,"" to choose but two unprepossessing examples, work subtle twists on teen fatalism and obsession, respectively. When you don't pay attention to the lyrics, which isn't hard, you begin to think they live and die by the hook after all. And you're probably right.

FALSE,B+,Visions of Excess,The Golden Palominos,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3640,"
As formal experiments go, this packs quite a wallop, and not just because a drummer supervised the mix--Anton Fier clearly loves and understands that much-mocked arena-rock megawattage. But a formal experiment it remains, because neither guitars not voices carry meaning of their own. Jody Harris has always had a weakness for the genre exercise (as has Mike Hampton, for that matter), and the five stellar singer-lyricists sound like they were brought in to finish the tracks. Even in arena-rock that's not how it's done.

In antithetical ways, ""Train Across Ukraine"" and ""Citizen Boris"" are civics lessons for ""travelers third class,"" now known as ""workers seeking green cards."" But mostly the klezmer band that thinks a trombone makes you Balkan brass turns to the languages of love, including both English and the rhythmic invocations of a medium-raucous Yiddish-Gypsy wedding. Maybe you don't know what ""Tucheses and Nenes"" are. Lenny Bruce did, though. And you'll figure it out.

Their drawls as thick as their funk, they create a Dirty South at once more impenetrable and more inviting than Eightball's or Master P's--in feeling, one of hip hop's most neighborly spaces. Musically and verbally, they're too textural, but not even OutKast cultivates such territory with such care, and their Allmans homage/rip is almost as inspirational as this preachment: ""I'm sick of lyin'/I'm sick of glorifyin' dyin'/I'm sick of not tryin'.""

Finally free of the spend-money-to-make-money fallacy, a likable cult folkie puts together his most modest and most likable album. True, he's too sentimental when he's serious; even when he's funny he's too sentimental. His natural lyricism is a palliative, though, and when he's funny (about half the time) he's funny.""Vegematic"" and ""Talk Backward"" and the cruelly antinuke ""Watchin' Joey Glow"" may be easy jokes, but I ask you, why did the chicken cross the road? Hope he sells at least ten thousand.

Lyrically, Kanye &amp; Assoc. do little more than add ho and gangsta sidebars to the boss's core philosophy: ""Conspicuous Consumption Equals Authentic Negritude."" Usual suspects Pusha T and Raekwon sound better working this con than young jurks Big Sean and Chief Keef, and there's cleverness all around, with my pick the boss chorus ""We flier than a parakeet/Floating with no parachute/Six thousand dollar pair of shoes/We made it to the Paris news."" But close attention to the rhyming reveals all too clearly that the philosophy has gotten even lamer than it was to begin with. The surprise is that the attention requires so little effort, because there's always a musical touch to keep you alert: strings chamber and pizzicato, shouts and murmurs, cackles and whoos, glitches of every description, and a predictably unpredictable panoply of percussives. As with the virtual naturescapes in Samuel Delany's Stars in My Pockets Like Grains of Sand, you may never touch Gucci, but you'll know the texture of luxury just the same. And that better the hell be enough.

Listed at $7.98, this offers more than 100 minutes of well-recorded music from the master of bop tenor and group, and its availability is gratifying, but trumpeter Woody Shaw plays and composes like the worthy journeyman he is, and I know that when I want to hear recent live Dexter I'll turn to one of the European blowing sessions with Jackie McLean (I prefer The Source to The Meeting) now available here on Inner City. Even more scintillating musically (although duller aurally) is the Blue Note twofer, Dexter Gordon, featuring performances from the early 60's and lots of great sidemen. And if Savoy's Long Tall Dexter, from the middle '40s didn't run all the alternate takes together, it would probably be the best of all.

Gordon's affectless downtown tone sticks in my craw even though I've learned to have fun with it in other versions. But at least his new mewzick isn't deliberately cheesy. It's kitsch, but it's not cheap kitsch, not factitious so-bad-it's-good; in another time, snobs might have branded it middlebrow, meaning dolts like you and me think it has substance. As a here-disco there-jazz everywhere-semiavant soundtrack to life in media central, kind of fun--though more resistant than fun, or mood music, should ever be.

FALSE,B+,Brooklyn,Peter Gordon,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4877,"
On side two he's up to his usual tricks if not regressing a bit--first three cuts no better than the schlocky instrumental disco-rock they postmodernize, last cut no better than the pretty kora exotica it exploits (which if you're following means it's literally pretty--very, in fact). But side one, how about that, has real words--which are, it took me months to accept this, evocative (""Brooklyn""), romantic (""'Til We Drop""), and funny (""Red Meat""). In an oblique way, but Gordon's problem isn't that he's oblique, it's that he's too oblique. The right dose of oblique can be tonic in this crash-boom world.

""Oh, who's that? Oh, oh that's your girl, you're with her? She looks like everyone else in heah."" The dis caps a spoken-not-rapped intro mini-skit, and the intonation is perfect: Jay-Z in cute braggart mode. Grae can rhyme, and if she had a male larynx and a production budget (plus a little luck and additional applications of promotional muscle), her hype men, chipmunk soul, minor-key piano hooks, and ""I wanna rock a fella so bad"" might stand underground on its head. But she doesn't have those things; she's an ""insecure failure/Can barely maintain I wanna scream like Mahalia."" Thus her triumph remains strictly aesthetic, and pretty strange, which in the long run can only increase her insecurity. She needs a message bad.

This strictly post-Terry Knight compilation confirms my belief that they did most of their worthwhile recording with Todd Rundgren, although ""Bad Time"" and ""Some Kind of Wonderful,"" from their first collaboration with Jimmy Ienner, are definitive plusses. The strategy is clear in retrospect--back to their junk-rock roots with ? and the Mysterians and maybe even Terry Knight &amp; the Pack. Recycling riffs, upping the tempos, shuffling their limited vocal resources, and projecting the same populist sincerity that always made them more than a hype, they fuse their heavy beginnings with the hooks they were originally too mythic to bother with on this creditable testament.

The most spectacular of the Sugarhill crews on stage is also the hookiest on record, thanks to Flash's spinning--he can make his turntables give forth like a horn section of kazoos or electric soprano saxophones. But if ""Freedom,"" their Sugarhill debut, made aural graffiti-writing seem like a political act, here they remind us of its nuisance potential--it's fun to hear the Five's birthdays, and nice that each of us has one, but the idea is thin and so is Flash's hook.

Establishing vocal individuality without entering the cartoon territory that is funk's comic blessing and romantic/realistic curse, they locate rap somewhere to the left of the hardest hard funk tradition, James Brown circa ""Sex Machine"" and ""Mother Popcorn,"" rocking the body by pushing the beat (like Trouble Funk or the Treacherous Three) rather than teasing it (like Spoonie Gee or Soul Sonic Force). This almost athletic physical excitement, this willed and urgent hope, has been the core of their real message no matter what party slogan or all-night boast they've set it to. It's a disgrace that Sylvia Robinson's latest attempt to cash in their rep fades away to the forty-five edits that never did a thing for them--even ""The Message,"" which doesn't lose a word except its coda, surrenders an unbearable tension along with its instrumental breaks. Culturally depriveds who don't own such twelve-inches as ""Birthday Party,"" ""It's Nasty,"" and ""The Message"" itself are advised to settle if they have no choice.

When he's most original, Melle Mel's political chops are startling: ""Hustler's Convention"" closes with a right-on analysis, ""World War III"" resists thanatos and reminds Vietnam vets that they were dumb to go. But with Rahiem and Creole and Flash gone, idealism and romance are totally perfunctory, and original clearly ain't where they're heading: from the Prince rip to the Run-D.M.C. rip--both expert, enjoyable, even a little innovative--they come off as 1984's answer to the Sugarhill Gang, pros whose aim in life is to make more than chump change off whatever's on the street. Also, they can't sing.

There's an expediency to Grant's songwriting--try ""Latin Love Affair,"" or the equally routine ""Funky Rock 'n' Roll,"" or a rhyme like ""My heart does a tango/I love you like a mango""--that makes it hard to believe he's a hero. Instead of drawing some Caribbean analogy, I'd compare him to the Isley Brothers--artist-entrepreneurs with good intentions and a good assembly line. Of course, there's a ramshackle quality to the assembly line that saves even its most expedient product from slickness, and this is far from that--except on the hard-to-find Live at Notting Hill import, his good intentions have never been more out front.

This live triple is where everybody except certified Grateful Dead freaks gets off the bus, but I've still got my card and it ain't a joker. Sure they're beginning to sound very complacent--the whole ""Morning Dew"" side could be scratched, and the long version of ""Truckin'"" proves conclusively that the song doesn't truck much. But the best stuff here--the ensemble playing on ""Sugar Magnolia,"" the movement of ""China Cat Sunflower,"" Garcia's It Hurts Me Too"" solo, the lyric to ""Ramble On Rose""--is a lot more than laid-back good. It's laid-back brilliant. Most of the rest, patchy though it may be, is laid-back good. Also, I like the way they sing. (And write.)

Now, done with that id shit, she finds her voice by pleading with her man to stay or come back as the case may be. Her big argument: ""She Don't Write Songs About You."" She's pretty, she's rich, she cooks, she reads, she keeps house, she gives good head. Macy will grant all that. But she don't write songs.

FALSE,B+,Covered,Macy Gray,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15647,"
Ten non-Gray songs, three comedy skits, and three brief cameos for her kids and their high school pals. The songs are all post-1980, meaning post-song--from the era when bands began distinguishing themselves by sound. Credit producer Hal Wilner with isolating the melodically verbal in Metallica, Radiohead, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sublime, My Chemical Romance, and lesser lights. But 1) the high point is the opening ""Here Comes the Rain Again,"" an anthem on the face of it that Gray wrests from Annie Lennox forever; 2) a low point is the closer from the anthemic-on-the-face-of-it Arcade Fire, a major structural mishap; and 3) an even lower point is the Metallica centerpiece, which could be my problem but I bet isn't. Casting directors should note that the comedy skits are genuinely funny; Gray should note that I'm omitting the cameos when I put this in iTunes. But both are distractions. Fun as it is to hear her do ""Creep,"" ""Teenagers,"" and ""Smoke Two Joints,"" this is a bigger mess than it had to be.

Even though Ron House's whiny monotone gravitates toward the same melody no matter the song, each folk-punk arrangement stands out, and the lyrics show a sense of Americana worthy of a band from Columbus, Ohio--college town, state capital, boondock. Ever since high school I've been waiting for a rock and roll song about Mark Hanna, and I didn't even know it.

If they don't quite live up to titles like ""Chuck Berry's Orphan,"" ""Dick Clark,"" and ""Fertile Crescent,"" who could? If their organ-drenched four-four jams are objectively boring, they'll make you hum and pat anyway. If the organ-hooked ""Letter to a Fanzine"" is the sole masterstroke, hard-to-resists are almost legion. And if ""Why do punk rock guys go out with new wave girls"" is part of the parody, I bet these punk-wavers know the answer from experience.

FALSE,B+,Length of Growth 1981-89,Great Plains,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6142,"
Every goddamn drone and whine Ron House and his Columbus friends ever released, 50 songs that evoke both the punk that set them off and the alt-country they spied coming down the road. Quick, kids, where do the Great Plains start? Well west of Columbus, right? And by the way, who was this Mark Hanna guy? Pol behind four presidents fROMOHIO, two of whom were assassinated and one of whom Great Plains did a song about. Other subjects include Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Martin Luther, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Dick Clark, the fate of the family farm, how bad onetime Voice crit Don Howland has to piss, and, most famously, why punk rock boys go out with new wave girls. Not all of it is great, some of it is barely good, and I doubt even his thesis advisor would listen to House caterwauling 50 straight songs. But he knows that, and he wants you to hear them all anyway--surely you don't think he's in it for the money. A single album by Canton's own Marilyn Manson will cost you more than both CDs.

FALSE,B+,Al Green Explores Your Mind,Al Green,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=62,"
At first I found this a depressing combination of trivial ambitions and simple greed--the hit, ""Sha-La-La,"" is his slightest to date, and side two might easily have been unflattened with a cover. But I kept playing ""Sha-La-La"" to reach ""Take Me to the River,"" a synthesis of the spiritual root of Green's music (call it God) and its emotional referent (by which I mean sex) that may be his greatest song. And in the end I loved ""Sha-La-La"" too.
"
FALSE,B+,Have a Good Time,Al Green,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=66,"
Green's recent instability is usually blamed on hot grits and the short half-life of formula soul, but I'm beginning to wonder whether drummer Al Jackson, who died in 1975, wouldn't have steadied the last two albums, and I expect that this is an attempt to compensate. Wilson Pickett it ain't, but it is the straightest (and hardest) soul Green has put out since his breakthrough--the horns way up, the vocals shouting confidence and technique. Problem is, it's forced--the Hi folks (like most of their peers) can't turn out songs distinctive enough to hold up under the treatment. It's still full of fire, though, and Green is still the finest popular singer of the decade, and I'm still gratified to see him on his feet.
"
FALSE,B+,Truth n' Time,Al Green,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=69,"
Reports that Green was no longer writing all his own material worried some supporters, but in fact composition has counted for very little in Green's recent work and is generally improved here. This is his most careful and concise music since Livin' for You; in fact, it's too damn concise, clocking in at 26:39 for eight cuts, although the sustaining 6:07-minute disco disc version of ""Wait Here"" would have put it over half an hour. None of the originals are quite up to ""Belle"" or ""I Feel Good,"" but every song is solid, and two audacious covers of songs heretofore recorded exclusively by women are his best in five years. The intensity of the 2:12-minute ""I Say a Little Prayer"" (dig that male chorus) is precious in a time of dance-length cuts, and although I know Green devotes ""To Sir With Love"" to his dad, I'm glad Proposition 6 was defeated before its release.

FALSE,B+,The Lord Will Make a Way,Al Green,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4894,"
Think of it this way: he knew that sex was running out of inspiration for him, so he moved on to God as his source of ecstasy--an ecstasy he approaches most readily in what he really lives for, music. I might end up praising God myself if He or She gave me the most beautiful voice in creation and then let me keep it when I descended into purgatory. As it is, I'll praise Al for his lead guitar, which lends such a down-by-the-riverside feel to these rolling gospel tunes that you hardly notice the violins.
"
FALSE,B+,Tokyo . . . Live!,Al Green,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=71,"
You can tell when Green is bad live because he doesn't sing, often deserting mike or even stage for emphasis, which would be hard to render on disc. So his in-concert double had to be pretty strong. Like Otis's Live in Europe, it captures a sensitive soul man at his toughest and most outgoing. But unlike Live in Europe it offers no ecstatic epiphanies to make up for the forced crescendos--""I Feel Good"" is louder in this version but wilder on The Belle Album. And speaking of loud, somebody fucked up the drum mix.

FALSE,B+,He Is the Light,Al Green,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=73,"
It's not that Al's reunion with Willie Mitchell makes no difference--the difference is fairly striking when you listen for it. What's striking when you think about it, though, is that you have to listen for it. Leroy Hodges's famous bottom keeps the record flowing like none of Green's other Jesus LPs, but it's still songs that make or break--and in this case do neither.

FALSE,B+,I Get Joy,Al Green,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=75,"
By now he's B.B. King or Ray Charles--his genre exercises are more joyful than lesser mortals' great leaps forward. Only Al is more consistent, and he shares his genre with Amy Grant: pop songs addressed to God. What distinguishes this exercise is unflinching formal exposition--no Supremes or James Taylor ringers. Even the electrofunk belongs.

FALSE,B+,Your Heart's in Good Hands,Al Green,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=80,"
MCA is docked a notch for updating Don't Look Back by hiring Queen of Banality Diane Warren to write a new lead track, and then having Little King of Funk Lite Narada Michael Walden produce it. Jodeci's DeVante provides the other new one, and although Al schmears his mythic high range all over both, their timid low range sounds like nothing more than a suave market ploy up against the emulated Hi Rhythm and borrowed Young Cannibals propelling everything that follows.

FALSE,B+,Why Don't You Do Right? 1940-1942,Lil Green,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16058,"
Even more than Bessie Smith, this later as well as lesser blues singer--born 1919, recorded mostly pre-WW2, pursued sketchily documented r&amp;b touring career until she died of pneumonia at 34--suffers from formulaic recording, and fortunate though she is that her formula included Bill Broonzy on guitar, she lacked melodic outreach even though she preferred pop structures to ye olde aab. Her signature is a sexuality that's sly and lascivious rather than hearty and lusty, put across by a willowy soprano that's ready for anything. Often anything means just what men hope it does, those dogs. But it can also mean patient affection and, if ""Just Rockin'"" says what I think it does, a thrilling night of self-gratification should her dog be out chasing pussy. If there's an ace compilation hidden in her catalogue, no one's talking, but this equally downloadable old French job beats the recent Lil's Big Hits (on K-Tel, I swear)--even improves on 1971's Romance in the Dark, assembled by the discerning Don Schlitten for RCA. By my count, about half its 23 tracks distinguish themselves as songs. The rest distinguish themselves as style only.

FALSE,B+,In the Skies,Peter Green,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2737,"
For a supposed resident of Cloud-Cuckoo Land, Fleetwood Mac's original hitmaker is doing all right--this solo comeback is a lot solider than number three from Bob Welch (featuring ""Future Games"" as blast from the past), number two from Danny Kirwan (blonde on the cover), or number one from Jeremy Spencer (now apparently unborn-again, though six out of seven songs pivot on the word ""love"" and the eternal one is graced with syndrums). Green's new music goes back even before Then Play On, but it's a lot more confident--simple guitar excursions with a Latin lilt, like Carlos Santana with a sense of form (or limits).

FALSE,B+,Petaluma,Norman Greenbaum,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6948,"
In 1966, practicing as Dr. West, he hit with ""The Eggplant That Ate Chicago."" In 1969, his jug-rock album Spirit in the Sky fermented until it produced the 1970 AM longshot of the same name. So take last year's bland Back Home Again as premature product and enjoy this right-on-schedule one-of-a-kind all-acoustic project--a record about living in the country rather than escaping to it by a man who's taking his ""royalties/And puttin them into this goat dairy."" That's from ""Grade A Barn,"" but rest assured that this is a singer-songwriter whose knowledge of pastorale transcends the technical--as in ""I'm Campin,"" about how goat farmers get nature, and ""Dairy Queen,"" about a baton-twirling miss who longs to get the hell away from Petaluma.

FALSE,B+,Gravity Talks,Green on Red,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1456,"
Static on stage, its records diverting but ephemeral, L.A. neopsychedelica is yet another nostalgic, romantic, ""commercial"" extension of/reaction to an uncompromising rock and roll vanguard; it bears the same relation to slam-pit hard core as New York neopop did to CBGB punk. Since psychedelica was fairly silly even in the '60s, I'm agin it, at least in theory. I must admit, though, that the dumb tunes on this album not only stick with me but grow on me, in their gauche way. Just wish I knew whether I was laughing with them or at them. And when the verse about the dead dad follows the verse about the dead dog, I suspect the worst.

Dan Stuart's not so much an acquired taste as an arbitrary one--though I find his phony drawl kind of cute, I understand those who find it kind of hopeless better than those who consider it the essence of populist substance abuse. But his booze roots aren't ready for the mulch pile quite yet, and after too many plays I was surprised to conclude that his second Americana move was far catchier and more good-humored than number one. If you think it's hopeless, though, I won't argue.

Just when you thought he'd wandered off into dipsomania, Dan Stuart reemerges on Jim Dickinson's shoulder as Neil Young and Mick Jagger fried into one bar singer. With Chuck Prophet playing the blues and Dan wailing about careless what-have-you, this is the Crazy Horse album Neil hasn't had the jam to toss off since Somoza.

FALSE,B+,Little Love Affairs,Nanci Griffith,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2502,"
For Griffith, the notion that the past was better than the present isn't just a bias, it's a worldview--consider ""I Knew Love"" (""when it was more than just a word"") or ""Love Wore a Halo Back Before the War"" (WWII, she means). And with Tony Brown pushing her ever more firmly toward such marketable cliches as the raunchy growl and the pedal-steel whine, she's one neotraditionalist with a future. If you can forgive ""I Knew Love""'s purism, first side doesn't quit--the regrets of ""Anybody Can Be Somebody's Fool"" and ""So Long Ago"" are as permanent as they come. Second side's got John Stewart as Waylon Jennings and real country songs by the auteur.

There's nothing progressive and plenty idiosyncratic about Griffiths's quest for naturality, which is fine--in reggae, idiosyncrasy makes all the marginal difference.

More than any other rootsman I'm hearing, Griffiths keeps his spirits up. Though it's no longer in JA's cultural mainstream, there's tremendous life and variety to this music--falsetto play and jazzy interactions and catchy dubs, even an Elvis cover. ""It's Now or Never,"" in case you were wondering. And if you're still interested, it may just be definitive.

Initially, I took this jazzy Western bluegrass concoction for an acoustic variant on one of those session superstar instrumental LPs. But where it's the tendency of a band like the Section, for instance, to sound self-satisfied, as if getting stuck that deep in a groove were a spiritual achievement, this music is always sprightly, inquisitive, and surprising. Lightweight stuff, you say--I say it's airy.

What do people gain by resisting all this popcraft? Is AM acceptance so tainted that these proven riffs and melodies shrivel the soul on contact? Or does the way Burton Cummings shifts from rock to swing or croon to growl without any show of strain or even technique just make him ""slick,"" as they say? Granted, when I hear all the singles together like this I notice that since the romantic loss recorded in ""These Eyes"" Cummings has become unnecessarily spiteful. But songs that put down women and people who work for a living have never bothered AM haters before.

In which the Frenchman who inflicted the Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling"" on a hapless America--brute! vulgarian! snailsucker! 'ho!--bids for chart success as if he needs to be more famous than he already is. All power synths and squirmy earworms, dated beats and neutered Snoop Dogg, it offends club sophisticates no less than living-room discophobes. But with four-on-the-floor dance music the nearest the actually popular pop world came to mindless rocking out in 2011, I only wish it had a few ""I Gotta Feeling""s. Still, the two Nicki Minaj features come close, Taio Cruz does what he's sposed to for once, the will.i.am preachment makes its escapist statement, and neutering Snoop is fine with both me and the ASPCA. Front-loaded in this 13-track Americanski version--as a reward for their sophistication, the Europeans get to fatten up on excess instrumentals--it should slim down further by ditching the last two tracks and climaxing with the Jennifer Hudson love anthem ""Night of Your Life,"" where it simulates the soul that elsewhere is so beside the point.

Hopeless eccentric spends most of his adult life and a large chunk of his ill-gotten fortune trying to make the perfect album. Succeeds, kind of, on his own totally irrelevant terms. Nobody cares. Since he's no longer capable of leading young white males astray, this effort isn't just pleasurable artistically. It's touching on a human level. Noble, even. I didn't think he had it in him.

Produced by P������������������l Brennan of Clannad, the insufferable lace-curtain-Irish folkies who bequeathed Enya unto the world, and with Guo Yue's Chinese flute and Guo Yi's Chinese mouth organ carrying the melodies and Guo Liang's plucked Chinese harp plenty prominent, the instrumental affinities are self-evident. So I worry about the spiritual affinities. My working theory is that Maoist aesthetics knows the difference between dignity and gentility, enabling these exiles to formalize folk music into art music without draining its life away. Of course, this could be utter fancy--just as likely some arbitrary synthesis of acculturation and deep bodily need inclines me toward Chinese scales.

If somebody's gotta make exploring-the-folkie-mind-set records, oh Lord let it be somebody with a strong sense of history as well as a weakness for nostalgia. ""Ukelele Lady"" sounds positively intelligent backing one of Woody's heaviest antiscab ballads, and if the new ones about trains and booze seem slightly outmoded, well, that's part of the point, right?
"
FALSE,B+,Arlo Guthrie,Arlo Guthrie,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6960,"
This odd little record comes on like Arlo VII, which might rightfully excite semi-coma among the unconverted, but it's not. For once, Lenny Waronker's expertise produces music--playing and especially singing, not aural quality--that flirts (a little coyly) with amateurishness. Plus the record is political in a consciously oblique and sometimes fuzzy smart-hippie way. Arlo's Watergate song does justice to Tom T. Hall. And the two spirituals that make you wonder why he's fooling around with the Southern California Community Choir turn out to be about Israel.

With or without Junior Wells, Guy hasn't put so much guitar on an album since A Man and the Blues in 1967, and if anything this is wilder and more jagged. Which is great if you like your blues straight, without Otis Spann stitching a groove. I prefer mine on the rock.

I assume this 1974 live-at-Montreux was finally released because it features Bill Wyman, who does seem to know the parts, but saints be praised, he's not the star. Saints be criticized, neither is Wells, who was once a sharper, tighter singer. He's plenty soulful, though, especially on harp, and Guy picks up the slack--listen to him think on ""Ten Years Ago.""

FALSE,B+,Pro Tools,GZA/Genius,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14269,"
Never thought I'd say this, but RZA isn't missed--the budget production enhances a master lyricist's specialty by subtraction. After dispensing with the ""horrific torture by prolific authors"" upsmanship, he's both factual, as on the doomed ""Short Race"" and ""Path of Destruction,"" and fanciful, as on ""0% Finance""'s renovated terraplane and ""Cinema""'s scary movie. RZA re-enters rapping on the farewell ""Life Is a Movie,"" in which a wild script takes off from humble facts but runs into trouble in production.

In the studio, trumpeter Tim Hagans's integration of turntables and samples into jazz combo ended up subtly and fatally stiff and segmented.

An album of Bob Wills songs, featuring genuine Wills sidemen with Johnny Gimble (as well as Haggard himself) on fiddle? Now that's the Merle I trust. His uncountrypolitan formal sense has always gone along with a reverence for history, and his subtle, surprisingly tranquil, yet passionate singing style--all that yodel and straining head voice--was made for Wills's pop-jazz-country amalgam.

An honest two days' work, but don't let the keynote tune fool you into expecting a lot of class-conscious reminiscences. ""California Cottonfields"" and ""Tulare Dust"" are welcome, but this has its share of romantic pap, and the nostalgia of the title bubbles too close to the surface.

I object in principle to music-with-commentary albums, and Haggard is hardly as forthcoming with his ""inner thoughts"" as the notes promise. But despite its mawkish moments--especially Tommy Collins's dead-mommy song--the material defines Haggard's sensibility in a winning way, and since not one of the songs is great in itself I guess the commentary must do it. For controversy, there's interracial love.

Also: ""Every Fool Has a String Section,"" I mean ""Rainbow,"" and ""No Reason to Quit,"" where his timbre, which has been softening perceptibly over the years, breaks definitively into self-pity.

The man has been making them for less than a decade, and thirty is too damn many. But this is clearly where Haggard wants to show off his range, and the display, featuring more original songs than he's put in one place for a long time, is pretty impressive. There's a rip-roaring infidelity lyric that's definitely one of his genius pieces--""Old Man From the Mountain,"" it's called, complete with bluegrass shading. And though after that only ""Honky Tonk Nighttime Man"" and the Bob Wills/Lefty Frizzell cover are liable to be remembered, just about everything else is liable to be enjoyed.

FALSE,B+,Serving 190 Proof,Merle Haggard,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2353,"
Its impeccable simplicity and sensitivity gives Haggard's fourth and best album for MCA an autumnal feel reminiscent of recent comebacks by Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. Granted, autumnal country music is easier to come by than autumnal rock and roll. But for Haggard, a mere forty-one but feeling it, the effect has thematic repercussions--and he's written a batch of wise songs to flesh it out.

""Wake Up,"" a devastating final-night plea that's one of Haggard's few great love songs, is the only original that transcends his usual poses, with ""Sky-Bo""--""That's a new kind of hobo for planes""--the most cloying offender. But Haggard's chief value has been vocal ever since ""Okie From Muskogee"" saddled him with an image, and here his resonant, reflective baritone transforms three Ernest Tubb tunes from standards into timeless pieces of Americana. If Willie Nelson is Bing Crosby, Haggard's Sinatra.

Though occasional jingoisms like last year's Amber Waves of Grain encourage citified ignoramuses to believe he can't see beyond Muskogee, over the years his musical sophistication has surpassed even Willie Nelson's. His Strangers are a stripped-down version of Bob Wills's Playboys, his soft timbre and lazy swing marks of a singer who'll never get old, and unlike Nelson he keeps writing. This compilation is overdue--he deserted the label in '81--and not all it should be. It draws too heavily on the all too conceptual 1980 Back to the Barrooms. Its two best songs may steer you away from the minor pleasures of the all-encompassingly unconceptual The Way I Am. And it's recommended to ignoramuses nevertheless.

Just when I decide he's gonna lay back forever he ambles into this. No Nippophobia, minimal love pap, a touch of Mexico, and lots of swing--except for one Freddy Powers pledge it keeps going till the obligatory sentimentality of the last two cuts.

Although Haggard recorded many more good albums in the '00s than in the '90s, his songwriting hasn't been this sharp since 2000's If I Could Only Fly. Not that every song flies, and not that he creaks so noticeably on the December-December ""We're Falling in Love Again"" just to make sure he conveys how ""making love 'neath the stars"" actually feels at 73. But his good-old-days laments taste sweet where once they curdled. You'd almost think he's grateful to be alive, which may just be why Johnny Cash's ghost gets to croak ""I watched it all completely fall apart"" on the lead track.

Haggard hasn't sung with so much care in years, which is obviously Nelson's doing--the difference between this ""Half a Man"" and the one on Going Where the Lonely Go is the difference between a husband who doesn't deserve to be cut down and a shit who does. But if Waylon brings out Willie's self-righteousness, Merle brings out his self-pity--Leona Williams doesn't want you to know it, but both of these boys have had more soft places to fall than any good man needs.

What was still authentic cacophony last time has evolved inexorably into avant-gardism, its jazz/r&amp;b elements articulated by ever classier sidemen. All 22 cuts are entertaining at least, and the musicianship adds listenability, which has its uses even with a singer who models himself on a wise-ass nine-year-old--""Silver and Katherine"" is almost ""beautiful."" But the crude, breakneck, sui generis primitivism has slipped away somehow, and for all his protean whatsis (he's definitely a maturing nine-year-old, a contradiction I come to praise not to bury), Jad Fair is less himself without it. As of now, anyway.

FALSE,B+,Charmed Life,Half Japanese,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1483,"
How can you not love a band who label the cassette version: ""Added Bonus!--10 Extra Songs Not Found on the LP""? Even if four of them are alternate takes and two or three others concern wrestling. Even if ""Madonna Nude"" (its coda a wrestling-style challenge to Sean Penn) really belongs on a 21-song vinyl version devoted to the love fantasies of a geek with glasses.

FALSE,B+,No Goodbyes,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6978,"
The three previously unreleased songs on this compilation--especially ""Love You Like a Brother,"" an ironic double or triple whammy--define worldly, media-saturated, serially monogamous singles (as in singles bar, though I'm sure they wouldn't stoop so low) as well as the best cuts on the well-represented Abandoned Luncheonette. The three songs from War Babies take on larger issues of concern to singles--destruction by stardom, etc.
"
FALSE,B+,Rock'n Soul Part 1,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4926,"
This best-of is where to get to know them, but I wouldn't sit around waiting for that marriage proposal if I were you. There's no denying the instant pleasure of such slick tricks as the seductive ""One on One,"" the bitchy ""Rich Girl,"" the inevitable ""She's Gone,"" and for that matter the sexist ""Manheater."" But in this pop era, instant pleasure never carries a lifetime guarantee.
"
FALSE,B+,I Witness Life,Tom T. Hall,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3983,"
I'm a fan of this Nashville original's most famous song, ""Harper Valley P.T.A.,"" because like all his best work it combines pithy narrative with pithy ethics. Its flaw is that its truth is metaphorical--it sounds made up. The two greatest songs here--""Salute to a Switchblade"" and ""The Ballad of Bill Crump,"" one an autobiographical tale of barroom violence (and discretion) abroad, the other a biographical tale about the death of a carpenter--are documentaries in rhyme. The method isn't original, foolproof, or the only one in his kit. But boy, is he good at it.
"
FALSE,B+,Faster Horses,Tom T. Hall,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3987,"
The first decent record by my former favorite country singer-songwriter in over three years. High point: ""Big Motel on the Mountain."" Rock stars are forever reviling motels, their readymade symbol of the impersonal rootlessness of life on the road; Hall obviously tore himself away from the soaps and game shows one day and deduced that the premises supported a life of their own. You think that says anything about the relationship between perceived impersonality and egocentricity? I do.
"
FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits--Volume III,Tom T. Hall,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6976,"
In which Hall goes to work for RCA and Mercury mops together some final product. Three of the four great songs--""I Can't Dance,"" ""She Gave Her Heart to Jethro,"" and the mind-boggling ""Turn It On, Turn It On, Turn It On,"" about the electrocution of a mass-murdering 4-F in 1944--date from 1972 or before, when it seemed he'd never run out of stories.
"
FALSE,B+,Everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels,Tom T. Hall,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4929,"
Returning from five misspent years at RCA, with his 1982 Earl Scruggs collaboration for CBS a halfway house, Hall delivers his strongest album in a decade and bitterest ever, chock full of death, decrepitude, and disillusion. In fact, T. sounds so down on himself you'd think he was an aging rock star--real truth-sayers rarely get this cynical. ""The Adventures of Linda Bohannon,"" the only yarn in his classic mold, is also the only song here to end with his patented shrug-and-chuckle. Life does go on, just like he's always said, and now that he's decided to give honest music another try he should get out and talk to folks again.
"
FALSE,B+,Choochtown,Hamell on Trial,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1492,"
Ed Hamell is a DIY folkie with a punky band who inhabits the sleazy corner where boonie bohemia meets pure low-life. Drugs can make that happen, as can marginal employment slipping toward petty crime. His pals Chooch and Joe Brush certainly don't read Hammett, maybe Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen for the warm weather. I bet Hamell reads them all--and that along with talk TV, they've influenced his narrative poesy.
"
FALSE,B+,Future Shock,Herbie Hancock,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4931,"
As a guy who likes his funk obvious, I think those who esteem ""Rockit"" as highly as Head Hunters are too kind to Head Hunters. Small thanks to Herbie, lots to Material and Grand Mixer D.St., it's the best novelty instrumental in years and the best pop of Hancock's life. Elsewhere various bright ideas, such as Pete Cosey, are obscured by the usual aura of set-piece dink--jumpy enough and often fun, but fusoid nevertheless.
"
FALSE,B+,White People,Handsome Boy Modeling School,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12565,"
Not the better class of white people, I'm afraid, although Paul and Dan manage to ground lounge-and-proud Chan Marshall, Julee Cruise, and Jamie Cullen more firmly than usual after feckless rocker Mike Patton gets away from them. Instead, what carries the album is, I swear, the skits--Guido Sarducci and Tim Meadows turn out to be as replayable as Posdnuos and Trugoy. Suitably, the very best of these, Meadows's ""Knockers"" (""Oh, wait one second, my illegitimate son is here""), climaxes the multipartite tour de force ""Rock and Roll (Could Never Hip Hop Like This) Part 2,"" the sole occasion when the perfectly interesting rock tracks hip hop enough. The hip hop, fortunately, hip hops plenty.
"
FALSE,B+,Hannibal,Hannibal,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11299,"
In jazz I've always been a saxophone man; I find trumpets too clean, so that even when Miles Davis is presiding I long for some breath of raunch to scent the proceedings. But this record, led by Hannibal Marvin Peterson over piano, cello, bass, and percussion, caught my ear immediately with its post-Coltrane strength and swing. I dissent as usual from the poem with percussion (about Africa, of course), but regard it as an appropriate price to pay for this fierce, coherent, auspicious trumpet music.
"
FALSE,B+,"Don't Follow Me, I'm Lost Too",Pearl Harbour,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4934,"
The rockabilly that Clash/Dury factotum Mickey Gallagher gets out of Pearl's anonymous sidepeople is crude and often a little leaden. But beyond the rare genius singer (Elvis, Jerry Lee) or player (Charlie Burton, Jerry Lee), rockabilly was always more attitude than fillip anyway, and for all their slap-bass oomph and sly guitar modernisms, I think the main reason the oft-praised Stray Cats like the style is that it lets them cover the borderline-racist ""Ubangi Stomp."" It's a little different when this half-Filipino woman--that's g-u-r-l, boys--resurrects ""Filipino Baby"" and ""Fujiyama Mama"" and then adds her own songs about sex manuals, fear of dentists, and ""Everybody's Boring but My Baby."" I mean, I do believe that's a punk chip on her shoulder, which in 1981 is the kind of wood I want to knock on.
"
FALSE,B+,Bleak Beauty,Clay Harper,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17369,"
In a counterpart to Mount Eerie's A Crow Looked at Me, where solitary guitarist Phil Elverum processed the shocking loss of his wife Genevieve to pancreatic cancer, Harper honors the passing of his longtime partner Stephanie Gwinn, who succumbed even faster to a brain tumor. But where Elverum's miserable minimalism grabs and haunts you, the mediated art blues of a shifting ensemble of Harper's pals is less devastated and less literal, though it never quite compels the total attention it repays. Lyric worth absorbing: ""Tells me what to think and objects to what I say / I don't know why / But I like it that way."" And how about: ""It's me again / I'll hold your hand / I'll be your man forever / But you sigh and then / Squeeze my hand / Say what if I don't get better""?
"
FALSE,B+,Profile: The Best of Emmylou Harris,Emmylou Harris,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1175,"
Lucky for Emmylou I don't know as much about country music as she does--the Louvin Brothers' ""If I Could Only Win Your Love"" and the Carter Family's ""Hello Stranger"" may well render her versions forgettable. But as it is, hers sure are pretty, like almost everything here, sung with undeniable care and charm. She also defines Dolly Parton's previously unrecorded ""To Daddy,"" as great a song as that great songwriter has ever come up with. And does all right by Chuck Berry.
"
FALSE,B+,"Def, Dumb and Blonde",Deborah Harry,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=992,"
Though she only approaches the daffy, wryly detached tone of past glories on maybe four songs (including a couple by the Thompson Twins), she's got the right idea and some nice touches--little recitatives, unassuming rap and house, Ian Astbury chiming in like Fred Schneider on Chris's occult number. The opener eagerly awaits the 21st century: ""I'll keep the money/You can have the fame""; the closer goes on elegiacally about the pastness of past glories: ""I knew it then/It won't be back again."" And in the end she's worth the trip if you can go CD, thus securing a lyric sheet and four add-ons, three of them punky.
"
FALSE,B+,Aereo-Plain,John Hartford,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1768,"
Insensitive though I am to tales of them thar pickers, I must admit that Norman Blake's guitar, Tut Taylor's dobro, and Vassar Clements's fiddle complement Hartford with tact, wit, and sly razzmatazz. But I insist that it's Hartford's funny, quirkish songs, rather than his banjo, that save me from continued boorishness. And warn that the songs are so grass-meets-bluegrass that remembering them sometimes gives me whimsy megrims and nostalgia headaches.
"
FALSE,B+,4-Track Demos,PJ Harvey,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2781,"
All right, so this isn't a cult artist's first ripoff. The new songs assure that. ""Easy,"" ""M-Bike,"" ""Hardly Wait,"" and especially the fleshpotted ""Reeling""--where ""Robert De Niro sit on my face"" leaves no doubt about whose blow-job queen she wants to be--share the kind of eager emotionality that makes Steve Albini cringe, and the same looseness animates this ""Yuri-G."" But I don't know how anyone can compare Rid of Me's ""Rid of Me"" without succumbing to its marshalled power, or concluding that with some forethought she could find even more juice in her sexual enthusiasm. She is a performer, after all.
"
FALSE,B+,Let England Shake,PJ Harvey,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15395,"
Polly Jean Harvey was major when she meant to shake the world, a life project she gave up on after releasing her finest album in 2000--much of it set, as must be mere coincidence, in New York City. Creating a suite of well-turned if unnecessarily understated antiwar songs, she's a gifted, strong-willed minor artist bent on shaking England in particular. How much that work enriches anyone's understanding of World War I is open to a debate too niggling to pursue. What's certain is that her special interest in the Great War reflects the changing contours of her chosen chauvinism no less than her evolution from the rough-hewn Howlin Wolf she absorbed in downhome Dorsetshire toward the dulcet clarity of Lancashire's prog-folk Annie Haslam. ""I live and die/through England/I live and die/through England""? You said it, lady--twice.
"
FALSE,B+,Deseos,Mariem Hassan,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13935,"
This strong Saharaui woman is one more singing cynosure whose solo debut proves she needed her band. Without the backing of Leyoad and especially the male counterpoint of Jalihena, she permits herself unaccompanied meditations where she has trouble maintaining the same intensity of concentration, ours and possibly hers. Hassan remains a voice to be heard. But if you start drifting away, cue up the groove tracks ""El Chouhada"" and ""Kalat Leili.""
"
FALSE,B+,Baila Sahara Baila,Mariem Hassan & Vadiya Mint El Hanevi,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17021,"
Right, Spanish speakers, it's a Saharan dance album where Hassan's indomitable voice is augmented by percussionist-dancer Hanevi's chirpier one. Tempos vary perceptibly, rhythms decisively, yet although the results are galvanic, they'll wear down anyone who hasn't internalized those rhythms. So although Lamgaifri Brahim is the guitar virtuoso here, I find myself equally drawn to the downtempo Nayim Alal instrumental ""Bleida."" A one-of-a-kind document most pleasurably consumed in controlled portions.
"
FALSE,B+,Aka/Darbari/Java,Jon Hassell,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1772,"
With much help from Senegalese drummer Abdou Mboup, Hassell fabricates ambient groove music. The rhythms lull rather than motivate, their goal contemplation rather than unconsciousness. On Fourth World Vol. 1, the goal was more like transcendence.
"
FALSE,B+,The Surgeon of the Nightsky Restores Dead Things by the Power of Sound,Jon Hassell,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1774,"
Minimalist trumpeter discovers keyboard textures while abandoning quasi-traditionalist surface, just like Miles Davis before him. But though it's also true that both men have done their schlockiest work while tickling the microchips, Hassell's impulses are so esoteric that a little schlock becomes them. I doubt he'll ever equal his first Eno project, and Power Spot is tougher. But if you're looking for ambient music that eschews new age sweetener, this'll calm your nerves real nice.
"
FALSE,B+,Suffer No More: The Ted Hawkins Story,Ted Hawkins,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3429,"
Maybe the radical alarm and homely detail of ""Sorry You're Sick"" are less unguarded than they seem--this guy made his living disarming passersby. Even so, Hawkins's two Rounder releases achieve an aesthetic of the natural--songs about combs, about doing the dishes, about vagrant desire. The U.K.-only late-'80s selections are pedestrian by comparison--beautifully sung, but incompletely imagined and indifferently arranged. Because compiler Gary Stewart thinks like a collector and adores Hawkins, a summing-up that might have established an American original is only a misleading introduction--to an American original.
"
FALSE,B+,"Quark, Strangeness and Charm",Hawkwind,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1507,"
In the old days, this likable British band played more benefits than Joan Baez and helped give psychedelic rock its bad name--when you repeat three chords in 4/4 for forty-five minutes, it's politic to change riffs once in a while. Yet they're still around, and good for them. Here they manage to spread six songs over eight cuts--a trick accomplished by granting two rather ponderous jams names and numbers of their own--as well as introducing more substantial innovations: for every song there's a good new riff, and by now the old sci-fi/counterculture themes mean something, probably because lyricist Robert Calvert has gained wit and wisdom since the time of zonk. Irresistible: the title cut, which suggests that Einstein had trouble with girls because he didn't dig subatomic physics.
"
FALSE,B+,Bebe Le Strange,Heart,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4944,"
So Nancy Wilson breaks up with her fella, soundman Mike Fisher, who naturally departs the band, along with his brother Roger, who happens to be the guitarist. And whether it's the absence of pomp-rockish Roger, stripping to a five-piece, or what hell hath no fury like, suddenly they're lean and mean and playing to the sisters--title cut's a fan letter to the female Johnny B. Goode, who I guess is Nancy, now playing a lot of lead. Take note, fellas--as Zep rips go, this one is something special, and not just for its sexual politics. Unfortunately, things go gushy at the end with an Ann-penned love song. Men--who needs 'em?
"
FALSE,B+,Heaven 17,Heaven 17,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4947,"
As communiques--in Britain, where this group speaks directly to a general youth public--these cool-to-gnomic commentaries on a modernity in which jobs aren't roles, dreams aren't ideals, and the personal isn't quite the political undoubtedly earn some anthemic aura. As artifacts--in the U.S., where this group is sometimes confused with Duran Duran--they're dance music, albeit with generally thought-provoking hooks.
"
FALSE,B+,The Luxury Gap,Heaven 17,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1509,"
Although their second U.S. album lacks the surface appeal of the debut compilation, it runs deeper, and politics makes the difference--not because their conscience impels them to come up with likable protest novelties like ""Fascist Groove Thing"" and ""Let's All Make a Bomb,"" but because their compassion induces them to explore a subject to which they have privileged access. Nowhere else in music or sociology will you learn so much about the would-be hedonists who live the technopop/Anglodisco life. Obsessed with an upward mobility that fails to produce the advertised highs, their protagonists suffer the weariness known only to those who habitually overtax their wills. And Glen Gregory's cultivated, well-meaning vocals combine concerned observation with hard experience just soulfully enough.

FALSE,B+,"Too Dumb for Suicide: Tim Heidecker's Trump
Songs",Tim Heidecker,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17206,"
Satire is too good for this potbellied pigwad, this flab-dicked jism drizzler, this ADD SOB, this pustule in a truss, this snake oil salesman in a cancer ward, this, I don't know, real estate man. Loathing is all he deserves, and loathing is hard to put into words, so that even a rhetorician as committed as comedian and challenged singer Heidecker has trouble finding language beyond the magnificent ""Imperial Bathroom,"" a detailed description of *****'s black, rocklike, KFC-informed feces that's keyed to the useful catchphrase ""Trump dump"" and culminates by predicting he'll die on the porcelain throne. But to be fair, ""Wilbur Ross"" and ""Cooked Chinese Chicken"" do pack bite if not bile, as does Heidecker's account of his own brave death in the dungeons of Trump Tower. And ""Sentencing Day""'s fantasy of ***** shitting in a pail and/or hanging in the sun is kinda sweet. But where's last spring's Father John Misty collab ""I Am a Cuck,"" a sharper song by far than ""Trump's Private Pilot,"" which gets a Misty remake for musical cred here? Face it, Tim--*****'s pilot is licensed to kiss ass. Motherfucker attracts toadies like a sump full of lily pads.

FALSE,B+,R.I.P.,Richard Hell,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4949,"
Supposedly the farewell of annotator Lester Meyers to his alter ego Hell, this fourteen-song all-previously-unreleased compilation begins with Johnny Thunders in New York, ends with Ziggy Modeliste in New Orleans, and preserves seven new songs and eight new Robert Quine cuts. What could be bad? you ask perspicaciously, and yet I'm a little disappointed. Only Fats Domino's ""I Live My Life"" and a painful lament for a masochist groupie called ""Hurt Me"" would improve Blank Generation or even Destiny Street, and the alternate versions alter nothing. Recommended to Walkpeople.
"
FALSE,B+,Band of Gypsys,Jimi Hendrix,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1691,"
Because Billy Cox and Buddy Miles are committed (not to say limited) to a straight 4/4 with a slight funk bump, Hendrix has never sounded more earthbound. ""Who Knows,"" based on a blues elemental, and ""Machine Gun,"" a peacemonger's long-overdue declaration of war, are as powerful if not as complex as anything he's ever put on record. But except on the rapid-fire ""Message to Love"" he just plays simple wah-wah patterns for a lot of side two. Not bad for a live rock album, because Hendrix is the music's nonpareil improvisor. But for a Hendrix album, not great.
"
FALSE,B+,Crash Landing,Jimi Hendrix,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7001,"
The studio guys producer-curator Alan Douglas assigned to provide proper tracks (he claims the originals were unreleasable, though one must wonder whether he could have grabbed all that composition credit if he'd put 'em out untouched) do a surprisingly competent job. In fact, I don't even blame them for the competent lifelessness of side one--Jimi was a pretty fair city songwriter (cf. such guitar whizzes as Clapton, Garcia, Page, Trower, Marino, Beck), but his legacy can't be infinite. Side two, however, includes the best hook here--a soul consciousness chant called ""With the Power"" that features Buddy Miles and Billy Cox--as well as two astonishing instrumental showpieces, ""Peace in Mississippi"" (feedback heaven) and ""Captain Coconut"" (studio space).
"
FALSE,B+,Midnight Lightning,Jimi Hendrix,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7002,"
With posthumous Hendrix it's best to concentrate on the improvisations as if he were a jazz musician, and heard this way Alan Douglas's second attempt at creative tampering beats the first. Once again the standouts are instrumentals--a Mitch Mitchell vamp called ""Beginnings"" and especially ""Trash Man,"" reminiscent of McLaughlin's Devotion only grander, more passionate, and more anarchic. Guitarist Jeff Mironov actually enriches that cut, just as guitarist Lance Quinn does ""Machine Gun,"" which due to the stiffness of the rhythm section is less funky than either live version but smashes through as a raveup. And beyond that the blues playing--as opposed to singing or writing--carries the album.
"
FALSE,B+,Nine to the Universe,Jimi Hendrix,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4950,"
With posthumous Hendrix it's always best to concentrate on the improvisations as if he were a jazz musician, and these relaxed jams are his jazziest contexts to date. Unfortunately, at least in theory, the only jazz player on hand is organist Larry Young, who got pretty far out with Miles and McLaughlin but sounds like Jimmy Smith over the Billy Cox-Mitch Mitchell beat. The result is bracing progressive r&amp;b with Jimi stretching out, and the question is whether tighter structures wouldn't have made him think harder and faster.
"
FALSE,B+,The Jimi Hendrix Concerts,Jimi Hendrix,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4951,"
Limited by Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell, never the world's greatest living rhythm section, this barrel-bottom houses Hendrix the heavy metal paterfamilias rather than Hendrix the nonpareil rock improviser (not that the two weren't sometimes the same). There've been more exciting versions of such highlights as ""Hear My Train a Comin'"" (on Rainbow Bridge), ""Little Wing,"" and especially ""Red House"" (both on the criminally deleted Hendrix in the West). But ""Are You Experienced"" has never been noisier.
"
FALSE,B+,Jimi at Monterey,Jimi Hendrix,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4952,"
Since I've oft been chastised for suggesting that the JHE's U.S. splashdown was less than extraterrestrial, I'm surprised at the yes-we-have-no-hosannas greeting this verbatim version. Maybe it's because only three of the ten tracks are previously unreleased. Maybe it's because after years of repackaging only suckers and acolytes get hot for another live Hendrix album. Or maybe it's because Jimi speeds alarmingly, Mitch Mitchell keeps tripping over his sticks, and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is patently hokey. Nevertheless, such extramusical factors as historical verisimilitude and tinless audio incline me to charity. Peace-and-love-and-egomania at its most far out.
"
FALSE,B+,BBC Sessions,Jimi Hendrix,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1699,"
An essential exhumation of the only rock artist I'm convinced merits them (I'll finish with the Springsteen box soon, honest). But despite the one-minute ""Sunshine of My Love"" and other oddments from his mercurial top-of-the-pops career, anyone who owns Rykodisc's one-CD 1988 version, off the market now that the good guys control the catalogue, has the essentials. There's a whiff of completism coming off the definitive Hendrix reissue program--the usual mix of profit maximization and hero worship, certain to separate the fans from the scholars pretty quick. The rationalization being, I guess, that six is nine--the fans are scholars already.

Charged with curbing Nona's insatiable desire to make rock records, Bill Laswell and Michael Beinhorn were abstemious enough not to make a Material record instead--just a slightly cerebral who-is-that-singing? funk record, with the cerebration mostly Nona's. As you might deduce, it could be smarter, but you can dance to it without losing your mind.

Makes sense that Henley's candid self-involvement should prove of more intrinsic interest than Glenn Frey's covert self-pity, but nobody capable of the distinction figured it would get as interesting as this. If there were anything to actually like about the guy, his complaints and revelations might even be moving. As it is, let's call them strong--like primo tequila, or the smell of an old jockstrap.

FALSE,B+,Somewhere on the Golden Coast,The Henry Clay People,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15401,"
Although their new EP sounds suspiciously like a reject pile, this talky 2010 tunefest showcases a six-years-running LA g-g-b-d who like Neil Young, Tom Petty, and especially the Replacements, the latter of whom they resemble but fall well short of matching, as goes without saying for the first two. Says chief songwriter Andy Siara: ""The situations I find myself are situations that a whole crapload of 20-somethings who don't know what they're doing are in as well."" Their gift is transforming these situations into songs that don't have quite the juice to inspire a movement, including songs with titles like ""Working Parttime"" and ""End of an Empire."" They named themselves after The Great Compromiser because they wanted something historical-political, adjudged the Forgotten Presidency of Chester A. Arthur too long for a marquee, and settled--too soon, as compromisers will. I think of them as the Displacements myself.

""We found some jobs and paid off our loans/Then we lost our jobs and let your parents know/That you'll be movin' home."" ""Every band we ever loved/Is selling out or breaking up/Finding out the limits of their reach."" ""Give it up and come on out/That stupid dream is over."" ""You are the property of privilege/Now you are learning how to live with it."" ""You wanna taste a taste of the tasteless/We can waste away with the wasted."" ""And I can move to the country/But that won't solve anything."" ""One mistake too many fights three nights/You pay for the rest of your life."" ""Friends are forgetting/We're getting too tired to try/Keeping up with each other/So we leave them behind."" ""Not that it ever made a difference/Back when we were innocent/Oh-oh-oh."" Pretty impressive. Problem? More than half the songs sound effectively the same. Rocking, absolutely. Tighter, too. Tuneful, in their way. But imagine the Replacements without Westerberg's hookfinder and you'll understand the limits of their reach.

This casually joyous solo debut by the former Greenbriar Boy gives in at times to such folky vices as mere flash, mere lyricism, and mere whimsy. But ""Fire Song,"" a casually joyous ditty about how his house burned down, and ""Brother Sam,"" unpresumptuous compassion for a returned Vietnam vet, should inspire Paul Simon to work real hard on the follow-up.

Maybe his transported singing honors George Jones and Jerry Lee Lewis along with Red Allen and Bill Monroe because his long experience in folkiedom taught him something new about authenticity. Or maybe it's just that he's not above sinning.
"
FALSE,B+,Slug Line,John Hiatt,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1778,"
This hard-working young pro may yet turn into an all-American Elvis C. He's focused his changeable voice up around the high end and straightened out his always impressive melodies, but he has a weakness for the shallow (if sincere) putdown, e.g.: ""You're too dumb to have a choice."" Or else he'd get chosen, do you think he means? Lene Lovich: should cover ""You're My Love Interest.""
"
FALSE,B+,Slow Turning,John Hiatt,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1784,"
Cut with his road band rather than a select cast of studio heavies, which probably took some pressure off a perpetual comer who turns the juice up too high when he gets nervous. Anyway, the high-grade country fodder--""Is Anybody There?"" to a woman who loves him, ""Georgia Rae"" to a newborn daughter, and so forth--goes down easier. And the mean stuff he's always been best at--a roving couple who shoot up an automatic teller for laundromat change, a roving couple who steal one of Elvis's Cadillacs, a guy who cheats the world just like his daddy did--has a properly rowdy edge.

FALSE,B+,Y'All Caught?: The Ones That Got Away 1979-1985,John Hiatt,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4960,"
""She Said the Same Things to Me"" and ""It Hasn't Happened Yet"" are winning answers to the wimmin question, and every time they come up I feel like I love this male chauvinist victim. But not so's I pull out Warming Up to the Ice Age or Two Bit Monsters. The rest of his greatest misses are catchy, clever, even compassionate when you listen hard. Three are from Riding With the King, which I did go find--and still prefer.
"
FALSE,B+,The Best of John Hiatt,John Hiatt,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1785,"
Master of a Nashville-Memphis fusion that is all of rock and roll to his own generation and totally cornball to the next, this Springsteen-writ-small has always yoked Grade A songwriting to Brand X singing, and by now it's clear the limitation is as much intellectual as physical. Almost every individual selection here connects, the wedding plea ""Have a Little Faith in Me"" no less than the bank-robbing saga ""Tennessee Plates."" But though one doesn't negate the other--life is long, and various--Hiatt's ever more skillful shows of soul can't make them cohere, because at bottom he has nothing to say. All things considered, he might have been better off with less voice, not more. Then he wouldn't have been tempted to juggle career options on that endless road. He'd have settled into the well-heeled life of a Music Row pro. Alan Jackson would record his songs.
"
FALSE,B+,Striking It Rich!,Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7010,"
This isn't as long on ambient whimsy as Where's the Money?, but that's OK--makes a less distracting showcase for an artist who's much better at writing songs than at contextualizing them. I count seven I'd be delighted to hear somebody cover, and it's fun to hear Hicks's own outfit go after them. Best contextualization: Maryann Price's interpretation of ""I'm an Old Cowhand.""
"
FALSE,B+,Crazy for Christmas,Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15543,"
Crazy because he's always been pleasantly nuts, but also because he's crazy not just as a result of but about Christmas, which as all Christmas fans know is a combination with a shot at making the holiday as full of good cheer as it's supposed to be. Scatting ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" as one retro strategy among many, Hicks lays out an ""Old Fashioned Christmas"" complete with ""Bethlehem scene on the lawn/And a picture of Rudolph in the john"" as the elves in ""Santa's Workshop"" paint millions of wooden boats and planes. Remember wood? This is a good-humored sixtysomething who wants to teach his grandkids the old-timey verities. Then he'll take a nap.

FALSE,B+,Family,Joe Higgs,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1731,"
In a chronically undifferentiated music, subtlety can be a curse, and though I've gotten to know every song here and have no trouble admiring most, I wish Higgs had rehired the musicians who backed Triumph three years ago. It's my guess--and with subtlety you have to guess some--that the likes of Chinna Smith, Wire Lindo, and Augustus Pablo made the difference between an acknowledged classic and an obscure near thing.
"
FALSE,B+,Music to Wake the Dead!,Hi-Life International,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4963,"
With Ghana's big-band dance style now regarded as overpolite in its country of origin, highlife's virtues are ripe for exploitation elsewhere--namely, London, where these expatriates perceived an opening and moved in. The melodies are so fetching they camouflage the overcasual vocals, but the three attempts to cash in on Zaire's big-band dance style don't kick home. Soukous isn't supposed to be polite.

FALSE,B+,I'm a Blues Man,Z.Z. Hill,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4964,"
The title boast is inauspicious. If Hill's 1981 Down Home turned into a phenomenal 450,000-sold-and-counting sleeper on mere stylistic integrity, then why didn't his 1982 The Rhythm and the Blues do almost as well? You guessed it--song quality went way down. But after the bad start it rebounds considerably here. Personal to Tommy Couch: is Jimmy Lewis ready for another album of his own, or is he a stay-at-home?
"
FALSE,B+,Jezebel,Justin Hines & the Dominoes,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7013,"
Homey lyrics (""Jah-jah will spank you"") and artful instrumental touches--I like the gentle calypso-styled horns and decorative guitar licks--may mean this is a great reggae album. But they may mean it's only a subtle one, and in such an understated genre subtlety risks extinction.
"
FALSE,B+,Stay Positive,The Hold Steady,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14156,"
Craig Finn's aim is leaner rock and deeper narrative--sharper hooks, heavier consequences. Formally, this is the only progress that makes sense for them, and sometimes they make it count. ""Stay Positive"" nails the travails of the aging rock band harder than ""Start Me Up"" because it's about fans, and ""Constructive Summer"" craftily confuses different ways to get hammered. Both grab hold from their opening riffs, too. But it's one thing to understand that you're too good for piano flourishes, another to find alternative means of roiling the collective gut every time.
"
FALSE,B+,If It Ain't One Thing . . .,Bill Holland & Rent's Due,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7016,"
Despite the decline of the genre, I still hear a lot of singer-songwriter records, most of which sound smoother than this--both Holland and his band lack polish in the vaguely jazzy style mature folkies fall into. They have plenty of bounce, though, and something about the tender yet skeptical common sense of Holland's lyrics suggests that he doesn't much care for smooth stuff anyway. Not that his raggedness is a plus. But if I were an a&amp;r man and heard some unknown put across songs as out-of-the-ordinary as ""This Fourth Year"" and ""Do the Mambo"" I'd say the hell with the cracked voice and sign him.
"
FALSE,B+,For the First Time Anywhere,Buddy Holly,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4968,"
If like me you were crying, waiting, hoping, or just wishing for new songs, dream on--other versions of the five originals and five covers are already familiar to owners of the six-disc Complete Buddy Holly import, most of whom bought this the week it was released. Those who've settled for 20 Golden Greats will greatly enjoy meeting the originals, especially since they sound much stronger in these recordings. And now here's wishing I could say the same for the covers--Holly rejected ""That's My Desire"" because it was a dog, and if the new ""Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"" is competitive with the one you know, the new ""Bo Diddley"" isn't.
"
FALSE,B+,Good Taste Is Timeless,Holy Modal Rounders,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1538,"
A sextet who put the communal principle into practice--five of them sing lead, four write. They celebrate meat (""Pork liver, lambies tongues, vienna sausage""), boobs (""They're big they're round they're all around""), and a bunch of farmers who danced till dawn one night in the spring of '65. They're not crazy about horoscopes, ""cute antics,"" or city wimmin who live with dogs. Except for the timeless reel of ""Spring of '65,"" their great moments are fast and relatively loud, probably because projecting soft and sweet isn't something any old communard can do. But their collective spirit is touched with poetry nonetheless.
"
FALSE,B+,Last Round,Holy Modal Rounders,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1540,"
In which Peter Stampfel and friends--including veteran Rounders Steve Weber and Robin Remailly, many Clamtones, and Antonia, composer of ""That Belly I Idolize"" and ""God, What Am I Doing Here"" (with ""Fucking Sailors in Chinatown"" yet to come)--prove that the counterculture still exists. Strange drug experiences are detailed, ooze is embraced, girls without underwear consume hoagies and juice. In short, Head Comix live.
"
FALSE,B+,Chimera EP,Homeboy Sandman,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15814,"
The beats on these six songs tend low and thrummy, less than catchy but they stick with you. The philosophical lyrics are braggier than usual, and in a touch I like, every damn one is reproduced on the cover of the vinyl version. First side, ""I Do Whatever I Want"" and especially ""Cops Get Scared of Me"" prove somewhat less than compelling. But the second begins with a a geopolitical analysis so much shrewder than the unpromising title ""Illuminati"" that the two excellent if lesser tracks that follow are, well, illuminated.
"
FALSE,B+,Kool Herc: Fertile Crescent,Homeboy Sandman,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16025,"
The guy who cashes ""checks for packs of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked"" is so skilled he risks being too smart for his own good--a little like Aesop Rock, except that a) he's not white and b) he's not an obscurantist. He wants to set his people on the right path and keeps thinking up explicit ways to say so. But none of them have gotten near that goal so far, not even theoretically, as they might if his skills included the ability to rise to actual hits, as opposed to pleasurable musicality, and also to sink to them. Not that that kind of skill comes any easier than the rhyming and rapping he's so good at. But I'm struck by my favorite song on this EP, ""Lonely People,"" in which a raggedy ""Eleanor Rigby"" refrain flexes against verses that begin: ""Look at all these wannabe famous people/All they talk about is famous people/Every statement be defaming people."" True enough, obviously. But it makes me wonder whether fame is really something he's willing to go for.
"
FALSE,B+,The Honest Cartwrights,The Honest Cartwrights,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4970,"
As craft enjoys its inevitable comeback, here are four guys who don't make it sound like a strain--over-thirties, I'll bet, big Steely Feat fans, only fresher because they've got something to prove, to themselves if no one else. And if you think alcoholism, masturbation, and nuclear war sound punky, tell me what punk band would cap their bomb song with a mournful ""There goes my career""?
"
FALSE,B+,Sweet Replies,Honey Cone,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7026,"
I know ""Want Ads"" is pure Jackson 5, but most of this is pure Vandellas. Producer-songwriter Ronald Dunbar must have had lots of advice from label owners Holland-Dozier-Holland--he uses every H-D-H trick and comes up with a few electronic effects of his own on this sturdy LP. Highlights: ""Are You Man Enough, Are You Strong Enough"" (to raise another man's child), ""The Day I Found Myself"" (was the day I left you).
"
FALSE,B+,Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance,Patterson Hood,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15772,"
Hood earned this avowedly autobiographical album by creating fictional and fictionalized characters for 20 years. Its dozen songs were conceived to bait a memoiristic account of a turbulent period or two in his twenties, but the book stopped coming midway through so he made an album out of them instead. Sweetly skeletal arrangements featuring various bandmates and his bassist dad underpin the quietest and most winning singing of his career, with lyrics so crystalline you never need the booklet. But you can bet their import would be clearer if the book was there too.
"
FALSE,B+,Stoneage Romeos,Hoodoo Gurus,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4972,"
""Tojo"" and ""Leilani"" and ""Zanzibar."" ""Death Ship"" and ""I Was a Kamikaze Pilot."" Hiccups from Lux Interior and counterpoint from the Pink Panther and attitudes from Mental as Anything and rhymes from Danny &amp; the Ramones. Those with no use for trivial pursuits can ignore this one, but if you enjoy the game when the fun isn't forced, these cheerfully maladjusted Aussies certainly beat what's been coming out of the bat-garages of L.A. and London these past two-three years. And if you want to read meaning and feeling into ""Arthur"" (who dies) or ""I Want You Back"" (which like ""My Girl"" isn't a cover) or even ""Zanzibar"" (a secret masterpiece, sez I), they--by which I mean the songs, not the band--won't spit in your eye.
"
FALSE,B+,Endless Boogie,John Lee Hooker,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11261,"
I like this double-lp more than either of two recent Bob Hite efforts. Hooker 'n' Heat (Liberty) features too much unaccompanied Hooker and tends to play on his status of a minor blues relic with hot-off-the-tape studio rapping, although the last side really boogies, as the saying goes. Coast to Coast Blues Band (United Artists) collects 14 20-year-old masters, mostly previously unreleased solo takes. The white audience hasn't much changed Hooker's sound, so the timeliness of Endless Boogie is an unmitigated plus, and producers Bill Szymczyk and Ed Michel get a relaxed groove out of a cast of supporting musicians (Brown, Miller, Davis, Radic, Naftalin) who can boogie Canned Heat right out of the studio.
"
FALSE,B+,The Healer,John Lee Hooker,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4975,"
Pushing 130 now, Hook will still walk anybody into the studio for cash up front. Though the pickings have been getting leaner, here anybody includes Carlos Santana, George Thorogood, Bonnie Raitt, Robert Cray, Canned Heat, and Los Lobos, most of whom commit crimes against his ageless essence that tone up the product considerably. And for the purist market, the product ends with four solo stomps.
"
FALSE,B+,Earth Song/Ocean Song,Mary Hopkin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7030,"
My taste for Hopkin's limpid prettiness may be eccentric, but there it is. She sings like the demure, starstruck adolescent she was until very recently, which lends her straightforward role-playing a revelatory poignancy lacking in the genteel atavism of the folkie madonnas she superficially resembles. Recommended: ""International.""
"
FALSE,B+,Cross Words,Larry Hosford,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7033,"
A funny country singer-songwriter with complicated emotions and an elusive, strangely ageless vocal persona--mellowed-out Homer and/or Jethro, perhaps, or comic-relief L.A. cowboy gone crackerbarrel, or crackers. His wife calls him Daddy, calls his bluff, and then just calls a cab, but don't worry--here's a man who don't worry--here's a man who knows that love gets easier when you own a blanket with a switch on it.
"
FALSE,B+,Cicero Park,Hot Chocolate,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1546,"
From the black-and-white London group that originated ""Brother Louie"" comes an album that might sound startling in retrospect and is impressive now. At the very least, its insightful confusions over class and race locate the honest roots of one kind of black conservatism. Both Mickie Most's precise, almost formal framing (pop hard rock veering toward disco) and the elocution of singer-composers Errol Brown (hard) and Tony Wilson (soft) make for an overall detachment unbroken by the passion of individual cuts. Strange to hear soul with a British accent.
"
FALSE,B+,Hot Chocolate,Hot Chocolate,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1547,"
Not quite as substantial as Cicero Park, but more startling, thanks to ""You Sexy Thing,"" the eccentrically wild-and-proper English-soul supersmash included hereupon.
"
FALSE,B+,Going Through the Motions,Hot Chocolate,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1551,"
For years I've resisted the idiot notion that this was a ""disco"" group because Errol Brown is black. So did the discos. The discos are still resisting. But I think this is the best disco parody since Silver Convention's Madhouse. Keynote: ""Mindless Boogie.""
"
FALSE,B+,Hot Tuna,Hot Tuna,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7035,"
Didn't figure I'd ever put on this country blues extrapolation by Jorma and Jack's Airplane spinoff while John Hurt and Gary Davis were at hand. But the shameful fact is that between the delicate guitar play and Jorma's unpretentious vocals and unexceptionable taste, I do.
"
FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Human League,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1564,"
I still don't believe humans bought these songs because they liked them. As the leader says, or intones, or even sings if you want to be polite: ""(Keep Feeling) [dig those parentheses] Fascination."" At their best, they're fascinating--masters of body-snatcher music, articulate simulated emotion fortified with the coldest hooks ever manufactured. Which is why their Jam-Lewis move was such a fraud. ""I'm only human/Of flesh and blood I'm made""--yeah, sure.
"
FALSE,B+,The Talk of the Town,Helen Humes,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1515,"
Humes's skill is manifest, but her aesthetic assumptions don't connect for me. The Afro-American forms from which rock and roll derived acknowledged their class (not race) origins, either directly (the plainspokenness of r&amp;b) or by outright avoidance (doowop's go-for-broke-fantasy). White kids may have identified with ghetto blacks out of the most abject simplemindedness, but they got candor (r&amp;b) or spiritual intensity (doowop) in the bargain. The adult nightclubbers for whom a jazz-blues stylist like Humes performed, on the other hand, related to the subtle twists of emotion implied by her intricate vocal inventions only because such intricacy takes for granted the protective veneer of culture, which is sophistication's bottom line. The hidden message of Humes's music is a ruling-class myth: that the most horrible suffering (catch the lyric of ""Good for Nothin' Joe"") is of manageable consequence. She denies the out-of-control. And I miss it.

FALSE,B+,Van Hunt,Van Hunt,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12335,"
""I love it when we make mistakes/Because once again it gives me a reason to complain,"" this not very Southern-fried ATL r&amp;b singer-songwriter-guitarist begins one song. After all, he's no love man: ""Words without hate/Would leave me nothing left to say."" In short, although Hunt's heaven-and-hell split may give his falsetto a devilish cast, it isn't just a fancy excuse for dogging around. It helps him think.  In ""Seconds of Pleasure,"" for instance, he finds a dozen meanings of life without mentioning sex once--even if an orgasm gave him the idea.
"
FALSE,B+,Long Journey,Michael Hurley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2368,"
Fingers trembling, the oft-cynical critic opened the new LP by the playful, sardonic folkie recluse. Without the Rounders or Jeffrey Fredericks to change paces, there was no way it could be another Have Moicy! (Aw.) But it might be woozy and charming, like Armchair Boogie. (Hey!) Or cute and dull, like Hi-Fi Snock Uptown. (Duh.) Also, the critic might fall asleep before finding out. Four months and many snoozes later, he arrived at a verdict: sardonic, charming, playful, cute, woozy, and only rarely dull. Highly recommended to Have Moicy! cultists. Hitbound: ""Hog of the Forsaken."" Whoopee.
"
FALSE,B+,Watertower,Michael Hurley,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2370,"
His core audience couldn't be much over 2000, and since I'm on its fringe, I don't much care that this typically unheralded, offhand, and tardy acoustic collection will make no converts. He still writes more calmly and curiously about the great beyond than anyone. What's more ""Broadcasting the Blues"" and ""I Paint a Design,"" break thematic ground--television and professionalism, respectively.
"
FALSE,B+,Land Speed Record,H���,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1566,"
Like a good Eno ambient, this raving nonstop live one provides just enough surface detail--recombinant noise guitar, voices tailing off like skyrockets, slogans such as ""data control,"" ""do the bee,"" and ""ultracore""--to function as mood rather than trance music, though admittedly not for the same kind of mood. Guaranteed to assuage the nervous tension of co-op conversion, labor strife, bad orgasm, World War III, and other modern urban annoyances. In other words: aarrghhh!

FALSE,B+,Slippin' and Slidin',J.B. Hutto & the New Hawks,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4989,"
Good new Chicago-style blues albums are rare occurrences that fall into two categories. On last year's, A.C. Reed enlivened an ordinary-plus groove with hilarious-minus material. On this year's, the now deceased slide guitar king makes his tightest and most raucous recorded music since 1968's definitive Hawk Squat! He gets telling (and tellingly understated) help from the Roomful of Blues horns. Telling-minus material would have helped even more.
"
FALSE,B+,House of Sleeping Beauties,Lucia Hwong,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2165,"
This intelligent if hyper-romantic new-age prestige item would make a nifty soundtrack for Lost Horizon and comes with the blessing of new-age titan (and sometimes soundtrack composer) Philip Glass, who identifies Hwong as one of those select young composers who are equally conversant with Eastern and Western music. Unfortunately, not many Western listeners will hear it as more than high-class chinoiserie--maybe those sopranos derive from Chinese opera, but they sound like Hollywood angels anyway. I trust the artist's decolletage derives from Chinese opera as well.
"
FALSE,B+,Power,Ice-T,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4990,"
I don't know about his role modeling: for anyone who thinks real men defy danger, dealing is obviously a surer and easier route to the gold than rapping. But he's got his own sound--flat, clipped, quick-lipped. And when he sticks to his subject, his narrative style is as gripping and understated as Islam's samples.
"
FALSE,B+,Home Invasion,Ice-T,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1594,"
At first it sounds as if the bad guys won--from sexy stories to o.g. kissoffs, he spends too much time proving he's still Ice Motherfucking T. But in fact he contextualizes himself as shrewdly as ever. He may write the misogynist rhymes--""I got an ill side that drips from my brain,"" he explains--but he leaves the worst to DJ Evil E and 2 Live Crew sicko Brother Marquis, the conceit being that some black men think women are hoes just like some black men wanna off cops, and that every one of these black men deserves to be heard. Which I buy, sort of, while noting that in the lead track a narrator posing as Ice-T offs a cop himself, and not for the last time. ""Addicted to Danger"" is a shrewd gangsta fable; ""99 Problems"" takes bitch-talk over the top where it belongs; Grip plays his Yo-Yo; the carefully phrased ""Race War"" and the self-aggrandizing ""Message to a Soldier"" and the amazing ""Gotta Lotta Love"" (is that a bridge?) are as politically felt as the greatest PE. But in a rapper as musically expedient as Ice-T, pro forma claims to hard prowess are rarely of much interest in themselves. Blame them on the bad guys.
"
FALSE,B+,Vital Idol,Billy Idol,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4996,"
In which the con artist who convinced the majors the EP was a profit-taker makes something of an even more useless and cost-effective marketing ploy, the remix. The more he pixilates his pseudosex with studio sensationalism--reverb, big beat, every synthesized redundancy know to applied science--the more closely he approaches his cartoon essence. Second side's just macho disco nevertheless, but the first side is macho disco at its . . . well, let's use a technical term here: hottest.

FALSE,B+,Raw Power,Iggy and the Stooges,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6272,"
In which David Bowie remembers ""the world's forgotten boy"" long enough to sponsor an album--and mixes it down till it's thin as an epicure's wrist. The side-openers, ""Search and Destroy"" and ""Raw Power,"" voice the Iggy Pop ethos more insanely (and aggressively) than ""I Wanna Be Your Dog."" But despite James Williamson's guitar, the rest disperses in their wake.

Still wish there were some rudimentary verbality here, but the music has won me over--the title track is the most gorgeous reggae crooning I've ever heard, and the rest of the album follows in its sweet wake like one of those half-remembered dreams that makes you glow the next day.
"
FALSE,B+,Paris au Printemps,Image Publique S.A.,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5767,"
Supposedly let out of the pen to head a bootleg off at the specialty shops, this live album has a suitably cynical look, but mostly it just sharpens the drums and guitar of songs from 1978's flat and hasty First Issue, ""Public Image"" unfortunately not among them. It cuts deepest on the previously unrecorded (I think) ""Psalmodie,"" which could almost make you think John Lydon liked rock and roll.
"
FALSE,B+,Body Talk,Imagination,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5000,"
Possessed of a sweet, undemanding falsetto, not unlike those of second-string Miracle Billy Griffin and second-string Temptation Damon Harris, black Englishman Leee John knows better than to be expressionistic--this music is just as sweet and just as undemanding, anchored by simple keyboard hooks and drum patterns and never venturing beyond a croon in tempo, volume, or message. Even those entranced by his trio's current dance hit, ""Just an Illusion,"" might as well buy the album--the formula actually gathers charm over a whole side.
"
FALSE,B+,In the Heat of the Night,Imagination,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5001,"
Most English disco albums project the music into a chrome-plated video-game ""future""; this one conjoins it to a flesh-and-blood rock and roll ""past."" Sweeter and simpler--but no dumber--than their alienated-adolescent counterparts across the color line. Leee John and friends depict themselves on the cover as Flash Gordon-style gladiator-cosmonauts on an endless keyboard into space, but they're love men and almost soul men nevertheless, and one more hook as hypnotic as ""Just an Illusion""'s would have every android from here to Triton making out on the couch.

Way back in the 1960s I tried to figure out whether these acoustic Scots were magic or bullshit and concluded that they were both. But lately they've lost something.

Although they've never broken top twenty, this quartet has scored eight r&amp;b hits since 1972, four of them top ten and every one included on this efficient long player. The mode is post-Smokey with Claudette reinstated--three men and one woman who excel in the contained ""love"" vocal style, with Chuck Jackson adding his gift for recitative (a truly great ironic chuckle). I like the songs, too--but admit that they're not bright enough for pop.

Still deciding what to rap about on their debut, they deliver the eternal we're-good-rappers-so-listen-up with their already trademark matter-of-factness. To hammer their point home, they provide hooks in highly reliable fashion, two of the best attached to lyrics more lyrical than the titles ""Yo"" and ""Wow"" portend. On two successive six-minute closers, however, they either run out of ideas or mistake slowcore for a good one.

FALSE,B+,Palimpsesto,Inti-Illimani,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5008,"
Exiled in Italy since the 1972 coup, these Andean traditionalists from Chile have softened their conception just like so many other folk professionals--compare this to the austere 1971 Canto Para una Semilla. So it's not surprising that the lead cut here is an original composition that sounds like French soundtrack music played on exotic flutes and strings. What is surprising is that it makes you want to see the movie--and that except perhaps during ""Danza,"" the instrumental which opens side two, the group's romanticism is somewhat less winning when expressed more ""authentically.""

All Gregory Isaacs songs sound the same, but some of them sound more the same than others, and for a long time I was ready to relegate his best-distributed LP to the Land of Nod. Turns out there isn't a bad track on side one, though I don't guarantee any great ones. And don't forget side two.

Cumulatively, Isaacs's resourcefulness is very impressive--he almost always manages to vary his sad, soothing mid-tempo formula not just riddimically but with enduring bits of melody and observation. But because the formula is sometimes too soothing he needs more than bits to go over the top. Rastafarian marginal differentiation fans will love this record.

From ""Sacrifice,"" in which spirituality and even beauty itself follows inevitably from the comprehension of oppression, side one establishes the subtle power and grace of Isaacs' rather urban reggae, not least because it stops off at Billy Vera &amp; Judy Clay's ""Storybook Children.""

At least once the great lover takes his formulaic bent too far--""Private Secretary"" is a remake of the sex fantasy ""Night Nurse"" in which he plays a boss instead of a patient, no advance. And on ""Sheila"" and elsewhere the melodies are banal rather than simple. But the rest of the time they're not only simple, but less simple than they seem, enhanced as usual by the Roots Radics' profound angularity and Isaacs's smooth concentration and subtle hooks.

After sinking into ever more unctuous hits-plus-filler formula for most of the decade, JA's love king hied to producer Gussie Clarke, who put contract songwriter Carleton Hines on the case. Despite some icky moments, notably a duet about feeling irie, the move is for the good: there's a light touch to this music--Isaacs whispering and murmuring around diffident horn-section filigrees--that I'd call sexy. Maybe even irie, who knows.

Still, with ""That Lady"" their most original original in years, Ernie soaring around thrillingly on his magic guitar, and the others popping their various things in ever more winning combinations, this is their sexiest music in years. Just because they manhandled ""Fire and Rain"" doesn't mean they can't improve on James's schlock. In fact, between their sense of rhythm and their knee-jerk sincerity they make all three covers work--except for the mental jasmine part, of course.

The Isleys are one of the great music-business success stories--in a decade when the artists were supposed to take over the industry, they're one of the few (along with Jefferson Lear Jet) to make a go of their own label. But though T-Neck puts out excellent product, product is all it is. This two-LP compilation, in which their Buddah-distributed material reverts to the Isleys' company (it's virtually identical to Buddah's 1976 The Best . . . package), reminds us that even back when they were inventing their shtick they were also victims of it. The only great songs are ""It's Your Thing"" and ""Work to Do""; they reuse the same harmonies and dynamics again and again. The Isleys to own, probably--but there's no doubt you can live without it.

Cut around 1965, while Hendrix was still part of the Isley's band, these casual sessions, remixed to push his guitar up with the voices, are far superior to Curtis Knight's Hendrix tapes. Make you wonder what would have happened if they'd been released at the time. Especially on ""Move Over Let Me Dance,"" Hendrix anticipates effects Clapton introduced on ""Sunshine of My Love,"" but in a less inflated context--could have blown some minds in Harlem. Not all of the music is don't-miss great. But it's all historic--and you can dance to it.

FALSE,B+,Snow Job,Jack Frost,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1621,"
It's 1993. Grant McLennan of the much-mourned Go-Betweens meets Steve Kilbey of the barely-missed Church for a second one-off, written and recorded on the spot and then stuck in a box until they find time to finalize it, which takes years. The songs evoke romantic moods and vague experiences rather than nailing the literal-cum-ineffable; the music strives for effect rather than detail or even ambience. By McLennan's standards, it's hokey, mysterioso, fulla keybs. Yet its schlock disposability and glam brio generate the crass charm McLennan's class act too often avoids. Too bad only cultists will care--and worse still that they'll probably reject it on principle.

Jackson is a fifty-six-year-old gravedigger who's been on the folk blues circuit since 1964 and has three albums on Arhoolie, though I'd never heard of him till this one. His guitar style is eclectic, as befits a man who got his best songs from Blind Boy Fuller and Blind Blake 78s but who also played in a country band in the early '40s. His voice is gutteral yet well-defined. No innovator, and not as arresting through a whole side as he is at the outset, he's nevertheless responsible for the most pleasing (and well-recorded) new country blues record I've heard in years.

In part because deciding that Jesus wasn't my savior was the toughest intellectual work of my life, I'm not much of a gospel fan, and that goes double for the kind of stately midtempo message singers I avoid in every genre--I don't even really get Aretha Franklin's Amazing Grace, hailed as her very peak by many nonbelievers with their fingers crossed. Nonetheless, this is Mahalia Jackson, and I've tried, Lord, I've tried--particularly by buying her early stuff, from before Columbia turned her into what the indefatigable gospel scholar Anthony Heilbut once called ""a black Kate Smith."" But this career-spanning, Heilbut-compiled selection of live rarities reached me as my earlier tries hadn't, so with other Mahalia versions of half its songs already in my iTunes, I compared and contrasted. Heilbut's finds won every time. At their very best--""Keep Your Hand on the Plow,"" ""Didn't It Rain,"" the storytelling ""Jesus Met the Woman at the Well""--they rock and roll with such grace I shout about it. Often they remind me that the piano is a percussion instrument. And at the very least they're more relaxed. Yet in the end, there's still a bunch of stately message singing here.

Once you get past the slipshod cynicism of Motown's catalogue exploitation, you have to admit that this mostly remixed, sometimes synthed-up mishmash has its charms and even uses--that in fact it's superior to the ""real"" 1975 best-of the label long ago deleted. I love the previously unreleased ""Twenty-Five Miles"" and the preteen-sings-the-blues ""Doggin' Around,"" could live without the two J5 nonhits, and will no doubt pull this down when I want to remember ""Dancing Machine"" and ""Rockin' Robin.""

Anybody who charges studio hackery is too narrow-minded to be able to hear pros out-doing themselves. Studio mastery is more like it, the strongest and most consistent black pop album in years, defining Jam &amp; Lewis's revamp of Baby Sis as the mainstream and then inundating it in rhythmic and vocal power. But what made Thriller a miracle wasn't consistency--it was genius like ""Beat It"" and ""Billie Jean"" and the unknowable allure of the pure star. The closest thing to genius here is the CD-only ""Leave Me Alone,"" which isn't all that close and also suggests what's happened to his allure--the more knowable he gets, the more fucked up he seems. This is a record that damn near wrecks perfectly good dancin' and singin' with subtext. He's against burglary, speeding, and sex (""Dirty Diana"" is as misogynistic as any piece of metal suck-my-cock), in favor of harmonic convergence and changing the world by changing the man in the mirror. His ideal African comes from Liberia. And he claims moonwalking makes him a righteous brother. Like shit.

Producer Raeford Gerald's ""My Man, a Sweet Man"" and ""I Miss You Baby"" are as melodically upbeat as Jackson's own ""Ask Me What You Want,"" and she delivers a ghetto sermon so unfashionably judgmental it makes me want to shout amen just to be contrary. But most of the rest is so nondescript that even Jackson's big, rough, tremendously vital voice can't bring it to life. Marginal.

Jackson's specialty--the funky truth about husbands, wives, and other women--is worth this sequel. As with Caught Up, she has her theme in control about eighty percent of the time, and her tone has become even nastier. But since she no longer has the advantage of surprise, her stridency is beginning to seem a little forced.

The songs aren't getting any stronger, bad news for a concept artist who's slowly running out of concept. But ""Feel Like Making Love"" (Bad Company's, not Roberta Flack's--score one for Millie), ""A House for Sale,"" and Clarence Reid's super-funky ""Do What Makes the World Go Round"" combine with a terrific dramatic monologue about scoring at a party and a tour de force demonstration of sexual noises to push this one over the line.

As a convinced monogamist, I've always approved of Millie's no-shit shtick--there's a lot more commitment to love and marriage in her acerbic skepticism-going-on-cynicism than in the old escapist fantasies or the new therapeutic bromides. Still, shtick does wear out, so I'm happy to report that ""Why Say You're Sorry"" is her sharpest lyric in years and ""Logs and Thangs"" her funkiest monologue. Also, the title tune has a line about bosses that should raise class consciousness a notch.

FALSE,B+,A Moment's Pleasure,Millie Jackson,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7087,"
If only because it's so patently unlikely to result in dancefloor hits, the arrant discofication is annoying at first--these songs don't need David Van De Pitte's clamorous strings and horns or bass lines that pine for a kick-drum. But Brandye's back-ups add extra nuance to Jackson's ever subtler singing, and Clayton Ivy's guitar obbligatos insure a flow her declamatory approach often lacks. What's more, the disco touches lend Millie's bawdy moralism special relevance to the latest arena of modern hedonism. If only her lyric on ""Seeing You Again"" didn't sound like an ad for Eastern Airlines I'd be convinced she was above gross hedonism herself.

Because her dirty mouth is more purely a shock effect than most pop concepts, it's sure to lose its zing for the audience even if Millie stays interested, which according to her last few studio albums she hasn't. But this one-volume follow-up to 1979's live double is also a de facto best-of, claiming the pop classic ""This Is It"" from Kenny Loggins and the pop throwaway ""Passion"" from Rod Stewart as well as preserving for posterity at least one rap that makes me squirm, and I don't squirm easy.

The title is misleading--this meeting of the bullshitters is more groove than rap. Not that it's devoid of spoken vamps or pointed byplay--the joyful havoc they wreak on ""Do You Wanna Make Love"" transforms it from pap to aphrodisiac. But mostly it gives Millie a chance to get out of her bag and really sing, with Isaac playing the likable foil and the Muscle Shoals boys making it sexy.

Believing correctly that what distinguishes Jackson's harmolodic fusion from Coleman's and Ulmer's isn't less musicality so much as no fun, Bill Laswell persuades him to beef up the themes and steady the beat. The upshot is the swinging ""Software Shuffle"" and other stuff. But it's also a record that tends to blare like regular old fusion, and it's not fun enough.

There may be drummers who can cut Jackson, but nobody else moves so fluidly from free time to on-the-one. I only wish he'd indulge himself with a drummer's record. The music is never less than dense and jumpy, and he's keeping things compact--eleven cuts total. But handing your themes over to (guitarist) Bern Nix and (violinist) Billy Bang is no way to show off your composing. Stanley Crouch has a word for this kind of thing: eso, as in esoteric. Pretty good eso, sure. But even in my head I don't dance to it.

Admittedly, the charm of hearing an eleven-year-old cover Smokey, Stevie, and the Delfonics may not be enduring.

My friend who goes to discos tells me the Jacksons are the first major artists to put out a real disco album--designed for dancers, and listeners be damned. This may well be true--certainly the guitars and electric keyboards are more noteworthy than the singing. He also tells me it's the Jacksons' best album since who knows when, and what's surprising is that he's right again. This is a tribute to the aforementioned instruments, but the singing is fine, and if a lot of the songs live up to the album title, that ain't necessarily bad. For listeners (dancers too): ""What You Don't Know.""

FALSE,B+,Anthology,Jackson 5,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7074,"
The only one of Motown's triple-LP retrospectives to concentrate on (or even include much) '70s music documents an institution in decline. Initially, the company marshalls everything it's got for one final push--not for nothing was the group's songwriting-production combine called The Corporation, and it's a measure of their seriousness that they asked the Crusaders to help with the tracks. But within two years they'd run out of gas--all the mini-comebacks after that, even the dancing-machine coup, were flukes. The proof is that the old-formula filler often surpasses the desperate imitations that became minor hits--better ""E-Ne-Me-Ne-Mi-Ne-Moe"" than ""Skywriter"" or ""A Little Bit of You."" The selection includes Michael's hits, Jermaine's hit, the works, and as the other albums disappear it will become essential in its way. But not to listen to, much.

Victim of a truly perverse heightened expectation syndrome, this expert pop record is certainly in a league with Destiny and Triumph, now remembered as unjustly ignored black-music milestones by many of those who unjustly ignored them. What it lacks is Michael at the pitch of gulping syncopation we've learned to love so well, although I do think his two turns suffer the worst backlash of all--better a Stones throwaway than a Wings throwaway, and better the high-strung delicacy of ""Be Not Always"" than the mundane sensitivity of, say, ""If You're Ever in My Arms Again."" As for the Other Bros., this showcases them more vividly than the tour of the same name--there can never be too many crafty tunes about wanting a body or saving the world.

The naive, out-of-the-mouths-of-careerists clumsiness is endearing partly because it gets at truths too obvious to interest the sophisticated; the assumption that the word modern has sociopolitical import, for instance, is laughably autodidactic at one level and yet not without resonance when pounded out over and over. Would that the pounding were a little more flexible--this might rock as invitingly as their first if only it were varied with some appropriate covers. How about ""Kicks""?

Likable lads, as always, and improving themselves, too. The music has gained density and power, and they do OK with the social commentary--nice to see some empathy for doomed middle-class plodders like ""Smithers-Jones"" instead of the usual contempt, and ""The Eton Rifles"" and ""Little Boy Soldiers"" place them firmly on the left. On the other hand, some of this is pretty dumb (""Wasteland,"" ugh), and overarrangement (not so much extra instruments as dramatic vocal shifts) is no way to disguise thin melody.

They never got past second base here for the same reason cricket didn't. What's made Paul Weller such a hero in England is his Englishness--ever since he outgrew the pure punk urbanism of In the City, his closely observed lyrics have worked to reflect a national culture exactly as universal as dozens of others. Given his charming but nonetheless limiting musical limitations, he's no more a world musician than Winston Rodney or Sunny Ad������������������, and probably less. Because he doesn't share a gift for the riff with his mod hero Pete Townshend, even his hits get across more on tension and tenderness than on such body-balms as melody or his proudly proferred beat. This is where you'll find the hits, and where to begin. If he hits you where you live, or where you wished you live, All Mod Cons is the "

Kittenish one moment and cathouse the next, James offers disappointingly subtle pleasures for such a big singer--except for two ASCAP standards, the title song is the only one I'd care to hear from someone else, and not even James's foxy delight in her own moods can salvage some of them. Nor will the orchestrations--conventional in blues, soul, and big-band modes--draw anyone in. But these days only Tina Turner (who couldn't provide subtle pleasures if she wanted to) seems to get much of a kick out of the down and dirty, and James's uninhibited sense of humor and fondness for sexual combat finally jollies this album over the line.

Unbeknownst to white people, she was Soul Sister Number Two--more and better top-20 r&amp;b back when than Dionne Warwick, Martha Reeves, Tina Turner, Carla Thomas, Irma Thomas, any black woman besides Soul Sister Number One and Diana Ross, who belongs to pop. She's been a cult heroine since around the time she kicked heroin in 1974--albums with Wexler and Toussaint, tour with the Stones, etc. But her many post-'60s recordings have disappointed: often out of touch with herself (didn't kick alcohol till much later), she could coast on savvy and a fabulously down-and-dirty voice. So I expected not much from what turns out to be her best album since she met Barry Beckett at the Tell Mama sessions in 1968. Part of the difference is Beckett, the producer who's constructed the solidest bottom and sharpest top of her career, but mostly it's the something extra she invests in these half-remembered Memphis-type standards. Not all the way there--all the way there is hard after 35 years in the biz. But not cult-only either.

Produced by the well-bred rhythm section of drummer Donto James and bassist Sametto James, this is half riskily irreverent rock and roll and half perilously imperious blues. Beyond an inconclusive Creedence cover, she co-owns every non-blues--""Miss You""! ""Gotta Serve Somebody""! ""Try a Little Tenderness""! Otis's chortling ""Hawg for Ya""! Al's unremembered ""Rhymes""! ""Hound Dog,"" which counts aab or not! But neither the horns nor the B.B. homages will inspire the dutiful bluesboy to return to his long-abandoned O.V. Wright and Little Milton studies. From Big Mama Thornton to Shemekia Copeland, no woman has sung such material with more power. So maybe power isn't what it needs. Maybe it needs more irreverence.

James is such a pro I'm sure he didn't even want to top Street Songs. Might give his fans the wrong idea, and soon he'd actually have to work. So there's nothing as visionary as ""Give It to Me Baby"" or the epochal ""Super Freak"" here, and no protest numbers either. But all of the fast ones are such bad fun. Stealing his licks from G. Clinton &amp; Co. (or maybe himself, who cares anymore?), he's the nearest thing to a pop musician in the rock and roll sense that today's black charts--not to mention today's white charts--can offer. And in that great tradition he should never sing a ballad again.

Mandinka folk music reconceived by Mory Kante's multi-instrumentalist brother, whose emotional tenor soars over interwoven balafon (a big, deeply resonant xylophone) and kora (an intricately harplike guitar), with his guitar talking underneath and harmonies from women surnamed Diabate and Keita adding commentary and color. In Guinea, it's reconceived Mandinka folk music; in the U.S. it's world beat as world music, exotically pleasurable education for the ears.

FALSE,B+,Magna Carta Holy Grail,Jay-Z,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16072,"
After too many plays, this holding action won me over. Deeper than catchy, Timbaland's music is the precondition on an album that pits Basquiat against Blue--black man as artistic rebel versus black man as family stalwart. But the breakthrough only came when I started grinning every time I heard him advise his daughter regarding the Basquiat in his kitchen: ""Lean on the shit, Blue, you own it."" And though later he swears, ""I love my niggas more than my own blood,"" nowhere is black more beautiful than in the person of his own wife: ""Sleep every night with Mona Lisa/The modern version with better features."" In short, family wins both times. Give it up to the one where Beyonce pledges gangsta devotion and, best of all, the one where the would-be billionaire looks back at the betrayals of his own departed head of family with something that feels like dread.

FALSE,B+,Surrealistic Pillow,Jefferson Airplane,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10992,"
I dismissed this as ""amplified Peter, Paul &amp; Mary"" in the first piece of rock criticism I ever wrote; later, under the influence of ""Somebody to Love,"" a few powerful Jorma Kaukonen riffs, my ex-folkie girlfriend, and the prevalent cultural vibes, I recanted--in print, yet. Now I think I was closer the first time. There's good stuff here, but Spencer Dryden plays the drums as if trying out for the Riders of the Purple Sage, the sarcasm is as vapid as the optimism, and the folk-pretty melodies simply do not carry lyrics like ""When I see a girl like that/It brightens up my day.""
"
FALSE,B+,The Worst of Jefferson Airplane,Jefferson Airplane,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1680,"
For someone who enjoys their albums, like me, this factitious compilation--fifteen cuts is a lot, but though it includes all (two) of their AM smashes it doesn't even pretend to be a singles anthology--is a waste. But for someone who finds their albums wanting, like me, it has its uses, especially as overview. These folks are literate both verbally and musically. Their chops don't quite equal their tastes--""White Rabbit,"" with its bolero build and librarian's-eye view of lysergic acid, is perfect, but ""Chushingura"" is almost as sloppy in the picking as ""Today"" is in the sentiment. They were hippies when becoming a hippie took beatnik initiative and psychedelic imagination. And when they're good they make the for-better-or-worse evolution of rock and roll into rock seem both appropriate and inevitable.

FALSE,B+,Garland Jeffreys,Garland Jeffreys,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1334,"
A classy singer-songwriter with staying power; a classless singer-songwriter with at least two bags of tricks. ""Black and white as can be"" right down to his vocals, he's a living breathing advertisement for the mongrelization of the races, and it's his existential dilemma that permits Michael Cuscuna a gourmet coproduction in which Stonesy blues shuffles rub elbows with reggae from Kingston and a song about the zoo that makes Paul Simon sound like Marlin Perkins. Is he streetwise? Damn right--wise enough to find the streets a little scary.
"
FALSE,B+,Escape Artist,Garland Jeffreys,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5069,"
After four years of having been, Jeffreys makes like a macher. With Roy Bittan playing the colorist, Garland's affinities with Uncle Bruce are suddenly obvious, and with Big Youth and Linton Kwesi Johnson on counterpoint his reggae ties have never been firmer. ""Modern Lovers,"" his basic theme, is one he knows more intimately than, let us say, Hall &amp; Oates, but my two faves break the mood: ""Jump Jump,"" his greatest name-dropping song and an anthem for rock critics everywhere, and ""Miami Beach,"" Dennis Bovell-produced American dub that's too strong musically and politically to relegate to a bonus EP. Jeffrey's weakness for doggerel sticks out when he's writing this well, and the Springsteen connection reminds me that Ghost Writer's static rhythms cut into its durability. But this man should be given the keys to every city whose streets he walks--ours first.

FALSE,B+,Break It Up,Jemina Pearl,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14753,"
""Wave goodbye with a middle finger,"" the ex-Nashville ex-teenpunk advises bands on the run and singers who pack off to Brooklyn after the other guys break it up. Though the young are sure to discern ""maturity"" in her primal albeit produced solo debut, the rest of us will wonder how she'll adjust to the limitations of astrology, nervous system blues, ""I Hate People"" featuring Mr. Iggy Pop, and the theatrical hissy fit. The reason we care is that she retains her spunk, tunes, and way with a phrase. And not only is she talented, she's really cute.

FALSE,B+,Waylon and Willie,Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7119,"
Commercially, this collaboration was a sure shot. They could have hammed it up or run through on automatic; they could even have avoided connecting altogether. But as it happens, this is the strongest album either has made in a while, as full of enthusiasm and devoid of posturing as a dressing-room singout. As in most dressing-room singouts, though, things get a little too loose at times--sometimes it's hard to tell whether they remember the words.

FALSE,B+,Darklands,The Jesus and Mary Chain,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1686,"
""I'm going to the darklands/To talk in rhyme/With my chaotic soul."" Right--they know damn well their putatively erotic-existential despair speaks to thrill-seeking normals by making chaos rhyme. Seems inevitable for them to take their folk-simple hook-ditties in an acoustic direction, too. Yet as a normal I miss the feedback--without all that chaos, the trick just doesn't come off death-defying enough.

FALSE,B+,I Love Rock 'n' Roll,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1714,"
Covering the Dave Clark Five and ""Little Drummer Boy"" on the same side is a great schlock yea-saying move, but a move is all it is--makes me want to hear the originals rather than play the side again. Maybe if I knew the real ""Nag"" I'd feel the same about that. As it is, ""Nag"" has a spark that's lacking in all of Jett's originals except the complementary ""You're Too Possessive."" And I love rock 'n roll for its spark.

FALSE,B+,Album,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5072,"
It's one of Jett's virtues that unlike so many rock traditionalists she doesn't let her sense of humor undercut her commitment--""Fake Friends"" (cf. ""Back Stabbers"") and ""The French Song"" (cf. ""Triad"") are the real stuff. It's also one of her virtues that unlike so many other rock traditionalists she does have a sense of humor. Even makes fun of the Stones--they called ""Starfucker"" ""Star Star,"" she covers it as ""Star Star"" (cassette-only until retailers pressured MCA into taking it off, still available as twelve-inch B-side), then dubs her own ""Scumbag"" ""Coney Island Whitefish."" And if you don't see what's so funny about her tuneless ""Everyday People"" (the twelve-inch in question), I guarantee Sylvester Stewart is laughing all the way to his next label. No joke: her nagging love-is-pain clich�"
FALSE,B+,Glorious Results of a Misspent Youth,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1715,"
Seekers after the unvarnished rock and roll truth needn't haunt used record stores and postbohemian beer joints--here it is in all its generic glory, with an independent woman on top providing a preideological political kicker. The problem for those of us who still care about ""art"" is that it's all a little too generic--in 1984 they may be better than the Stones, but they'll never be as good. I don't miss Mick--if Joan's lyrics are rarely clever, they're always pithy, and these days she's the smarter singer--but I do miss Keith, some musician whose writing/playing might make the songs sound like models rather than examples of the genre.
"
FALSE,B+,Good Music,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5073,"
The title signifies something cruder than coverees Hendrix, Richman, and Beach Boys, who aren't likely to show up on WNCN or WPAT themselves, and its moral certitude is what you have to love about her. She's a bit simple, our Joan, but so undoubting she can get away with transporting Route 128 to the West Side Highway. And even though only three or so of these selections--""Good Music,"" ""Black Leather,"" maybe ""Just Lust"" or ""This Means War,"" none of the covers--will be on her song list in 1990, it's heartening to know she'll be there in 1990, and that she'll sound like she did in 1982.

FALSE,B+,Up Your Alley,Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1716,"
Jesus I wish she was just a little bit better than she actually is, and by closing side one with the cover exacta ""Tulane"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog,"" she comes this close to convincing me she's made the leap. But though nobody else male or female puts out such a reliable brand of hard rock, lean and mean and pretension-free, and though being female gives her an edge in a quintessentially male subgenre, not since her start-up has she made something special of her populist instincts. It's almost as if that's the idea.
"
FALSE,B+,Arriba El Norte,Flaco Jiminez,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5074,"
Comparison to Santiago Jr.'s more generic-sounding Familia y Tradicion leaves no doubt as to why Flaco has been the hep Chicano box-squeezer since Doug Sahm brought him to New York in 1972. For this brother, traditionalism doesn't mean straight and square--he's sprightly and flexible, ""pop"" only because he's not allergic to change. And this 1969-1980 compilation from his San Antonio label, complete with translations and knowledgeable notes, ought to be the Flaco for me. But though a similar collection by his rock-oriented compadre Steve Jordan did the trick, I find that I'm still on the outside after ten plays, which ought to be enough. I'm a New Yorker who doesn't know Spanish, and folk music isn't my thing. Until something changes, so be it.
"
FALSE,B+,An Innocent Man,Billy Joel,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5078,"
His art album having gone platinum and failed to clear bottom line, Joel comes at his poor neglected generation direct, peddling a nostalgia no one will mistake for philosophy. And although he's still a wordy bastard who can't leave a simple piece of music alone, the pre-Beatle ""concept""--unmistakable references to the Four Seasons and Otis Redding (as if Otis entered Billy's world before the Beatles, but never mind) marking a selfconsciously simplified musical orientation--does rein in his showbiz ornateness. A good half of these songs have the timeless melodic appeal of the greatest pop (the greatest pre-rock pop, but never mind)--the chorus he stole from ""L. v. Beethoven"" is by no means the most pleasing thing here. And though his Stax horns are way too ornate, that doesn't mean they're no fun.
"
FALSE,B+,In Style,David Johansen,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7128,"
Johansen is equal to his more soulish musical concept--no ""disco,"" just slower tempos, subtle be-yoo-ty, and some reggae--but he doesn't have the chops to get on top of it, and while this is solid stuff, the best of it tends to thin out a little. Although the problem isn't how often you think ""that's bad"" but how often you don't think ""that's great,"" the record is summed up for me by ""Big City,"" the most banal lyric he's ever written. Until now, you see, he'd never written any banal lyrics at all. Now he's got three or four.
"
FALSE,B+,Caribou,Elton John,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7133,"
I give up. Of course he's a machine, but haven't you ever loved a machine so much it took on its own personality? I was reminded of my first car, a '50 Plymouth. Then I decided Elton was more like a brand-new Impala I once rented on a magazine's money. Then I remembered that I ended up paying for that car myself. Yes, I hate the way he says ""don't diszgard me"" too, but ""The Bitch Is Back"" is my most favorite song.
"
FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Elton John,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7134,"
I don't agree that singles are Elton's metier--his method is too hit-or-miss to permit such a surefire formula, and some of his best stuff (""Your Sister Can't Twist,"" ""Solar Prestige a Gammon"") has proven too wild or weird for a&amp;r/p.d. consciousness. There are no clinkers here, and I suppose if you only want one of his albums this is it. But it's stylistically ragged, two of its four great cuts are also on Honky Chateau, and I'd just as soon hear the first side of Caribou.
"
FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits Volume II,Elton John,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7138,"
The two previously-unavailable-on-LP originals here are peaks, but the two covers are dippy. Plus the lead cut from Caribou and two hits from Rock of the Westies and leftovers from 1971 and 1976 and the climax of Captain Fantastic. Is this product necessary? Depends on who's doing the needing.
"
FALSE,B+,Johnson's Whacks,The Jimmy Johnson Band,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7141,"
Syl's cousin performed better on Alligator's Living Chicago Blues Volume I, but only marginally, and he compensates by showing unexpected chops as a writer. Whether hoping to make the cover of Living Blues magazine or complaining that women aren't loyal any more, he comes across as a bold-faced contemporary. But his basic wail starts to sound thin after a while, his band is only solid, and his guitar can't carry the extra load.
"
FALSE,B+,Bass Culture,Linton Kwesi Johnson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2064,"
As if to dispel suspicions that he's an interloper, the poet emphasizes music--sometimes dubwise, sometimes jazzy, with guitarist John Kpiaye cutting the difference in a satisfying show of state-of-the-art support. But Johnson's command of the tonalities and rhythms of Jamaican English is the most musical thing about an artist whose musicality isn't in question, and the more room he gives his players, the less that leaves him.
"
FALSE,B+,Total Explosion,Syl Johnson,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7144,"
Johnson has tended to disappear in between Willie Mitchell and Al Green, but on this LP he takes his harmonica up to the microphone and stands clear as a lapsed bluesman. Good move. His voice is still shriller, and more strained than Green's, but that can be a satisfying distinction in the right context. A comparison of his unexceptionably dynamic rendition of ""Take Me to the River"" to Green's sublime original, however, renews one's understanding of what divine spark might be. Although I wish the folks at Hi would let him sing just one Junior Wells song, say, they've done him proud.
"
FALSE,B+,Ms. Fine Brown Frame,Syl Johnson,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5090,"
Johnson has the rep and pedigree of a down-home treasure, but like so many of his fellow workers both renowned (Johnnie Taylor) and obscure (O.V. Wright), he's rarely better than his material if almost never worse. Having released bluesy soul records out of sweet home Chicago since the dissolution of his '70s label, where his final album was a dismal piece of out-of-it disco, Johnson here constructs his best collection since 1975's Total Explosion and his best side ever on the firm foundation of the title track, a superb piece of out-of-it disco. And may well have something equally interesting to show us in another seven years.
"
FALSE,B+,Essential Blues Masters,Tommy Johnson,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15723,"
This Johnson is a Delta legend best appreciated by blues aesthetes like the late great Robert Palmer--who hears, for instance, ""a slippery, danceable swing"" in guitar accompaniments others account regionally generic. Johnson messed with your woman, drank Sterno for breakfast, and claimed meetings at the crossroads with you-know-who. But he only recorded for two years of his 1896-1956 lifespan. Like most collections available, this one preserves 17 tracks and 13 songs, five of which I have now removed from my iPod for reasons of distressed audio, compositional shortfall, or (usually) both. I've also banished three alternate versions, although I kept both scratchy ""Black Mare Blues"" just to hear New Orleans's Nehi Boys kick in their piano and clarinet, which do Johnson a lot more good than you-know-who. As I hear it, he has two drop-dead classics in his kit: the indelible ""Big Road Blues"" and the clarion ""Cool Drink of Water Blues."" The frailing ""Maggie Campbell Blues"" and the confessional ""Canned Heat Blues"" are close behind, and the rowdy-to-miserable likes of ""Big Fat Mamma Blues"" and ""Lonesome Home Blues"" fill in the blanks. I saved serious bucks by purchasing this iteration as a download. It also includes a posthumously electrified band version of ""Canned Heat Blues"" designated ""an abomination"" by the one blues aesthete on the interweb to acknowledge its existence. Personally, I welcome it as a hint of what might have been.
"
FALSE,B+,Neon Repairman,Freedy Johnston,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16555,"
His best collection of songs in this century--clever in the service of a pensive compassion, the major exception being the guy who just kept driving when the cops caught up with that crazy gal Angeline. Feel the unadorned forlorn of ""Baby, Baby Come Home."" Hear how thin-shoed and pregnant outgrows her ""Summer Clothes."" Meet the veteran who didn't get blown up with his buddies but will you sign for this please because he left his hands back in that gutter. Not many dynamics--Can You Fly? is funky by comparison. But a lot of feeling and enough tune.

It does tend schlocky, like so much of what Peter Gabriel's world music label puts out. Yet as someone with no use for Martin Denny or Jean Michel Jarr������������������ or for that matter Junoon, I get undifferentiated pleasure from this two-disc best-of by Haroon and Farook Shamsher, Indian-Bangladeshi brothers who came of age mastering '80s sampling and beatmaking skills in their flautist father's East End instrument shop. The Orientalisms they mix in are fresh enough to engage not just gullible U.K. ravers but an openminded outsider like yours truly; their trance grooves don't go for that overbearing Ibiza-style attack. Try t""We Need Your Vote"" segueing into the hyperactive tablas, reassuring sitars, and female ululations of ""My Love."" Not everything here is up to that standard. But it's a fair taste.

FALSE,B+,Jo Jo Gunne,Jo Jo Gunne,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11719,"
A hard rock band that digs structure and texture as well as drumming and amplification. Vaguely reminiscent of Layla and Detroit, this also derives from the best of Spirit--namely, ""I've Got a Line on You."" Hi-high, American pie.

FALSE,B+,Pop 'N' Mento,The Jolly Boys,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5091,"
No matter what it says on the back, mento isn't roots' roots--it's secondhand calypso that's been tourist music since Harry Belafonte was a folkie. It's also good dirty fun. Tourist Jules Shear couldn't resist Allan Swymmer's nonchalant vocals or Moses Deans's laggardly banjo, and did the world a turn by getting them down.
"
FALSE,B+,J Is for Jump,Jo Mama,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7147,"
A weird one. This is one of those bands that wants to shove its idea of ""good music"" down the audience's collective throat, and I think most rock and rollers will find the style cute and constricted. But me, I enjoy it, on this album. Danny Kootch's songs are wry, just the way I like 'em, and even the phony cocktail jazz ditty framed by the pseudo-Chick Corea piano excavations sounds good. And though the subtle sexuality that pervades the record is hardly original--vocalist Abigale Haness's stuff goes back to June Christie at least--it still turns me on. So this is recommended to my soul/brain/gonad siblings, with the added warning that it doesn't jump much.

FALSE,B+,The Best of George Jones,George Jones,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7148,"
Don't take the title too seriously--the clenched jaw and rubberband larynx of honky-tonk's greatest honky have graced more albums than he can count (seventy, eighty, like that), and only the Lord knows how many singles he's put out. This is a fairly nondescript selection of ten of them, including one B side and two I can't trace. As usual, the highest-charted are the blandest, and neither of my faves--the hyperextended deception trope ""Tell Me My Lying Eyes Are Wrong"" and the poor white ""Where Grass Won't Grow""--made top ten country.
"
FALSE,B+,The Best of George Jones,George Jones,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7150,"
You can hear why people say Billy Sherrill has compromised Jones on this compilation's only great song, ""The Door""; Bergen White's strings begin tersely enough, but by the end the usual army of interlopers is sawing away, so that you barely notice how Jones lowers the boom on the two ""the""s in the song's final line. Ultimately, though, it isn't the production that makes this acceptable but less than scintillating--it's the conception. Too many of these songs lay out the conventional romantic themes with a slight twist, and there's virtually no room for Jones the honky-tonk crazy, the one who sang ""The Race Is On"" and ""No Money in This Deal."" One Epic cut that would help on both counts is the unsarcastic ""You're Looking at a Happy Man,"" in which his wife leaves him.
"
FALSE,B+,Still the Same Ole Me,George Jones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5092,"
Dumb title, appropriately enough, and every word true--just like his lies about lifetime troth in the title number, one of those inane stick-to-the-medulla-oblongata tunes no one will ever do better. And side-openers, the man has side-openers--a brand-new honky-tonk classic and a brand-new wages-of-honky-tonk classic. Nothing else stands out except for the intrusion of young Georgette Jones (Wynette?) (surely not Richey?) on ""Daddy Come Home,"" which even George can't get away with. But it all stands up.
"
FALSE,B+,One Woman Man,George Jones,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5099,"
Less than no way to tell this is his best album since I Am What I Am nine years ago--Billy Sherrill himself doesn't know, not with two cuts previously released and one of those nothing special. The other, however, is the homicidal ""Radio Lover,"" which I first heard on the makeshift By Request. Points of interest include veteran honky-tonk, shameless tearjerk, and the impossible ""Ya Ba Da Ba Do (So Are You),"" about three icons sitting around talking--Elvis Presley, Fred Flintstone, and George Jones.

FALSE,B+,Warm Leatherette,Grace Jones,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1420,"
When Jean-Paul Goude's chocolate-covered s&amp;m fantasy hit the discos in 1977, she seemed more ""Pretty Vacant"" than ""Send in the Clowns,"" and with DOR taking over the dance floors she admits it, moving in on the unoccupied title tune and taking it from there. With Smokey Robinson and Chrissie Hynde scripting adventures in dominance and fellow Jamaicans Shakespeare and Dunbar adding cyborgian oomph, the theoretical allure of her persona is finally made flesh. I just want to know why Barry Reynolds didn't give ""Bullshit"" to Marianne Faithfull.

FALSE,B+,Living My Life,Grace Jones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1422,"
I still don't know why people get hot and bothered about Jones's statuesque if not motionless voice, but that sure is one great disco band, and each album edges her a little closer to her material. ""Everybody Hold Still,"" about getting mugged, moves the New Yorker in me almost as much as Melvin Van Peebles's unblinking urban matin ""The Apple Stretching,"" and three of the five remaining cuts convince me Jean-Paul Goude doesn't know the half of her.
"
FALSE,B+,Inside Story,Grace Jones,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5100,"
This isn't the weirdest album this weirdo has ever made, not with last year's stupid Trevor Horn cut-up in the running. Sometimes it goes too far, as on the religious title cut: ""How great thou art/How great is art."" And beyond the perfect ""I'm Not Perfect (But I'm Perfect for You),"" Bruce Woolley's tunes aren't up to Nile Rodgers's beats or Grace's lyrics. But the beats strike the perfect balance between David Bowie and Diana Ross, and the lyrics--well, ""Chan Hitchhikes to Shanghai,"" ""White Collar Crime,"" ""Barefoot in Beverly Hills""--what kind of disco diva sings about such things? You got it--a weirdo.
"
FALSE,B+,Your Precious Love,Linda Jones,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7156,"
Jones isn't too long on artistry--she likes to dispense with formality and just start at the climax throwing her emotions and her high notes all over material like ""Dancing in the Street"" and ""I Can't Make it Alone."" Pretty amazing, in its way, and definitely recommended to people who always get out of their cars to look at waterfalls and strange rock formations.
"
FALSE,B+,To Be Immortal,"Oran ""Juice"" Jones",1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5106,"
The push here is an anticrack message that's not as fresh or convincing as he pretends, but whatever the man's relationship to cocaine, he's finally confronted his demon--he can't sing. Not a stupid guy, he hits upon a model more within his means than Blue Magic, generating the best Ray Parker Jr. record since ""Ghostbusters"" obviated the original's need for same. Not a nice guy either, he goes for a harder tone, with real live insight into the ""Gangster Attitude"" he knows so well. But the angular studio funk and talky vocals ring the right bells, and the slow ones you can ignore.
"
FALSE,B+,Back on the Block,Quincy Jones,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2853,"
Q's ecumenicism stands as a beacon to the narrow-minded. Jazz, pop, rap, schlock, anonymous divas he's got a piece of, choruses going doo-doo-doo--they're all black music to him. The superrap with Zulu chant is a crossover worthy (also reminiscent) of Michael J., and Kool Moe Dee and Big Daddy Kane's ""Birdland"" lets Joe Zawinul into the canon while setting up a scat connection that further twists the eternal is-rap-bop-or-dozens? debate. As for Barry White, he's done worse. But he's also done better.
"
FALSE,B+,The Joy,The Joy,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4007,"
Maybe freedom from preconceptions has enabled this group, which never achieved its proper impact to begin with, to make the best comeback LP in memory, but more likely it's the quality of the competition. Because basically this is just a good Joy of Cooking album. It probably helps that Terry Garthwaite and Toni Brown now work with black studio musicians--the white ones on Cross-Country did nothing for them, and neither did the hassle of maintaining a band. But this music is about sure-brained songs and an ever richer vocal interplay, just like always, and if Toni's ""You Don't Owe Me Spring"" reminds me never to forget her penchant for limpid soppiness, everything else makes clear that once a rock band defines itself as adult it need never grow old.
"
FALSE,B+,Substance,Joy Division,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1857,"
Where New Order's Substance showcases the trajectory of secret singles specialists, Joy Division's recollects the byways of a natural album band. Starting out as unhysterical punks, they follow their pessimism where it leads, into slower tempos and machinelike rhythms, getting excited only at the end of side one, where enveloped by the dark of night they find their beat and shout out ""Dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio."" They follow that beat where it leads, back down into a pessimism that's now frankly romantic and personal if you've got the sense to hear it that way. And then love tears them apart.

I knew Toni Brown was a folkie, so it shouldn't surprise me that a lot of this is organic bullshit gone to rhythm school--the title of the title cut speaks for itself, and ""Sometimes Like a River"" might also be like a ""Rainbow,"" ""Mountain,"" or ""New Wind"" (adjectival scansion, they call that trick in rhythm school). Depressing to hear somebody who knows as much about male-female as ""The Way You Left"" and ""First Time, Last Time"" apply her creative-writing skills to anti-urban bromides. Graded leniently because I like the way (and how much) Terry Garthwaite sings (and writes).

More English eclecticism in the new orthodox mold: eight vocally oriented cuts with a lot of inventive guitar and rhythm effects and excellent song selection. Listen to side two first. An A minus if the vocal mix weren't so muddy--I don't normally complain about such niceties, but on this lp the lack of clarity is noticable and annoying.

Four years after, you can definitely discern an absence--of faith or community or existential confidence, youth or advance money or raw spiritual health. Where once hooks were a pop luxury their holistic groove had no time for, now the JB's sound as dissociated as some tortured hippie manque or privileged gangsta. So catchier would be nice. Yet they remain unique--street, street-tough, devoid of suburban patina or collegiate pretension, yet somehow free of hostility, blissed out in their blackness. Positive, I guess. And the great stuff--the beats concr��""Blahbludify"" and ""For the Heads at Company Z"" and ""Man Made Material,"" maybe the headlong preclimax of ""JB's Comin' Through"" and ""Spittin Wicked Randomness""--experiments more esoterically the Michaels D or Ivey have ever dared.

J. Morrison's funk is pleasingly plump, replete with pear-shaped tenor, well-rounded rhythms, and thick do-it-yourself mix. He has a sensuous way with a melody, and his romanticism is winningly sincere. But not even the lead cut's tricky be-my-baby hook has that get-up-and-dance kick.

Though the results are more interesting than compelling--not to mention postsignificant, prerevolutionary, better than hip-hop, and whatever else Britcrits claim--the drum-machine cut-and-paste of these white rappers cum dance-music guerrillas definitely deserves its footnote in the annals of sampling. Announcing themselves with ""All You Need Is Love"" as AIDS protest, they rob the BBC, rip off hunks of Sly, kidnap Whitney Houston, construct the ultimate Eurodisco homage, and do whatever else they can to give copyright lawyers apoplexy. Of enduring artistic originality and importance for sure, judge.

I was put off at first by the indifference to sales claimed in the booklet that accompanies this. Such smug anticommercialism usually betrays mixed motives in a purportedly political artist, and I associated this smugness with Kahn's willfully austere Appalachian music. But the songs soon shone through, correctives every one (despite an occasional baldness of instructional intent) to the romanticizations of Southern pastoral individualism that are currently so profitable. Kahn is an aficionado of poor-white virtues, but not at the expense of his vivid understanding of the labor, sadness, frustration, and small-mindedness that go along with them.

Guitarist Dragan Ristic is a Serbian Roma impresario-bandleader-propagandist whose preservationism is proudly mongrel in the great Roma tradition. Where Kal's 2006 debut was beefed up by guest instrumentalists and vocalists, the follow-up showcases Ristic's seven-piece ""Rock'n'Roma"" touring unit, which is less full, but peppier. I'll take the tradeoff--try sitting still for the kickoff ""Krasnokalipsa,"" the DNA-altering ""Romozom,"" or the bitter-in-translation ""Ding Deng Dong."" But I could use more input from the likes of Serbian rapper Marcelo at the start and Serbian sister Jelena Markovic at the end. And I still wish Ristic sang not just in Romany, Serbian, Spanish, and French, but English, dammit. Hey, over here! We're the superpower! Aren't we?

Where Konono No. 1 play unpolished though by now self-conscious street music, the second band to get its own Congotronics album is a ""cultural"" collective in which five ethnic groups from Congo's strife-torn, diamond-producing Kasai region fuse and spread their traditions. It serves up the distorted buzz Congotronics fans jones for, sonics that are generally raunchy even though the thumb pianos also generate balafon beauty, and five lead singers. The long track lengths and ritualistic vocals are more village than metropolis even though Kinshasa is their home--and also more village than the Afro-indie hipster might prefer. Afro-indie folkies won't care.

Like Senegalese mbalax and Zairean rumba, Antillean zouk has its schlocky tendencies--singing in Creole doesn't get all the French out of your system. So Celluloid's two U.S. Kassav' LPs, both from the early '80s, feature synthesizers and fancy horns and ladies going duh-do-do-do as well as hot polyrhythms and soul/calypso/rumba horns and the occasional catchy theme. Georges Decimus is pretty tuneless, closing one side with a drum piece that won't signify to anyone who doesn't know the difference between ti bwa and Saint Jean (they're both rhythms), and while Kassav' #5 is a lot catchier, I bet greatest hits plucked from the two dozen albums recorded by the band and its many offshoots would be a lot catchier than that. Saved by the schlock-like-it-oughta-be of ""Anki Nou""--a quiet storm that crosses ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" with ""Maggot Brain.""

Keyboard player (and now vocalist) H.W. Casey and bassman Richard Finch made so much moolah for T.K. prexy Henry Stone that he told them they could spend as much as $3150 on their own LP. What they come up with is the real Miami sound--the sensual Latin accents that really are sensual in New Orleans sound altogether more hyped-up here. ""Queen of Clubs"" was a smash in the Queen's clubs, while ""Sound Your Funky Horn"" and ""I'm a Pushover"" have creased America's soul charts, which makes three hooks right here. A weirdo and a sleeper.

I don't know how many KC albums the record lover need own. One may well be enough, but zero is certainly too few. This is less consistent than the second and more predictable than the first, but it's a close question: Casey and Finch are remarkably inventive within their unique little ambit.

The slight shifts in rhythmic and compositional strategy are dubious. But this band is like the Ramones--the hooks sneak up on you. What can I say? Not only do I love the title cut, but I find myself humming everything else on the record--the slow one, the cover version, the one in Spanish.

Though I'm sure I wouldn't be niggling if every composition on this EP had the electric lyricism and admonitory dolor of ""Back to Zero Now,"" Keene's keen Beatle extrapolation falls just on the other side of what a modern man must hope for.

After studying a video featuring a photo of Ms. Keita, abstract renditions of industrial worksites, and the lyrics in big block letters, I realized that I know enough French to follow a title song that goes, ""Gagner l'argent fran���������""--""Earning French money/Isn't easy, isn't easy."" I even learned a new piece of French slang: bosser, which according to About.com means ""to work, slog/slave away."" That's a song-of-the-year candidate pour moi. Unfortunately, the rest of the lyrics are almost exclusively in Bambara, which in the absence of trots renders the album atmospheric by definition--spare and lovely, but not supernally so. Mastermind Nicolas Repac favors trap drums physical or otherwise, kora, and spookily ethnic-once-removed synths. A duet with gruff-voiced ngoni master Adama Coulibaly changes things up at just the right moment.
"
FALSE,B+,Ko-Yan,Salif Keita,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3079,"
Even as an avowed enemy of his nation's caste system, Keita hasn't abandoned his royal responsibilities--he's exhorting Malians, or maybe West Africans, and hoping others will listen. Thus the lack of a lyric sheet is no great loss for world peace. The lead cut on the A, keyed to a Bambara word that means ""at one and the same time life, fortune, power, reputation and the devil,"" and the lead cut on the B, keyed to a Bambara word that ""refers at one and the same time to the King, power, alcohol and drugs,"" would be hard to translate into English not just linguistically but culturally, and except for the bitterly cryptic black protest ""Nou Pas Bouger,"" everything else seems curious international fare. But in compensation, Ko-Yan corrects Soro's melodrama for groove. The music is still very much composed rather than created or spun out. But the production goes lighter on the atmospheric kora colors, the abrupt bursts of horn, the synch-simulated whistles and pans and balafon, with Keita's voice--often in tandem with a strong female chorus that sounds a lot less Hollywood this time--riding the rhythm in a nice compromise with the dance music Keita mastered leading the Ambassadeurs. And in the end this fusion may teach non-Malians as much about the complexities of modernization as his lyrics ever could. Anyway, isn't it pretty to think so?
"

One of Keita's better conceived and executed albums presents a familiar vexation to the world music appreciator: exactly how to relate to a supremely expressive voice singing about we-haven't-the-foggiest. One attraction of beat-driven Afropop is that it runs this question over with a herd of kudu, as in Keita's years with the Ambassadeurs, a dance band and proud of it. Continuing the big man's recent return to Malian instrumentation, musical overseer Kante Manfila rewards connoisseurs of pop arrangement for its own sake--traditional soloists piling on their flourishes at the close of ""M'Bemba,"" accelerating repetitions at the climax of ""Moriba,"" the look-mama-no-synth washes of the one I know translates ""I'm Going to Miss You"" because it's in French rather than Bambara, the hard grooves of ""Kamoukie"" and ""Ladji"" to stir the blood. When Keita tacks on a ""keyboards and programming"" dance remix, it's just one more fillip.

One good thing about disco manufacturers is that they'll try anything.

Moral Majority take note: The Kendalls are a father-daughter duo who sing about adultery. With each other. Granted, they do invoke all the Calvinist cheatin'-song antinomies--heaven or hell, devil or angel, etc. But ultimately they're soft on sin--their upbeat melodies and perky arrangements make infidelity seem about as heavy as a very successful Tupperware party.

You have to concentrate to hear her outcomp Leon Pendarvis on ""Clouds"" or remold the melody of ""So Naughty"" or bop the funk on ""All Night's All Right.""

From rural Thailand, a loose, multigenerational gaggle of musicians play their lively yet quiet and medium-tempo version of something called phin phayuk, a phin being the traditional, long-necked, three-stringed lute they electrify. Why American enthusiasts call the result ""Psych &amp; Funk"" beats me as it always does. I'm beginning to intuit that ""psych"" means any vernacular instrumental music that seems to wander a little and isn't the mysterious and antique ""jazz."" But ""funk,"" well--it's true my wife always guesses that they're from some sub-Saharan place, but the rhythms are both straightforward and more poky than pushy, their trance factor a matter of scale and timbre even when they get tricky. This is probably why phin phayuk has sounded just right at breakfast on three or four occasions. In rural Thailand, it starts parades. In Manhattan, it's wake up and make the tea music.

Reformed high school teacher August Darnell having split with black-sheep bro Stoney Browder, the music thins out--Dr. Buzzard's progressive retro is hard to top, Darnell's naturally sarcastic voice short on bottom. So the not exactly all-embracing ""Calypso Pan-American"" and ""Off the Coast of Me"" neither justify nor transcend their distanced tone (typically, the title tune affects a megaphone filter), while comedy numbers like ""Bogota Affair"" (the effete Creole as cuckold), ""Mr. Softee"" (the effete Creole as limp-dick), and ""Darrio . . .""

To the shocked rumor that label prexy (and former Dr. Buzzard manager) Tommy Mottola forced August Darnell back into the studio for a quick ""Lambada"" stick on, I say the universalism of that great hit is an improvement. In general here a level of imagination that has always exceeded Loudoun Wainwright's, say, has turned slightly shticky. ""I Love Girls"" is a sinuous sample of the album's disco-funk and a proper first panel for the roue-in-the-age-of-AIDS triptych. But it's not liberating, daring, or even surprising. For wit, all Darnell does is show off his vocabulary. The same goes for the true-crime ""Taking the Rap,"" the sexy ""When Lucy Does the Boomerang,"" and so forth--not even Cory Daye or Prince lift off from the pleasure zone. Biggest exception is the prophetic refrain of ""Laughing With Our Backs Against the Wall"": ""What you gonna do when the money runs out?"" Sign with Sony, of course.

Bluesy soul records aren't getting any easier to come by, and who am I to complain about one with the great B.B. King contributing guitar parts? ""It Takes a Young Girl"" and ""Better Lovin' Man,"" which sound like standards that somehow passed me by, more than make up for the clumsy ""Summer in the City"" and the rereremade ""Five Long Years.""

The Crusaders jam, B.B. jives and raps, and the result--give or take some background vocals and a few overworked horn charts--is the topcat equivalent of the kind of wonderful blues-bar album Bruce Iglauer of Alligator has been getting out of less accomplished musicians throughout the '70s.

King's seldom been terrible, and when in 1978 he decided to stop trying for AM ballads and disco crossovers and move on up to nightclub funk he started making good albums again. With songs by Doc &amp; Dr. (Pomus and ace sideman John) and a band anchored by the spectacularly unflappable Pretty Purdie, this is the third time in a row he's topped himself. The voice is no longer exquisite and the licks might as well be copyrighted, but King's standard is classic. Of course, it's also predictable--though the material reprises the timeworn truisms (heavy on party blues and perfidious women) with palpable enthusiasm, only ""Victim"" stands much chance of entering the repertoire. But if this were the first King album you'd ever hear you'd make damn sure it wasn't the last.

The artist's flair for the duet is such that the most arresting solo here comes when B.B. is driven to new heights by his favorite collaborator, the B.B. King Orchestra. And because he doesn't want to give away his come-ons yet (or else doesn't have any), he sounds more comfortable with the men than the gals. But that's not to say the likes of Robert Cray and Etta James and John Lee Hooker aren't extra added attractions. Or that they don't inspire him to focus--which is really all he needs.

This is my kind of exploitation--a commercial gimmick that gets two masters back to their form. An honorable document it is, too, especially Bland's part. King's voice and guitar have both been more searing, the latter within recent memory, and though I'd rather hear him singing familiar old blues than mediocre new pop, the classic material does resist renewal, which is why he and Bland do so much pop these days.

FALSE,B+,King Biscuit Boy,King Biscuit Boy,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7197,"
King Biscuit Boy/Richard Newell is a Canadian Paul Butterfield, which I mean as a compliment, and when he sings lead with producer Allen Toussaint doing backups it's the ultimate white blues fantasy. In reality, though, Newell's high-strung earnestness and virtuoso harmonica can't take this album away from Toussaint, and like so many of Toussaint's albums it's only half great. But since it divides neatly into a side of Toussaint songs (great) and a side of Newell's (passable), this time you can't blame that on the auteur.

FALSE,B+,USA,King Crimson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7203,"
Since the nearness of death was good for this band, I figured a posthumous live album might be even better, and though lyrics and vocals are still pompous annoyances, these musical themes (including the off-the-cuff ""Asbury Park"") are among their best. In Central Park they have no choice but to skip the subtlety and turn it up. The excitement thus generated is more Wagner than Little Richard--this record is a case study in the Europeanness of English heavy metal. But that doesn't mean it's not classic.

FALSE,B+,Aha Shake Heartbreak,Kings of Leon,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12856,"
There's an early-Stones feel here it would be perverse to deny: 12 songs in 36 minutes, each with an indelible identiriff and its own seductive rhythmic shape. Caleb Hollowill's slippery wiles recall Jagger's without grasping Jagger's gift for the pungent phrase. That Hollowill avoids cock-rock clich������������������s hardly means he's come to terms with the jezebels who were driving backsliding Southern boys past their intellectual limits long before Elvis p"
FALSE,B+,Muswell Hillbillies,The Kinks,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7206,"
Because the Kinks Klaque hyped this as a great album when a simple perusal of the lyrics revealed more of the same olde alienation, I overreacted violently, but in an unsentimental retrospect I can hear it, and I do mean hear. Most of its charms are in the casual-to-messy eclecticism with which it revives time-honored effects from the music hall and the mod era and even the mountains, and in the dotty good humor of Ray Davies's singing, which makes you think that maybe--just maybe--he doesn't take the ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"" of the ""20th Century Man"" at face value. But combine those two titles circa 2001 and you're in the court of the Crimson King.
"
FALSE,B+,Everybody's in Showbiz,The Kinks,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7207,"
A few of the new songs here are as strident as anything Ray Davies has done since before he started playing the recluse in London in the late '60s. They're tight; they have a firm beat; they're, you know, rock and roll. Unfortunately, they're still self-pitying--the reformed recluse doth reflect overmuch these days on the travails of the touring superstar. But for only an extra dollar you get a live album worth at least that, featuring the antics of a reborn showman who has turned stage fright into a way of life and thus rendered his self-pity somewhat more palatable.

FALSE,B+,Celluloid Heroes,The Kinks,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7213,"
Them as wants an overview of Ray Davies's RCA period are referred to this upstanding compilation, with eight cuts from the first two RCA albums and four from the four others. Although such unlikely gems as ""Have a Cuppa Tea"" and ""Look a Little on the Sunny Side"" are overlooked for more obvious staples of the Kinks' road-band phase, none of the selections is bad. But they're all, well, obvious--devoid of Davies's saving grace, which is subtlety, eccentricity, some combination in there. Overview: the knack remains and the craft may actually have increased, but the gift has flown.

FALSE,B+,Groupa Kroovy (Blood Type),Kino,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5149,"
Just Russian new wavers, their translated lyrics unobtrusively poetic, alienated by habit, politically aware, resigned. But Victor Tsoi's solidly constructed tunes have a droll charm that's fresh if not new, and to an English speaker, the physical peculiarities of his talky voice, which saunters along as if a low baritone is the natural human pitch, seem made for the offhand gutturals and sardonic rhythms of his native tongue. When his boys ooh-ooh high behind ""It's Our Time, Our Turn!,"" it's as if someone has finally concocted an answer record to ""Back in the U.S.S.R.""

FALSE,B+,License to Dream,Kleeer,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5150,"
I started with side two, where the light funk of ""Get Tough"" got lost (soulful John Wayne impression and all) between the inspirational title cut (""Speculate positivity don't turn around"") and the smarmy slow one. Turns out there's a light funk tour de force on the A--a mild one, but that's the only way they come. Highlights: ""Running Back to You""'s congas-and-timbales interweave, ""Hypnotized""'s Latin accent, and the sexy slow one.

FALSE,B+,Rhythm and Jews,The Klezmatics,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3680,"
Although neither band is especially pure, and a good thing too, what distinguishes their shtick from that of the Klezmer Conservatory Band, who I enjoy from a respectful distance, is that it honors the shtetl rather than the borscht belt. Their sense of drama precedes vaudeville and, more significantly, musical comedy.
"
FALSE,B+,Apikorsim/Heretics,The Klezmatics,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17000,"
The definitive modern klezmer band's first album of new originals in well over a decade finds them as lovely and lively as ever, with Lorin Sklamberg's tenor plenty pliant in his sixties. Note, however, that it's entirely in Yiddish. I can attest from the booklet that the lyrics bite, uplift, and amuse in translation if you read along. But I advise that you ascertain what you get musically from tracks four-five-six--in English, the frolicsome ""Party in Odessa"" to the bereft ""Dark Is the Night"" to the defiant ""Heretics"" itself. If suitably entranced or intrigued, buy the CD with its cheat sheet. If not, play Possessed again and proceed with your life.

FALSE,B+,UAIOE,KMFDM,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1946,"
In both reggae and rock modes, this twisted Belgian dance band is groovier than the noise norm--positively sinuous sometimes, especially on the pick-to-click ""Murder."" Guest vocalists--metal heldentenor, spliffed-up toaster--add personality, risking the verboten corn. Yet the product emerges unscathed. Dare to struggle, dare to win.

FALSE,B+,Enough Rope,Chris Knight,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13394,"
From the ex-hellion drinking ice tea in his yard to the city laborer who'd rather work his job than wear chains like his cousin Willie, this is where the Kentucky storyteller gets off the outlaw romanticism train, which turned into a Trailways bus years ago. ""Old Man"" deserves to be programmed back to back with John Prine, ""Dirt"" with Freedy Johnston. Still, put him head to head with those guys on the wrong Saturday night and he might still be inclined to kick both their asses.

FALSE,B+,I Feel a Song,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7224,"
Compared to sisters like Aretha Franklin or Tina Turner, Knight is a moderate. Her way with a ballad is suspiciously smooth and direct, and her demeanor flirts with the respectable. But she always radiates a great singer's luminous conviction, and beneath the moderation she's very comfortable with her emotional extremities. When she adds a squeal or a grunt or a growl on this album, or holds back a tear, or turns a song into a trembling sigh, you know she means exactly what she isn't saying, and I've never heard her in better voice. The material is still a little flat, but it does take in uptempo soul and Dionne Warwick pop and Bill Withers funk and Bill Withers sentiment. Plus a version of ""The Way We Were"" that establishes her claim to a middle-class veneer in perpetuity.

FALSE,B+,The Best of Gladys Knight & the Pips,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7226,"

"
FALSE,B+,All Our Love,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5155,"
The CD-era duration does indulge Knight's middle-class vices. At twenty-eight minutes for six songs that are longer on melodrama than break beats, the second side is like a suburban living room that seems overfurnished even though all the pieces are in the best contemporary taste. But Knight has one of those burgundy voices, designed to age, and since her albums have rarely done it justice, the edgy writing and overall strength of this multiproducer soul-dance-pop-whatever comeback is a gift.

FALSE,B+,Close-Up,Bonnie Koloc,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7233,"
This is where Koloc's modest, unmistakable intelligence--and voice--finally make a record work. Not that the old problems don't persist--I disapprove of songs about silver stallions, I'm sick of ""We Had It All,"" and I guarantee that Koloc's own unaccompanied ""I'll Still Be Loving You"" requires more camouflage than her Marxophone (?) coda. But the two Lil Green compositions that kick off side two vie with the originals and would set the right tone even if they didn't. She does all right by Hank Snow's ""Rhumba Boogie,"" too.

FALSE,B+,Africanism,Kongas,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7235,"
This Cerrone-Don Ray concept group is the most convincing rock-disco fusion to date. The 15:21-minute A side sustains the propulsion of ""Gimme Some Lovin'"" for twelve-and-a-half minutes longer than Spencer Davis and Stevie Winwood did, proving (despite one dumb pseudo-seduction interlude) that Stevie's organ roll did more to keep the song going than his famous vocal.

FALSE,B+,51,Kool A.D.,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15825,"
Heems's Das Racist partner favors skinnier, more electro beats, most by his Bay Area compadre Amaze 88, which he loops under raps that carry more weight on this April mixtape than they did on The Palm Wine Drinkard just a few months before--as do the cameos from Mr. Rogers and a chipmunked Huey P. Newton. True, the record shudders to a virtual halt when the ecumenical auteur turns beatmaker midway through, and some may judge the rhymes irresponsibly playful. But he's right about ""Yo these girls are smart man/I'm trying to figure out how to play my part man/I don't know how to start man/The strangest organ is the human heart man/Fuck with shortcuts like I'm Robert Altman/Fuck with long shots like I'm Robert Altman/Fuck with actresses like I'm Robert Altman/Recycled like half a verse but that's art man.""

From the beatless two-finger-piano-plus-sine-wave opener to the minimalist-piano-plus-brushes closer, you'll believe Victor Vazquez is deploying the weirder half of the sessions from which he'll construct two albums. The beats are funkier but never aggressively danceable--synth whistles, skeletal syndrum snatches, organ parts, sandpaper vinyl noise. And the raps are in Spanish and French as well as English, as befits a guy who claims Michael Ondaatje, believes Leonard Maltin and Rick Ross belong in successive 16s, and leads his own prayer circle.

FALSE,B+,Road to the Riches,Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5162,"
From nasty piano steal to harp hook to bicycle horn to layered ear-scrape to Gary Numan cover to Memphis blues again, this is Marley Marl at his most encyclopedic, and G's fast, harsh lisp is straight outta Queensbridge. But there's too much boast, too much money, too much gaydissing no matter how ridiculous. I don't think G is obliged to transcend a spiritual trap he never made. But until he does he'll have to be a genius, not just the new hard on the block, to escape his ghetto.

FALSE,B+,Knowledge Is King,Kool Moe Dee,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1956,"
His beats grander, his samples funkier, his cadences harder, Moe Dee not only ain't no joke, he's lost his sense of humor. He's feeling his age, has something to prove: all that gladiatorial imagery sounds pretty defensive. With help from Teddy Riley, his natural swing puts the first set of boasts across anyway, but on the B, only the magnificent ""Pump Your Fist"" (attention, JDO: he has the chutzpah to call the Middle Passage a ""Holocaust"") shows the kind of knowledge that is power or vice versa.

This safe, sane 15-track summation is sufficient to the old-school veritas of Mohandas Dewese's declaratory beat. It don't stop, and it don't stop. But on his first two albums, and more explicitly if less consistently later, he was also a bridge to the conscious rap that made the old school seem so elementary. How ya like him now depends on how well ya knew him back when.

Volume 2 not for the artist, but for his label's new catalogue exploitation; nine of the 12 tracks also appear on Moe Dee's 1994 best-of, with which it shares its inferiority to his first two solo albums. But the three additions--""Knowledge Is King,"" ""Funke Wisdom,"" ""The Avenue""--show off his brainy independence. Both comps fulfill their destiny. This one goes in the changer.

I know, what could be worse than a sci-fi concept album by Al Kooper, who hasn't been good for a whole LP since early electric Dylan? Only it's really solid, without one bad cut. Kooper's melodies stick to the ribs, and his lyrics are adequate or better, and does he do a job on some oldies from Curtis Mayfield and Smokey Robinson. Recommended.

They say this self-contained Jamaican sextet returns reggae to harmony-group truths, but with Rueben Espuet's falsetto teasing the cover versions till they giggle and Sly &amp; Robbie exploding those beats, their traditionalism sounds pretty pomo to me. Material includes Sarah Vaughan's ""Broken Hearted Melody,"" three Smokey Robinson songs (one credited to ""Unknown""), and a twisted six-minute ""Tequila"" bent further out of shape by samples from ""Pump Up the Volume"" and The Marriage of Figaro.

At 65, the guy ""who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways &amp; firetrucks, not even one free beer"" (that's from ""Howl,"" kids) survives as the great American bohemian. Yeah, he was in a rock and roll band (the Fugs, kids), but pure bohos rarely gravitate toward such large-scale forms. Tuli prefers found photographs, newspaper clippings, stick figures, new lyrics for famous tunes--the best stuff on his legendary 1968 ESP-Disk spoken-word was want ads. So I grant that this excessively long-awaited follow-up is of specialized interest. Still, music-lovers should hear ""Evolution,"" dictated from the other side by John himself; ""Swami"" (""How I love you how I love you/Swami Everykinanda""); ""Way Down South in Greenwich Village,"" an updated '20s classic with ukulele impression; and, no joke, ""Morning, Morning,"" a song about life and death and their fleeting beauty that deserves eternal salvation.

FALSE,B+,Original Sufferhead,Fela Anikulapo Kuti,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4777,"
The musical definition is so sharp it's hooky, with arresting commentary from a backup chorus that includes many of the leader's wives. And the lyrics help, especially ""Power Show""'s bitter observations in re bureaucratic status-tripping. The title (and other) track, in his geopolitical mode, makes its point less cleanly.

Like all groove artists, Fela benefits mightily from marginal differentiation, which on this 1977 outing with Afrika 70 is provided by the blats, splats, and tuneful snatches of Lester Bowie's trumpet. The 15:36 title side is distinguished from its 15:48 companion by a few minutes of Fela mouthing off and a catchier keystone ostinato.

Fears that imprisonment has turned him into a shell can be put aside, and by tacking twelve- and fourteen-minute instrumentals in front of fourteen- and eighteen-minute songs Wally Badarou goes a long way toward solving the man's record-making problem. At half an hour apiece, his grooves have time to prove themselves, and the vinyl sound is bright enough if you pump up the volume a little. As for message, the lyrics are certainly touched by his incarceration, but his pan-Africanism seems unchanged: it's as limited, as scathing, and as justifiable as ever.

Emerging from a groove that maintains, the find is the sole non-title cut. Called ""Power Show,"" it's nothing of the sort. It may not be thoughtful--Fela always reacted more than he reflected. But the laid-back bpms and sour sax make thinking sound like a good thing.

Seated in red suit and executive chair on the cover, the buxom Jamaican blond sprawls on a striped couch in halter and who-knows-what? inside--who knows because her hands cover her split beaver and the CD hole covers her hands. It's the new slackness, confidently and voraciously refusing to become the last big thing. Cribbing ""That's Amore"" and a generic country tune and a properly credited ""Love Is Strange,"" ranging riddimically from something we call oompah to something she calls joy ride, she sings about sex while never confusing power and pleasure or sounding beholden to anyone but herself. Do I like it raw? Well, since you were nice enough to ask . . .

Though it's worse than ridiculous for Grammy tastemongers to classify these slick professionals as folk musicians, they are exotics, subject to foreign pop's law of diminishing returns--after you get past how different it is, you're stuck with differentiating it from itself. So, a couple of hints. One, this is a harmony album; Joseph Shabalala isn't submerged, but he isn't showcased either. That makes for a nice little change. Two, it's a religious album, replete with full translations and 12 ways to sing amen. That one I'm not so sure about.

Transcriptions from the Zulu help the student trace the intricate structures in 48-track detail.

Absolute masters of a self-invented formula neither they nor their fans ever weary of, Ladysmith are like the Ramones at a higher level of musical if not philosophical development.

Never long on personality, these cogs in Dick Griffey's machine can at least muster a consistent compilation (unlike such rival pros as Atlantic Starr, say). Among their eleven years' worth of occasional hits, only one post-'84, are their signature dress-up number ""Fantastic Voyage,"" ""It's All the Way Live""'s primitive forerunner of the ""Good Times"" bassline, and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" as a moderately personable slow one.

The Dr. Dre-anointed Lamar isn't a guy who writes a lot of indelible songs yet, especially if you try to find them toward the top of his much-praised second album. Thus he's liable to leave the curious wondering what the fuss is about. But as I re-relistened I noticed myself perking up with every hook. Not that every track has or wants one, but that, for instance, the sung intros to the cosmetics debate ""No Make-Up (Her Vice),"" track four, and then the crack generation shout-out ""Ronald Reagan Era,"" track seven, come as well-timed structural respites from his thoughtfully private to defensively street raps, which have their musicality too. And then, just when you're thinking not bad at all, come some songs.

Although singles are country's lifeblood, this Nashville chartbuster has been popular music's most consistent album artist for nearly a decade--four solo plus two by the triple-threat Pistol Annies. But on this double-CD, one subtitled ""Nerve"" and the other ""Heart,"" she overreaches, sells herself short, or both--particularly, surprise surprise, on the ""Heart"" disc. Maybe she wants to prove something to her ex Blake Shelton, who I doubt is smart enough to justify the effort. Or maybe she just wants to convince herself she's worthy of a schmaltzfest like ""Tin Man"": ""If you ever felt one breakin'/You wouldn't want a heart."" Needless to say, I greatly prefer the album's sole solo composition, her current hit ""We Can Be Friends""--rude couplets like ""If you use alcohol as a sedative/And 'bless your heart' as a negative"" are why I'll love her forever. But it would be sexist to insist she be all feisty all the time, and a co-write with Pistol Annie Ashley Monroe called ""Use My Heart"" is the love song that proves it--by pondering whether Lambert lacks the ""nerve"" for love. Here's hoping she learns how to put the two together. She deserves it and we need it.

Whether moved by the propinquity of their own folk tradition or by some general attraction to the eccentric, English rockers are at ease with a sprightly sloppiness that is usually left to folkies in the U.S.--they know it's rarely enough to be ""tight."" On this solo debut Lane takes the Faces--not the Faces themselves, but their hang-loose playfulness--into the English countryside with saxophone, tambourines, an accordion, and a choir of communards. Whether undergoing his own reincarnation on ""Stone"" or coming on randy and rude in ""Ain't No Lady,"" he sounds sweet and independent; he covers Fats Domino and Chuck Berry and ""Brother Can You Spare a Dime.""

Formally, this is reactionary, from Lane's chesty melismas to the band's fakebook licks, and the songs go on too long. But every one catches, and despite Lane's lady-macho stage moves, her lyrics seem felt in what I can only call a progressive way--autonomous but not anomic or selfish, compassionate but not infinitely longsuffering.

Finally she swells with the contained enthusiasm of Tracy Nelson Country 20 years ago, back when authenticity wasn't such a vexed concept. Willie Nelson's ""Three Days"" and Wynn Stewart's ""Big Big Love"" do stand out, but not so's they embarrass Lang's originals, most of which are pretty metaphysical for country music. They're just highlights, like her own lusty ""Big Boned Gal"" and her own metaphysical ""Luck in My Eyes."" And ""Nowhere to Stand"" is an even smarter (and more abstract, fancy that) battered-child song than Suzanne Vega's or Natalie Merchant's. Maybe it's out of place on a quasiauthentic country record, though you have to like how she sneaks in the phrase ""family tradition."" But vexed concepts cut two ways.

After that, fittingly but dishearteningly (although under the circumstances that's fitting too), the songcraft wends its way gradually downhill; not even the title track provides much of a rise. Only then comes a finale called ""Strange Ways to Win Wars"" and Langford is on top of things again--not young because he's not that kind of liar, just strong and clear-eyed as he quietly and suggestively surveys our disheartening politics: ""And no one is spared, no one is spared/No one is spared, no one is spared.""

LaSalle seems to be a songwriter first and a singer second, which may be why there's a certain professional anonymity about her unusual moods. But the voice is there--sensual, warm, even wise, ideal for Willie Mitchell's meditative Memphis funk. And because she's a pretty good songwriter, just about every one of these twelve tracks offers its professional pleasures.

FALSE,B+,Rain and Fire,Denise LaSalle,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5346,"
LaSalle earns enough in Malaco's songwriting stable to limit her recording career to a humdrum album every year or two, and since that's all she managed as a perpetual also-ran, there was no reason to hope for serendipity. But here she learns her revenge from the soaps and her tune from George Jackson, throws role model Sylvia Robinson a cover, name-drops all over a toot-toot follow-up, and demonstrates what Millie Jackson might be today if she hadn't put on airs--a teller of truths too raunchy for the country moralists who prime but fail to satisfy her market. Highpoints include the eight-minute saga ""It Be's That Way Sometime"" and dovetailing critiques of the hard-on, ""Dip, Bam, Thank You Ma'am"" and ""It Takes You All Night"" (""To do what you used to do all night""). Plus this Inspirational Verse: ""They can't eat no more, no sir/They got anorexia nervosa.""

Great falsettos like Smokey Robinson and Clyde McPhatter flow uphill, while lesser ones like Maurice Gibb and Russell Thompkins settle for the formal panache and expressive limitation of acknowledged artifice. Lasley certainly doesn't flow, but he doesn't settle, either--his struggle toward full emotional range sounds forced at first, but then willed, which is different. Playing head voice for homosexual angst rather than love-man tenderness or androgynous affect, he sets his colloquial confessions to pristine studio soul backup completely appropriate in a concept album about a white guy in love with black music. But at times it does seem forced.

The artiest love man since Eugene Record wasn't the next Dylan, Lasley adds a wonderful rap for ""queers"" and a terrible street-talk verit������""Euripides Meets the Shangri-Las"" to his straightforward sha-la-la lyrics and Brill Building grooves, with fellow Detroiter Don Was throwing in Linn drums and such. His falsetto has gained color and heft, too.

FALSE,B+,The Noise of Trouble (Live in Tokyo),Last Exit,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1999,"
The return of free jazz was inevitable in this time of '60s nostalgia, and believe me, it could be a lot worse. At least Bill Laswell and Ronald Shannon Jackson revert to rhythm when the path of pure inspiration peters out, and Sonny Sharrock is without sonic peer. Somewhat less imposing is the group's unacknowledged center, West German saxophone legend Peter Br������������������tzmann, but Ornette himself couldn't make consistent music out of a concept that eschews not only heads but rehearsal, and he probably wouldn't want to. Consistency's not the idea--becoming is, and those who'd rather watch childbirth movies may have a point. All three of the group's albums are live. Last Exit documents the blinding headache of their first gig and is often played by Lester Bangs to keep angels and rock critics away. My sentimental favorite is Cass""Big Boss Man,"" because its ""Ma Rainey"" mentions Alexander Pope, and because half of it was recorded in Allentown. But this is the one that actually comes together. The so-called suite kind of is, ""Panzer Be-Bop"" is pure atonal convergence, and Herbie Hancock sticks in his two cents like he knows what for.

FALSE,B+,Hear No Evil,Bill Laswell,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=308,"
Only such a cold bastard could conceive new age so undisgusting. Some hear Another Green World in the thing, and there's that. Also r&amp;b readymades and George Harrison's Wonderwall and packages of free noodles. I swear I can hear him laughing; sometimes I laugh myself. I swear he thinks it's good of its kind, too. So do I.

FALSE,B+,More More More Latimore,Latimore,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7255,"
After last year's covers of ""Take Me to the Pilot,"" ""So Much Love,"" and ""For What It's Worth"" I hoped I'd never run into the fellow again, but here he gets basic. His voice is too ordinary to put any of the three blues up with the Bland, King, or Mabon original. But he likes what he's singing so much that he doesn't have to go for the simulated high emotion of some fancy vocal embellishment--he just puts those lyrics across, intelligent and matter-of-fact, as if you've never heard them before, which maybe you haven't.
"
FALSE,B+,Latimore III,Latimore,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7256,"
Mixing Lou Rawls and Swamp Dogg in a soul-stud groove that climaxes on the fast side with his sympathetic impression of ""a redneck in a soul band"" and is softened on the (less impressive) slow side by a spirited but thoughtful rendition of ""Ladies' Man,"" a song about not getting it up that's probably the best thing Oscar Brown Jr. ever wrote.
"
FALSE,B+,Dig a Little Deeper,Latimore,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7258,"
In seven solid, funk-rooted tunes this obdurate soul holdout portrays, in order, a long-suffering on-the-road monogamist, a stud on the prowl, a reluctant lay (""We got to hit if off before we get it on,"" he tells a ""liberated woman""), a sentimental monogamist, a sex slave, a good lover (title tune), and a seducer of virgins (courtesy Rod Stewart). And convinces in all seven roles. Very impressive. But I don't believe I'll introduce him to my wife.

FALSE,B+,I'll Do Anything for You,Latimore,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5349,"
As T.K. was folding in 1980, this after-the-fact soul hero resorted to L.A. session men to define his seriousness, which proved no less schlocky than most pop seriousness. But his 1982 return to his roots on Malaco was only slightly less schlocky, because at least temporarily the man has lost his knack as a composer. Here the title tune and the first three cuts on side one are the hottest soul tracks of a year that saw as many new soul albums as the previous three or four put together, but it isn't just the Mississippi rhythm section that's catapulted him back into the action. It's also the Memphis songwriting stable. Say thank you to George Jackson and Denise LaSalle.

As I hope his guru tells him, Narada Michael Walden is always better off Helping Others, and who better than this going-on-fourteen cross between Teena Marie and Michael Jackson, whose natural cuteness absorbs the sickly-sweet aftertaste of Walden's jumpy little tunes?

FALSE,B+,Walker County,Eddy Lawrence,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5354,"
A folkie who works in NYC, Lawrence cultivates a pastoral gift for vernacular narrative, as in the Alabama locale of his title and most of his material--lots of red dirt gone to asphalt, farmland gone to housing tract, homes gone to trailers. Sure he veers into sentiment, but only the instrumental is without its turn of phrase.

FALSE,B+,Whiskers and Scales and Other Tall Tales,Eddy Lawrence,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1129,"
You know the routine--local folkie sets down with a couple of stringed instruments and lets fly. It works or it doesn't; usually it doesn't. But Lawrence is showing off so much eye, ear, and imagination that his stories barely require the appearance of music. Try the catfish farmer. Or the Marine's big-talking little brother. Or the bigamous lady trucker with the girlfriend in Wisconsin. Or Tommy's mommy's swami playing hide the salami. He's even moderately funny about fishing.

FALSE,B+,Led Zeppelin III,Led Zeppelin,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2012,"
If the great blues guitarists can make their instruments cry out like human voices, it's only fitting that Robert Plant should make his voice galvanize like an electric guitar. I've always approved theoretically of the formula that pits the untiring freak intensity of that voice against Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs, and here they really whip it into shape. Plant is overpowering even when Page goes to his acoustic, as he does to great effect on several surprisingly folky (not to mention folk bluesy) cuts. No drum solos, either. Heavy.

FALSE,B+,Physical Graffiti,Led Zeppelin,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2015,"
I suppose a group whose specialty is excess should be proud to emerge from a double-LP in one piece. But except on side two--comprising three-only-three Zep classics: ""Houses of the Holy,"" ""Trampled Under Foot,"" and the exotic ""Kashmir""--they do disperse quite a bit, not into filler and throwaway (""Boogie with Stu"" and ""Black Country Woman"" on side four are fab prefabs) but into wide tracks, misconceived opi, and so forth. Jimmy Page cuts it throughout, but after a while Robert Plant begins to grate--and I like him.

FALSE,B+,In Through the Out Door,Led Zeppelin,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2016,"
The tuneful synthesizer pomp on side two confirms my long-held belief that this is a real good art-rock band, and their title for the first ten minutes or so, ""Carouselambra,"" suggests that they find this as humorous as I do. The lollapalooza hooks on the first side confirms the world's long-held belief that this is a real good hard rock band. Lax in the lyrics department, as usual, but their best since Houses of the Holy.

They really were pretty great, and these eight outtakes--three from their elephantine blues phase, three from their unintentional swan song--aren't where to start discovering why. But despite the calculated clumsiness of the beginnings and the incomplete orchestrations of the end, everything here but the John Bonham Drum Orchestra would convince a disinterested party--a Martian, say. Jimmy Page provides a protean solo on ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" and jumbo riffs throughout.
"
FALSE,B+,Laura Lee,Laura Lee,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7263,"
The original title was Two Sides of Laura Lee, which went the way of the ""Empty Bed Blues"" promised on the jacket but still sums up the idea: soften up that man-hating persona. It succeeds, too, with songs from the Honey Cone's production team that give Lee, a gritty singer who can't match the power of a Millie Jackson or the spunk of an Ann Peebles, a chance to show off the recitatives at which she excels--I'm especially fond of ""At Last,"" where Lee falls for a nice boy. But the prize is on the ""other"" side--""Rip Off,"" the real follow-up to ""Women's Love Rights,"" which I'll bet was boycotted by male program directors because it was about property as well as sex.

FALSE,B+,Death of Innocence,Legal Weapon,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5358,"
Since like so much L.A. gothic this punk metal cultivates melodrama with an enthusiasm that could be campier, I don't quite know how to take Kat Arthur's tales of young woe. If she really did get sodomized by daddy on the floor, the hooky crudity of her response is guts ball. But if she just thought incest a fitting hook for such a crude grabber of a riff, she should have thought some more. And the strain of such distinctions renders the crudity less satisfying than its hooks warrant.
"
FALSE,B+,Your Weapon,Legal Weapon,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5359,"
The follow-up is less unrelenting, but it's also subtler in crucial little ways--tempo change here, Byrdsy decoration there, burr in the throat all over the place. Kat Arthur may well be turning into Joan Jett with something to say and something else to say it with. She's still young and she still means it, but she's gained perspective on her bombed-out blues.

On her debut, the masked marvel keeps things simple, showing off her stuff in an impressive assortment of what are more chants, jingles, and ditties than songs. After all, what bizzer in his or her right mind would say no to a young nobody who sneaks the assonant ""Ski mask under my hijab"" into her opening track? Next she's late to work because that Juvenile song she loves comes on. ""Money""--""Not the cemetery / Or the penitentuary""--is followed by ""M I L K,"" which is not to be pronounced ""milk."" Attend also to the ragga ""Bubblegum"" and the area-code-literate ""Ho.""

It would be silly to insist that there's much musical magnetism in the archly received/sampled arrangements or sad-sack delivery of this young Swede's official debut album. But it would be stupid not to want to hear the lyrics again--and again. ""Yeah I got busted/So I used my one phone call to dedicate a song to you on the radio""? Quiet yet audacious. ""When I said I wanted to be your dog/I wasn't coming on to you/I just wanted to lick your face""? You can't argue with that. ""Lick those raindrops from the rainy day/You can take me for a walk in the park""? But that doesn't mean he can't top it.

Lema knows too much keyboard. Orchestrating for drama and structure, he ends up with a music of brilliant passages--now Ellingtonian, now almost Brazilian. If you equate Zaire with the eternal groove you'll find him irritating. But if you get your kicks contemplating rhythms as well as consuming them, try this rooted fusion of soukous, funk, reggae, mbaqanga, rock, fusion, and whatever--complete with shrewd, languid vocals of equal intelligence, or wisdom.

Eleven shots in the dark from the weirdest major rock and roller of the early '70s. All the hits are here, many of them misses, with the number-one single as out of place as ""Happy Xmas"" and ""Woman Is the Nigger of the World."" Not just because it's bad, either--in retrospect, ""Whatever Gets You Through the Night"" and ""Power to the People"" sound equally bald, equally stupid. Not counting the two available on must-own albums, the only great cuts are ""Instant Karma"" (Lennon's best political song) and ""#9 Dream"" (catchier nonsense pop than McCartney's ever managed). So I don't play it much. But I'm sure glad it's on the shelf.

The late-night session-band workups of songs later embalmed on Walls and Bridges are startlingly stark and clear, making side two the finest music of the hiatus between Imagine and Double Fantasy, whose precisely felt studio-rock they prefigure. Phil Spector produced the commercial versions. He also produced Rock 'n' Roll, source of the outtakes on side one, which were rejected because they're even stiffer than the intakes. John never could figure out what to do about loving Rosie &amp; the Originals. And Phil wasn't the guy to tell him.

With Texophiles buzzing these guys up as the roadhouse band of a college cowboy's dreams, I was put off some--that big, brawling sound has never been this honorary pencilneck's idea of Saturday night.

Gyrating second vocalist Joe Doerr joins the Texas quartet whose neoroadhouse album went cult last year. The kid sings like he only masturbates twice a day because his boner makes it impossible for him to walk to his car, adding a memorable rockabilly urgency to ""Treat Her Right"" that puts the manly confessional boasts ""Ain't I'm a Dog"" and ""D.W.I."" in suitably adolescent perspective.

These anthemic Parisian punks are all form and no conviction, except for the conviction that form is everything. And despite the always uncharismatic and often choral vocals, this suffices. The proximate source is probably PiL--if ""Papapapa"" isn't their ""Poptones,"" my name is Jah Wobble. But because they mean to be inspirational, even uplifting, they also evoke the Buzzcocks, not to mention Brian Eno (not to mention 999). Trust the French to do neoclassicism right.

After a 34-minute art project that ended up a great album, a 17-minute EP ends up an art project. ""Get Off the Internet"" was overdue and ""They want us to make a symphony out of the sound of women swallowing their own tongues"" does us the honor of taking its title literally. But don't be so sure either will hold up like ""Gone b4 yr home."" Male chauvinist boyfriends are eternal.

You said it, the man's an utter cornball, but on this album I simply succumb to the stupid pleasures of his big fat rockcraft. Even though I know it isn't the ""same old back beat"" that keeps rock and roll alive, but rather musicians brave or bored enough to fuck with it, something same-old has me grunting with pleasure at that song every time I let down my guard. No guard required: ""I Want a New Drug"" (recreational), ""Bad Is Bad"" (bad), and ""Walking on a Thin Line"" (when are Vietnam Veterans Against the War putting together their compilation album?).

Late great New York bohemian Kupferberg loved ""parodies,"" which originally just meant songs that set new lyrics to old tunes: the more erotic than fetishistic ""I Want to Hold Your Foot,"" say, or ""This Train Is Bound for Brooklyn,"" as in ""This train is bound for Brighton / If you wanna go to Bay Ridge you're not on the right one."" But he also wrote the enraptured Fugs threnody ""Morning Morning,"" covered by such worthies as Joan Baez and Spyder Turner but done just as right by the living-room sing-along Lewis convened for this album. This approach has its limitations, but gets the job done. Try ""What Are You Doing After the Orgy?,"" melodicized by Lewis from a Kupferberg notebook, which dreams of extracting friendship from orgasm. Try ""Life Is Strange,"" where an aged heir of Aristide Bruant reports he's perfectly OK with never having once seen Paris.

FALSE,B+,Acid Tongue,Jenny Lewis,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14196,"
Like so many solo statements, this one's awash in freedom of choice--string section on demand, a drummer who knows her place, arrangements jenny-rigged beneath verses that could use a groove, and three male notables, including Elvis Costello himself. Only a talent as major as Lewis could half bring it off. But note that it's Rilo Kiley's Jason Boesel whose drums set off the lazy ""See Fernando,"" about a secular saint who'll always buy a sinner a beer, and the wicked ""Carpetbaggers"", about dirty-booted jezebels tricking innocent young things into helping with the groceries. With Boesel helping, the nine-minute ""The Next Messiah"" may well convince you that her dad or someone like him was a power-mad con artist. But he fails to deliver ""Jack Killed Mom"" from the skeptical scrutiny due all songs on oedipal themes since the Doors' ""The End.""

The hardest-rocking Lewis album in years and the best London-meets-the-legend promotion since Howlin' Wolf's is amazingly consistent and authoritative--Lewis's patented hick cool always provides its satisfactions. But the impersonality of the no-gaffe two-disc supersession encourages his habit of expressing compassion and pain without any show of conviction. Of course, that's part of his charm. And you've gotta hear Rory Gallagher take Elmore James's part on ""Whole Lotta Shakin'.""

Fans of monopoly capital will please explain how this belated subclassic of hortatory soul could happen anywhere but on a Southern indie label.

These would-be ingenues rarely go all the way. They don't always sing flat, but they always make you nervous about it, and both their consciousness and their English are pretty rudimentary for kin of Fela and Soyinka. Not nonexistent, however--unlikely as their guileless vocal affect makes it seem, how can a song that goes ""We're cashing in prostitution yeah/Cashing in revolution yah"" be anything but bitterly ironic? (Right??) This best-of isn't everything it might be--Mother Africa's ""Iya Mi Jowi"" would spruce it up substantially, for instance. But with producer Biddy Wright hooking them up, it's a minor girlpop treasure with a considerable difference.

There was apparently a Shanachie best-of I never heard back in '84, but in this heyday of obscurantist crate-digging, now the entire four-album catalogue of these beauteous second cousins of Fela and Wole Soyinka will be released over a one-year span. The debut was Danger and it's lame, English-language moralism further weakening wan attempts at the pop equanimity the Shirelles and lesser females achieved so sweetly so long before. On this follow-up, though, the sustaining grooves the title half-promises buoy gentle soprano harmonies attached to messages I know enough not to be curious about. Instead there are the thrumming pressure drums, the clarinet obbligato that could be a soprano sax obbligato, the guitar solo that could be a synth solo, the spoken praise of the moon delivered by multi-instrumental mastermind Biddy Wright. All of which, I suspect, could be readily accommodated by a new best-of that also isolated a keeper on Danger itself.

Formerly Kleenex has kept the faith even though only the lead cuts pack the goofy punch of ""Split""'s massed whistles and saxophones, or the chaotic rallying cry ""Eisiger Wind""--not to mention ""U,"" or ""You,"" or ""Ain't You."" Where the Slits aspire to Mango and the Raincoats to ECM and the Au Pairs to Grunt, these women clearly belong with the rest of Rough Trade's amateur anarchohumanists; they're the best thing to happen to Switzerland since John Berger. In another context I might disapprove of the clumsy white funk toward which their instrumental atmosphere has evolved, or fret about just what their references to ichor, stilts, and kicking heels mean. But this music combines the spirit of a kindergarten rhythm band with the sophistication of a wartime art school, just like the real Cabaret Voltaire.

Ry Cooder). Does only passably by the golden oldies (compare ye golde Everlys, Tempts, Isleys/Beatles), comes up with middling-to-good ""originals"" (by one Bob ""Frizz"" Fuller except for the aptly titled ""Pay the Man""), and knocks you dead with the obscure covers (cf.

The problem with Lowell George isn't so much that he doesn't write good songs as that he doesn't write great ones. He's immersed in blues--it's his idiom. But his own boast to the contrary, ""eloquent profanity"" doesn't come easy to him, and it should--in a real blues artist, the secret of a simple trope like ""Two Trains"" is that it seems spontaneous and conventional both at once, while George's clenched throat and staggering slide bear witness to his creative effort. None of which is to say that these aren't good songs--when George finds the right trope (or when Bill Payne finds a piano part like the one that hooks the title cut) the strain is part of the fun.

From the daring little piano hook of ""I Can Give You More"" to Russell Simmons's motormouth prevarications on ""That's a Lie"" to the humble love-man details of ""I Want You,"" this is the most engaging and original rap album of the year. But the post-Run-D.M.C. school does betray a penchant for what you might call bourgeois individualism. Laying off messages is one thing, but the Hollis crew rarely projects much community or solidarity either. Which sometimes leaves a solo artist alone with his DJ and his fine self.

Lloyd really has his pop down, and this record never fails to cheer me when it comes on--the songwriting and guitar textures are consistently tuneful and affecting. I don't mind that he always sings off-key, either--part of the charm of his pop is how loose it is. But the voice is so wacked-out that even if you'd never seen Lloyd lurching around a stage or matching magic with Tom Verlaine you'd sense that where for the Shoes or the Beat teen romance is a formal stricture, for him it's an evasion--he's just not telling us what he knows.

In crucial ways he predates punk, and formally this is more Warren Zevon or Tom Petty than Tom Verlaine. What makes it go isn't songwriting--please, kids, never ever rhyme ""fire"" and ""funeral pyre."" It's Lloyd's concentration, plus of course his guitar, which I'll take over Mike Campbell's or even Waddy Wachtel's nine tries out of ten.

Like any aspiring popstar, this sweet-voiced world-music natural from Niger and Dakar thrives on a format that isolates his trickiest tunes. Not especially danceable, too slick to power through the wall of incomprehension that separates Anglophones from his multilingual homilies, this best-of showcases an expansive adept of Eurovision style. The synthesizer isn't my favorite ax either. But it can cut through the undergrowth like anything else.

Skip the annoying skit. Then play and preserve in whatever passes for your permanent collection five consecutive autobiographical songs so detailed and painful and loving and classic I have to name them all: ""My Life,"" ""Meant for Me,"" ""Mommy I'm a Princess,"" ""Mrs. Williams,"" and the amazing ""College,"" beat just a drum with three different DeJs rapping over and behind and in between each other. After a much better skitit's DeJ ordinaire, with the advisory ""Go for What You Know"" and the skeptical ""More Money, More Problems"" worth active attention. But the shit's still free and out there, and don't kid yourself--it won't always be.

Then that killjoy Future starts nosing around, and I mean literally, in her pussy, which is as joyful as that one gets. And then comes two pieces of theoretical product I hope earn her a full-length.

Lofgren has apparently regained his prodigious gift for the hook, and most of these songs catch and hold. But his visionary flash has dimmed. Somehow I expect more of this always-the-best-man never-the-popstar than a concept which demands devotion from his various women on one side while declaring devotion to his career on the other.

Struggling for cred as aging rappers will, they stumble occasionally. Some of these ideas obviously seemed funnier when they brainstormed them--the Bloomberg rap that could be any cartoon mayor's, the incomprehensible ""Spell It Out,"" the flat conceit of not giving a ""honk""--and many come down well on the amusing side of hilarious. But most are amusing, and a few--the Robyn-fueled dance instructions of ""Go Kindergarten,"" the manly boasts of ""Diaper Money,"" the you-only-live-once-(so-watch-it) advisory that builds to ""Two words about furniture: killing machines""--are as inspired as anything on Incredibad, where they wouldn't have fit because the rappers were younger then. Best DVD extra: the gay marriage-themed ""Spring Break Anthem.""

FALSE,B+,Things Fall Apart,Lonesome Bob,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2105,"
A Nashville naysayer with a painful vision of domestic truth, a robust rocker who's fond of words like ""overidealized"" and ""problematic,"" an organic intellectual who looks on the dark side, this guy is too smart to let the music take care of itself. But music isn't where he puts his conceptual energy. On maybe half these songs, he gets the words just right--cf. the outrageous ""My Mother's Husband,"" about not always getting what you want, and the merely clever ""What Went Wrong,"" about the practical parameters of psychotherapy. Every time he does, the music sounds fabulous.

The down-to-earth poor-boy stance is an improvement on the boho excesses of the new L.A., though sometimes it's hard to pin down why these impressively particular songs go with this impressively seamless country-rock synthesis. Put it this way--they don't soft-pedal life's big fat downside, but they're good-humored about it. If you don't pay attention, you think Mel Tillis's ""(Sweet) Mental Revenge"" is one of theirs.

""Looking for Lewis and Clark"" is some anthem, but like ""Start Me Up"" it may reveal more than it intends. These guys seek the explorers rather than the wilderness for the same reason they name Gram Parsons and Tim Hardin as forefathers, rather than Hank and Lefty. The self-conscious distance may be healthy--whatever drove Parsons and Hardin to their roots also turned them into dead junkies. But it's got to cut into the immediacy of the music, and for all the informed intelligence of songs like their tribute to black Memphis superstation WDIA, the album does come to a point at ""State of My Union,"" which aggravates the honest chauvinism of Ronnie Van Zant's reflections on the same subject with the gratuitous self-righteousness of Neil Young's.

FALSE,B+,The Real Chuckeeboo,Loose Ends,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5776,"
Conceived in London and cut in Philadelphia, their funk is so suave and supple that on previous albums it slipped into the background without anyone noticing, including them--and until now, me. Here the ballads have more energy and the groove has more thwock, with the result that the whole first side moves like a living thing. This is fitting--despite a modicum of drum/keyb programming and a plethora of overdubs, the two instrumentalists constitute a band almost neotraditional in its liveness, its discreet spontaneity and sinuous swing. And the three voices are deployed with sensuality and effervescence.

Two born buskers split a six-song EP that contains, the very idea, at least four identifiable songs. Pioneering Courtney-basher Lord covers Lucinda Williams and follows Kelly Willis and Two Nice Girls to a Janis Martin rockabilly number. Sean Tillmann deserts the one-man punk band Calvin Krime to wax sardonic about his funeral and his misspent youth, both of which I hope he lives to enjoy.

Having achieved world renown as a 16-year-old innocent with a throaty voice, a head on her shoulders, and the nerve to dissent from a style of upward mobility invented by black people a pole away, she returns four years later as what else--a pop property with a sex life. Thus her chief musical collaborator is Taylor/Sia/Carly Rae helpmeet Jack Antonoff rather than New Zealand svengali Joel Little, and it's Antonoff plus the extra grain in her voice that make the difference here. For me, the most meaningful line is ""Put my hands under your T-shirt,"" because it suggests someone who's thought about how this sex thing works. Deep, no. Real, in theory. Sex life, presumably. Pop property, absolutely.

FALSE,B+,Strange Trails,Lord Huron,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16675,"
Repurposing sonics from Buddy Holly and Workingman's Dead, this beguilingly melodic and cheerful-sounding record is about love and death at the end of the world--a world that for metaphorical purposes is barely settled woods and wilderness without a trace of the urban jangle and connected chaos that drive so many under-30s to distraction. The idea being that even without that postmodern stuff bearing down, life'll get you good, although sometimes they confuse life with pretty girls who don't work out because they're devilish or full of fate. But assuming the urban jangle doesn't spiral out of control, they could beat this thing yet. That's why they bother with the tunes.

Though I wish they'd re-remixed the I-wanna-sit-on-your-face one even further into the pornographic stratosphere, here at last is product brazen and unwavering enough to live up to the canard about never underestimating the power of cheap music. Sure disco denizens already know its four hooks and big-beat blare backwards and forwards. But ignoramuses like me might as well pick up a few sex tips while broadening our cultural horizons.

The painful detail and joyful exuberance are there once they get going. But in under two years this Welsh punk sextet has matured/devolved from tromping over their pan-sexual alienation like so many glockenspiel-wielding grape dancers to enacting ""miserabilia"" about how unfulfilling it is to get on your knees next to a urinal. Things aren't always so dire, and maybe that one is more ironic than the album title. But the joy of convincing punters they're a band is wearing off, leaving wordman Gareth less inclined to joke around about not just urinals but half-requited love and the ""catastrophe"" they still make a musical stab at staving off. So this really could be ""The End of the Asterisk,"" and to put a point on it they bait their second 2008 album with one of the most underwhelming tour DVDs ever cross-collateralized. How little fame it takes these days to mess with people's heads.

Jerry Jeff Walker's backup band transcends its own roots to offer the best evidence to date for Austin's rep as the last refuge of the hippie visionary. The record will probably stand as the best by a new group this year; side one is virtually unflawed; and Gary Nunn's ""Money"" reminds me of Peter Townshend's ""Tattoo"" in its understated rock and roll eloquence.

Doug Sahm produced these four young Chicanos from Salinas, and they share his uncomplicated commitment to the pleasure of making music with a good beat. Even more than Sahm, though, they're influenced by the ballroom--leader Louis Ortega's sincere, one-dimensional lyricism harks back to early Airplane and Dead, as does the band's flowing, literally laid-back 4/4. Good lyrics, too. Inspirational Verse: ""Once you said you loved me baby/Now I cry for that one time.""

FALSE,B+,The Lounge Lizards,The Lounge Lizards,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3693,"
John Lurie has a real gift for night-crawling high-kitsch themes, but to hear him improvise alongside Arto Lindsay is to learn how hard it is to make music out of noise. After all, it's the precisely timed cut-'em-up verve with which Arto skronks and gweezes into the themes that gives the Lizards their edge. But for some reason--weak takes? rushed mix? Lurie's sense of posterity? vanity, perhaps?--he's all but inaudible on many cuts here. Result: Slaughter on Tenth Avenue Goes to the Mudd Club--fun, but not the real fake.

Before they were a mediocre jazz group or a hot fusion band they were a mordant postpunk concept, the avant-Raybeats. More than their antiseptic Editions EG album, this captures their raw sleaze, not to mention John Lurie's reptillian embouchure and (on three cuts) Arto Lindsay's cool-defying guitar.

The record ends with John Lurie grousing about the way his minions skip practice. Disgusted, he says the hell with it himself and checks out a party, soon revealed as the source of the greasy, swinging groove underpinning his voiceover. Lurie likes the music so much that he goes into the next room to peep the band, and oops, it's the Lizards. On none of the garish set pieces preceding this capper do they sound so at ease with themselves. But on every one they sound as sardonic as the guy who thought it up. Which is how he wants it.

On side one the Jimi Hendrix tribute of (Arthur Lee's) Vindicator gives way to an Otis Redding, from simple songs to rhythmic gutturals, although Lee the ironic popmeister sticks his head in twice, which makes the naive optimism of ""With a Little Energy"" seem a little less one-dimensional. Different Lees contend for side two--Otis, Jimi, Arthur, the weirdo who thought of ""Singing Cowboy,"" and sewer designer William DeVaughn, whose top-five hit from earlier this year Lee has the audacity to cover. Be thankful for what you've got indeed.

Too bad these punk-going-no-wave neotraditionalists didn't study their Ramones harder--instead of crowding 21 songs into 45 minutes, they might have grouped the 14 snappiest into a dandy 27-minute shot in the dark. Of course, that would have consigned most of conceptualist Alan Licht's to the cutting-room floor. Here's hoping Licht gets bored like the arty dilettante he is.

What his claque cheered as wit, wisdom, and soul I suspected of meanness, pretension, and bald (ha ha) expropriation, but now that he's gone Hollywood, I enjoy his smarts and sound. Right, there is the character who killed his grandma for her gold tooth la-dee-dah. But whether he's flattering penguins, flirting fruitlessly with waitresses and record ladies, getting Dr. King's picture out of South Carolina, or nailing the limits of somebody else's soulful sincerity, he keeps it sprightly. This is pop, where clever gets you further than wise.

Lush, charming, and powerful, this is the most tuneful way to feed a Barry White jones. I admit that the titles on side two go ""I Needed You--You Were There,"" ""I Belong to You,"" ""I Love You So, Never Gonna Let You Go,"" and ""Love's Theme,"" but Jerry Ragovoy's ""Move Me No Mountain"" sums up White's basic pitch better than White ever has (read that title again), and anyway, lyrics aren't the point. The point is the voices, which have taken on enough personality to be called archetypal as opposed to anonymous--sensitive, willing, and a little more credulous than is good for them.

When I heard the funky force-beat of ""Night Time DJukeing"" I was delighted--sounded like the man had invented DOR all on his own, and in Wales yet.

He's shed one guitar player and no hooks and as a man he's probably better for it: his cool seems more casual, his lust more committed. But the music is tossed off with what sounds like indolence rather than charm, and since Billy Bremner and Terry Williams are still on hand it would be too pat to claim he needs a real band. Hard to make that casual commitment sing, I guess.

Marital strife seems to have transformed Lowe from a power popper with brownout problems into the genre artist of roots eclectic he's always wanted to be. Slighter than ever lyrically and yet stronger overall than its two predecessors, this leads with a Tex-Mex something called ""Half a Boy and Half a Man,"" and that's where it means to stay.

For five years Lowe has marked time without ever quite losing the beat, and his most mild-mannered album of the decade is also his most consistent. I admit I missed the trademark sarcasm at first--until I realized that the most remarkable cut was a straightforward band-composed instrumental best described as mild-mannered Duane Eddy. Then I decided that the wimpy ""I Knew the Bride"" remake was deliberate--old beau Nick in the throes of fond regret--and went on from there. Will anybody notice this stirringly minor achievement? Probably not. Will I remember it myself a year from now? I wouldn't stake my job on it.

Another small victory in his longstanding battle against the irony that made him famous, and he sure ain't the only one--as they get older, guys who were smart enough to keep their distance as callow authenticity fans can't resist playing their hard-earned experience straight.

Bill O'Reilly, we salute you--for most of this record, you've inspired your favorite rapper to make good on his rationalizations. For once he's ribald rather than obscene, subversive rather than gratuitous, especially when he's attacking you and yours on ""Blow It Out Your Ass"" and ""Fuck You"" (official titles: ""Blow It Out"" and ""Screwed Up""). ""Splash Waterfalls"" examines the intimate links between fucking and making love; ""Pussy-Poppin' ""(official title: ""P-Poppin' "") is worthy of Dyke and the Blazers. But on track 13 (superstitious? me?), here comes the X-rated misogyny of ""Hoes in My Room,"" which Ludacris palms off on O'Reilly and I blame on hired dick Snoop Dogg. This disrupts the three-way that follows, after which Luda's losers shoot people for four minutes. Not in real life, of course.

This well-regarded Canadian folkie can't be the first to turn the yodeler's ""yo-de-lay-ee"" into the lover's ""you're the lady."" But I bet no one else has based a song cycle on the joke: the history of a marriage in which the pair build the house he celebrates with the preliminary climax of ""Now We Got a Kitchen."" Sad to say, the less auspicious climax that ends the record proceeds from ""Seems like you never wanted me around"" to ""Happy ever after's not the easy part."" But that doesn't mean they're finished any more than ""We're saving up for date night so we can have our fight"" meant they were in trouble when the monkeys were little. So I tell myself, anyway.

Having walked out on three different bands led by this dame, I have the credentials to certify this funny, sexy, accidental little record. Half the time she exaggerates her flat Cleveland accent into a hickish, dumb-and-dirty come-on or parody of same, and half the rest of the time she plays her foolish nihilist poetry for laughs, which leaves a quarter of the time when she's the nihilist fool I'll walk out on till the day she dies.

Lynn projects total empathy for the protagonist of the title song, a Topeka housewife who knows about women's oppression firsthand but regards ""women's lib"" as a glamorous media event, as distant as Liz's ""million-dollar pact."" An epochal two-and-a-half minutes, class-conscious in the great country tradition, and I don't care if it was written by a man (Shel Silverstein) who also works for Johnny Cash, Dr. Hook, and Playboy. What follows is an ordinary country album done right, avoiding banal covers and providing auxiliary songs of consistent interest. Lynn's ""L-O-V-E, Love,"" about talking dirty, is among the best, and there's not a bummer in the bunch. How many works of rock can you say that about these days?

I had hopes this might take its place beside one of my favorite country albums, Lefty Frizzell Sings the Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, but Patsy Cline's legacy is a lot narrower than Jimmie's, and Loretta's not quite the singer Frizzell was, either. At forty-one, her voice is thicker than Patsy's was when she died at thirty, and she's a lot more country, especially in her pronunciation--that slight lisp, and the way she distorts the vowels around ""r"" sounds. On the other hand, she has decent material to work with for once, and her ""Why Can't He Be You"" is a breathtaking object lesson in the connections between suffering and exaltation. Annoyance: the seven-minute spoken reminiscence that closes the album.

While the midrange emotions here are projected likably enough, they're nowhere near as powerful as on George and Tammy's best-of, perhaps because L&amp;C have never been a real-life couple. But this does offer fourteen virtually dudless tracks and includes four great ones--two blatantly comedic (""Spiders and Snakes"" and the classic ""You're the Reason Our Kids Are Ugly"") and two shamelessly bathetic (""The Letter"" and ""As Soon as I Hang Up the Phone,"" both graced by long passages of recitative).

Ronnie Van Zant may intend those bullets for ""pencil pushers"" (which means not only me but you, I'll bet) but that's no reason to shoot him down. In fact, it's just the opposite--his attraction has always been the way he gets his unreconstructed say. Unfortunately, the music could use some Yankee calculation--from Al Kooper of Forest Hills, who I figure was good for two hooks per album, and Ed King of New Jersey, the guitarist turned born-againer whose guitar fills carried a lot more zing than three doodooing Honnicutts.

Are these four rather Dollsish (Johansenish, really) tracks hard-rocking, or are they the platonic ideal of hard-rocking? A close call. Which is why I'm not convinced DMZ veteran Jeff Connolly makes up for his bad rep with inspired madness--either he's not inspired enough or he's not mad enough.

The talking drummer dominates three other percussionists on Maal's attempt to forge forward-looking pop from the rhythms of Senegal's Tukulor minority. Tricky, sometimes busy, with Maal's tenor cutting confidently through the crowd, it's closer to rock than soukous--funky sax here, lead guitar there, horn charts everywhere. It's also very much itself. Which gives you some idea of where one tradition-conscious African thinks the future must lie.

""I Don't Know"" was known to the Big Bopper, ""Poison Ivy"" was bad before bad knew its name, and ""You're a Fool"" is the only blues in history to employ the word ""sauerkraut"" in a simile. All three are recommended to the immediate attention of Mr. Buster Poindexter. Also, all three were released, unlike eight of the other cuts here. The unreleased stuff often score lyrically--Mabon's gift for hostile yet self-deprecating wit is in full display on ""I'm Tired"" and ""He Lied""--but relies on blues readymades.

Rapid rhymes, crisp enunciation, common-sense politics, and pop-weird dub give this English toaster the most auspicious U.S. debut of 1990--a best-of from all his just-U.S. released albums could be a meliorist Fear of a Black Planet or a socially responsible Mama Said Knock You Out. High points here include ""Coconut""'s African Methodist accent and a climactic third-world threefer. But the title tune isn't what it could have been.

And though the co-billed Lewis is big and original for an alt-beatmaker, his percussion-oriented version of an E Street Band, strings-swell-to-big-finish aesthetic has its icky moments. But as someone who shares Macklemore's moral views if not his equation of sincerity with soul, I find only the alcoholic's confession ""Neon Cathedral"" too much, and that one's counteracted by the relapser's confession ""Starting Over,"" just as ""Sayin' 'That's poetry, it's so well-spoken,' stop it"" counteracts his art talk. He's especially good on old cars and old clothes.

FALSE,B+,Mad Crush,Mad Crush,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17423,"
Because the guitar-bass-drums-violin as well as the vocals aren't so much subtle as mild, these seven love songs never work up the right pitch of emotional intelligence. But you still believe in your heart that John Elderkin and Joanna Sattin are a couple, because only a couple would notice these things? In the jocose ""My Pre-Existing Conditions"" Elderkin admits to two left feet, getting stuck in the past, needing to talk before bed, and there's more. In the pained ""Where Does It Hurt"" Sattin is so sick with ennui she asks only that he still be there in the morning. And he will be, because elsewhere they stay in bed, miss each other when they don't, and overnight a Christmas turkey on Amazon Prime so it'll be there for the Fourth of July.

These Alabama-born Californians wore pre-Nudie suits, called their music ""Okie boogie,"" and eventually settled in Hollywood, yet somehow little sister Rose is now a minor bluegrass icon who respects the verities for labels like Takoma and Arhoolie. I prefer her Hollywood. Admirers of the Morrells' cover of ""Ugly and Slouchy"" will have some idea how hot and funny ""The Hiccough Song"" and ""I've Got Four Big Brothers"" and their sendup of ""I've Got a Woman"" are. But when Rose puts heart and soul into ""Green Grow the Lilacs"" or ""Bringing In the Sheaves,"" I keep expecting one of her bros to break into a stage cackle, and it never happens.

FALSE,B+,One Step Beyond,Madness,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5398,"
We have entered the era of the white drummer--suddenly every young rock and roll band that touches vinyl can generate a moderately exciting pulse. Of course, Madness's pulse is exotic as well, and if at first I compared them to the Kingsmen, seeking fame and fortune by adding local color stories from the Portland bars to their repertoire of borrowed licks and melodies, that was mostly because it wasn't rock and roll enough. But after I heard more ska, lots more, the exoticism faded, and not just from exposure--I realized that a big problem with Afro-polka was that it didn't sound hip enough, and resisted. Anyway, Madness do it more rock and roll than anybody. Homy and bumptious, they're more purely fun than the most giddily self-conscious power pop.

FALSE,B+,Like a Prayer,Madonna,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2205,"
Three times I've mistaken her polymorphic promo and gross ambition for standard-issue lowest-common-denominator pandering, and three times her audience has disabused me in the months and years that followed. But though I swear I won't get fooled again, it's hard to hear an icon in the privacy of your own home, especially if you don't believe in her, and I won't sink that low or fly that high--I can't. So say the kiddie psychedelia is ick, the side-closers are over when they're over, and everything else sports some little touch to remember it by, Prince or musique concr������������������te or broken quote from the Association. The cocksucker's prayer is anybody's classic, but coming from, I don't know, Suzanne Vega, the declaration of filial independence and the recommendation of romantic independence would be uncharacteristically catchy cliches.

I prefer Erotica, the last time her shape-shifting audacity was more than a trope, and Music, the Mirwais-informed culmination of a period that could well last the rest of her career--could in the end be remembered as her career. Instead of playing at pop, using it as a platform from which to mount a fusillade of cultural challenges, she now is pop-blandness at its best, a model of a modern mental health, replete with ecumenical enlightenment, domestic contentment, liberal politics, and plenty of exercise. Not that she's limited to these themes; on the contrary, she role-plays as a matter of course, because (as she's long since established) that's what pop professionals do. And now it's time to sum up. So she gleans goodies from the overrated Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light, mixes in the glorious soundtrack-only ""Beautiful Stranger"" and the dismal soundtrack-only ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina,"" and hands it all over to Mirwais for sonic tweaking I'm not interested enough to pin down. An essential package.

She did make an album like this before: her debut, where she flitted so astutely between producers that fools took her for a casting-couch queen. But where Madonna had a distinct feel, disco that partook simultaneously of electro minimalism and pop sellout, it also had distinct parts. Here she subs out the flitting to producer Stuart Price, who digests the entirety of '80s dance music into a flow that subsumes all details and referents. If anything, it's more a dance record, leaving those of us with a sentimental weakness for distinct parts a little lost. So not only am I glad she rhymes ""New York"" and ""dork,"" I'm glad she put her kabbalist on the guest list.

In this Amerindie version of the Eurythmics, Stephin Merritt pulls Susan Anway's strings: where Annie would belt these metronomic tunes all the way to Vegas, Anway trills them in a sweet monotone and is grateful she can manage that. She's proud to play the puppet, which is a good thing because synthere thongwriter Merritt would drop her if she wasn't. First time out the literary brilliance of his doggerel lapped over into an obscurity his crude sonic eccentricities sometimes rendered unlistenable. Here he's learned to mesh straight pop parodies with well-turned, thought-through, not-quite-representational lyrics in which Anway usually plays a guy. Many are just mildly subversive love songs. But my favorite is so flat-out campy it could have been inspired by a Man From U.N.C.L.E. rerun.

Those who haven't already memorized Stephin Merritt's oeuvre will have to expend real effort acquiring a taste for him this late in the game, so they might as well experience the full glory of his eccentricity. The 6ths' album isn't just for his cult but by it, and Holiday may mislead the unwary into believing there's some warmth to him. This is where his dolorously impassive baritone and fugueing toy keyboards are at their most anonymous, original, tuneful, and forbidding. Since every single lyric mentions roads or trains, call it his concept album about escape, probably from himself. Even though it isn't where he rhymes ""Coney Island"" and ""prostitutes in Thailand,"" it's verbal enough to inspire willing workers to decipher the lyric sheet, and its sonic identity takes the Casio demo to unheard of extremes--like something conceived by a Martian who'd read about country music in The New Grove but didn't happen to own any guitars.

The concept is, not only do all these deadpan titles start with an i, they're performed (in alphabetical order!) by the deadpan I in question.  When the songs are not just clever but lively--most spectacularly on the unrelenting ""I Thought You Were My Boyfriend""--Stephin Merritt's demo-ready monotone could pass for a singing voice. When they're not--often not lively, and once or twice, heaven forfend, not clever--he sounds as if he's waiting to be swept off his feet by Sophie Von Otter. At which point we who were rooting for more ""I Thought You Were My Boyfriend"" sneak out the back door.

This relaxed, witty survey of musical Afro-America is strongest when its compositions verge on interpretations. You hear the steel drums on ""West Indian Revelation"" and realize that the foreign lilt of ""Chevrolet"" is Caribbean.

FALSE,B+,Between Nothingness and Eternity,Mahavishnu Orchestra,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7327,"
This live album is as rough as they're liable to get on record--I even hear a quote from ""Sunshine of Your Love,"" and the raveup on Jan Hammer's simple rock tune ""Sister Andrea"" is a ballbuster. Empty patches are inevitable but remarkably few. I'm beginning to wonder, though, how long McLaughlin can make his fusion work. Because this is jazz, McLaughlin and Cobham really do improvise (about the others I sometimes have my doubts). But because it's rock the notes and accents they play don't matter all that much--what communicates is the concept, which is mostly a matter of dynamics and which hasn't changed at all over three albums. Not that the improvisations count for nothing, or that striking new melodies--which are in short supply here--couldn't keep things interesting for quite a while. But it's not going to be automatic.

Recorded in the late '70s, with tough mgqashiyo mbaqanga out of favor among cultural as well as assimilationist blacks, this proves Mahlathini's staunch loyalty to the style he originated, his total lack of alternatives, or both. The notes say its ""refusal to compromise"" delivers ""Mahlathini at his very peak""; I say that without Makgona Tsohle and the Mahotella Queens it sounds almost as generic as late Toots, even though (and probably because) the man carries the lion's share of the music himself. But I'll add that the glosses make me wish I could follow along more closely. A city ""where women have got no mothers,"" a challenge to witch doctors, and a greeting to the spirit of his own youth all seem to transgress ever so slightly against the traditionalism that is mbaqanga's chief strength and most daunting limitation. Good.

Those personally offended by industrial-grade EDM, the gaggle of pop divas, or that dick Diplo will blame this record for purveying any or all of the three. Me, I'm a picker and chooser, hence grateful that said dick gave me a reason to enjoy Ellie Goulding and Ariana Grande, because good Lord I've tried, and to get closer to enterprising Jamaican-American Nyla and especially indie-pop strivers Wild Belle, whose hummed, crooned, and ultimately keened opener provides the perfect warmup for the harder stuff.

Well, though their core quota's a lot lower than Juluka's, we have heard guttier mbaqanga--on Rough Trade's Soweto, Earthworks's Zulu Jive.

Compounding once and future Iceberg Deke Leonard with two Help Yourselfers and the minimum quota of Williamses and Joneses, this is the best record to come out of San Francisco in quite a while, pretty impressive for a band that never saw the Golden Gate till after the thing was released. The chemistry's right, that's all--Leonard's eccentric dissonances and gullet-model wah-wah are sweetened by the Help Yourselfers and rolled with a steady rock by Williams and Jones. Unphilosophical but trenchant, short on tunes but chocked with riffs.

Manchester is very sexy in a barely disciplined, almost blowzy way--maybe a touch overexpressive, a little too liberal with her emotions. ""I Got Eyes"" is nice juicy fuck music and ""Stevie's Wonder"" the ultimate fan letter from someone who's found a new model of overexpressiveness.

Was he playing his kora like a poser or a master, watering his tradition down or raising it to a new level? Because I was too ignorant to tell, I soon stopped caring.

There's too much hippie about these guys--their gnarly neotribalism is so male that if they get big enough they'll pull the show-us-your-tits crowd like flies to patchouli. But they're a hoot attached to an ethnomusicology seminar, such dyed-in-the-wool wanderers that their Gypsy tramps and thieveries are like an organic bohemian tradition.

If side one makes it seem that reggae has turned into the rasta word for boogie--even to a Trenchtown tragedy recited with all the toughness of an imprecation against litter--the unimpassioned sweetness of most of side two sounds like a function of reflective distance, assured in its hard-won calm. Some of it's even better. The Haile Selassie speech recreated here as ""War"" is stump statesmanship renewed by a believer, and if the screams that open the second side don't curdle the corpuscles of the baldheads who are being screamed at, then dread is gone from the world.

As with so many black artists from this country, Marley's latest lyrics seem a little perfunctory, mixing vague politics of dubious depth with hackneyed romantic sentiments of dubious depth, and so what? Marley is not obliged to devote himself to propaganda. As with so many black artists from this country, the music is primary here, a message appropriate to his condition is conveyed by the unrushed rhythms and the way the sopranos share equally with the instruments and the new wariness of his phrasing and dynamics. Some of the cuts are flat, but if the O'Jays were to put five or six good ones on an LP--including two as striking as ""Jamming"" and ""So Much Things To Say""--we'd call it solid and enjoyable at least.

Neither his arty producers nor his Ethiopian band force the kind of cheer that wimped out his earlier crossovers, and his sharp, gritty singing replicates his old man's lower half even if the spiritual-romantic flights are beyond him. He's gotten less platitudinous, too, though as a prophet's scion he never invests Rasta doctrine with the authority of ideas struggled for--a black Jamaican cosmopolitan enough to voice sympathy for a ""white guy in love with black beauty"" sounds as priggish as any other puritan when he goes on about alcohol and processed foods.

Slowly--too slowly, but faster than we had any right to hope--he's getting it: if ""This generation will make the change"" doesn't convince, ""When will the innocent stop being punished for their innocence"" will certainly do.

Though many tout him as the big talent in the family (not counting Dad, of course), they're just making conversation: he's more fun for damn sure, but his artistic personality is still unformed.

As the first young jazz musician ever to enjoy true major-label promotion, Marsalis is trapped into selling an image whether he likes it (or admits it) or not. On the one hand, he inevitably attracts admirers who respond not to the substance he hawks so assiduously but to the idea of it, which makes me wonder whether they really thrill to the shadings and dynamics that up till now have constituted his genius. And on the other hand, those of us who can't stand his expensive tailoring and neoconservative pronunciamentos are tempted to dismiss the pleasures they insure. Listen hard enough and pleasures reveal themselves in profusion, but despite what Marsalis believes even their profusion isn't quite reason enough to bother, because in his wrongheaded determination to adjure the trendy and the obvious, he never lets loose. Most of us would say that inventing meaning while letting loose is the essence and promise of jazz. Neoconservatives wouldn't--maybe because they're not up to it.

At Material's best gigs Sonny Sharrock's aural grimaces challenge the impassively abrasive rhythm section; here Cliff Cultreri marches to bassist and drummer while Michael Beinhorn flatters Philip Glass.

Although his angular, slightly hyped-up groove on the instrument is distinctly his own, Bill Laswell is a typical bass player in the most important way: what he expresses depends on who he works with. Beyond drummer Fred Maher and synth threat Michael Beinhorn, his collaborators here include Fred Frith, Sonny Sharrock, and Henry Threadgill augmented by lesser avant-jazzmen. All obviously love the harsh, expansive intelligence of preschlock jazz- (and art-) rock. But their great ideas are rewarding rather than tempting, and they're not exalting either.

The male version of Laurie Anderson's Strange Angels is a marriage made in purgatory between two cold motherfuckers: Bill Laswell and Bill Burroughs. Seamlessly synthesizing new-age atmospherics, authentic African passion, and arena-rock dramaturgy, Laswell devises settings for the sci-fi ecopessimism of the greatest reader of our time. Not that it's all dead souls and dire consequences--for balance and to prove he can do it, Laswell also constructs an inspiriting third-world anthem from the remains of John Lydon's ""Poptones.""

Music box. Hurdy-gurdy. Pinball gallery. Turning point of silent movie. Between-innings entertainment at a minor-league ballpark. E Street pseudoclassical. Even, almost, ? and the Mysterians. That's how pop history is conceived by Kory Gardner. Words aren't quite irrelevant--cf. ""This is the whiner's bio,"" or ""Set the rocks on fire."" But they are ancillary.

FALSE,B+,Escape From '85,Spoek Mathambo,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16071,"
Insofar as I even know what these remixed hits from the year of Mathambo's Soweto birth are--""Like a Virgin,"" got it; ""Centipede,"" don't tell me you forgot Rebbie Jackson; ""Shikisha,"" must be Cape Town's Razz Brothers; ""We Can Dance,"" search me; ""Future,"" ditto--the resemblance is minimal, often based on some beat element DJs notice so we don't have to. All are transformed into rap-disco lite that bears Mathambo's Afropop-futurist stamp no matter who his collaborators. So airy it's perfect when you need a lift. Also so airy it threatens to float away altogether.

FALSE,B+,Curtis,Curtis Mayfield,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7371,"
Initially I distrusted these putatively middlebrow guides to black pride--""Miss Black America"" indeed. But a lot of black people found them estimable, so I listened some more, and I'm glad. Since Mayfield is a more trustworthy talent than Isaac Hayes, I wasn't too surprised at the durability of the two long cuts--the percussion jam is as natural an extension of soul music (those Sunday handclaps) as the jazzish solo. What did surprise me was that the whole project seemed less and less middlebrow as I got to know it. Forget the harps--""Move On Up"" is Mayfield's most explicit political song, ""If There's a Hell Below We're All Gonna Go"" revises the usual gospel pieties, and ""Miss Black America"" has its charms, too.

Wish the praises of God etc. weren't half in English, though I suppose the Prince's upwardly mobile platitudes go with his need to venture beyond his tribal tongue. Anyway, from this Nigerian popster the blandest platitude sounds blissfully gentle and upward mobility has a good sense of rhythm.

M'Benza promises ""the best of Paris"" for his state-of-the-tech Les Quatre Etoiles moonlight. Organ-synth, string-synth, drum-synth, supervoices, balafon, accordion--we get 'em all. And when the sweet male chorus inserts gruff commands, or M'Benza makes his soukous guitar hop mbira-style or sway like pedal steel, I'm willing to ignore the horns, which I swear come off some old Kassav' album.

FALSE,B+,Girl Going Nowhere,Ashley McBryde,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17282,"
The hot country news in tough country womanhood has enough attitude to stick it to every algebra teacher and Church of Christ deacon who ever looked down on her. But her multitude of good lines yields only two great songs: ""Livin' Next to Leroy,"" the first of what I hope will be many meth-and-opioid dark-siders genre-wide, where her cable-stealing role model ODs while she tokes up at her high school graduation to impress him, followed by ""A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega,"" the grittiest and most utopian of her four I said four road anthems. Like the socko endings she's both blessed and cursed with the voice for, her attraction to this self-replicating subgenre makes me hope that the success she's earned leaves her free to do more with her rosy future than big it up.

FALSE,B+,Prairie in the Sky,Mary McCaslin,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2296,"
I consider it just that the most convincing cowboy-based music in years should come from a woman who starts off with this request: ""Pass me by if you're only passing through."" The voice is high and lonesome, not given to gush; the instrumentation is built around an acoustic guitar, but accommodates a single French horn, a drumset, or both, when appropriate; the songs--both borrowed and original--are a lesson to L.A. cowboys everywhere from an L.A. cowgirl who makes her records in Vermont.

FALSE,B+,Old Friends,Mary McCaslin,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2297,"
Side two begins brilliantly, seguing from ""My World Is Empty Without You"" to ""The Wayward Wind,"" two unjustly forgotten chestnuts from disparate traditions that are freshened immeasurably by McCaslin's eccentric, exacting mountain style. But ""Blackbird,"" which leads to a charming ""Don't Fence Me In,"" has been overrecorded, and the finale--the title cut and sole original--is flat. Side one's three highlights are nice enough, but ""Oklahoma Hills"" doesn't live up to Arlo's, much less Woody's, and ""Pinball Wizard"" is a weird, brave mistake. In short, the interpreter's dilemma--attagirl, but no cigar.

Any old boy who can get arrested for ""cuttin' up some honky with that bone-handled knife"" has earned this perfect new-rockabilly title. But as you might expect, he has more to say in the action-packed tales of adventure (""Honky Tonkin',"" ""Morgan City Fool"") than when he's trying to prove he's a grownup (""Lesson in the Pain of Love,"" ""Troubled Woman"").

FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Mel McDaniel,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8242,"
McDaniel's marginal distinction doesn't depend on the marginal cleverness of songsmiths, but if his hits don't equal his high points, they're not his low points either. ""Hello Daddy, Good Morning Darling"" is a heart-tugger that would work for anybody from Ronnie Milsap to George Strait, but his commercial specialty is the mild raunch of ""Louisiana Saturday Night,"" ""Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On,"" and ""Stand Up,"" where he invites all the mild raunch fans to testify and tempts non-believers to forgive ""Do You Want to Say Goodbye.""
"
FALSE,B+,Last Straw,Chuck McDermott and Wheatstraw,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7390,"
As befits a Yale dropout, McDermott makes country music with an edge of educated subtlety--the comic sendups of cars and compulsive consumption sound quite a bit more political than Jerry Reed's, the forlorn laments a whole lot more existentialist than George Jones's. Yet Jerry Reed and George Jones are definitely the comparison: McDermott may sound a little like Phil Ochs or Keith Carradine in their country personas, but his voice is stronger and more country. The drawback is the ragged backup from Boston's finest, who sound like folkies who have not yet developed any viable equivalent for slickness.

Though it enabled her to waltz off with the Country Music Association's artist-of-the-year award in her gender division, this longtime up-and-comer's second MCA album may pass outsiders right by. Its vaunted neotraditionalism is long on detail work--a thick hillbilly accent so soft-spoken it never intrudes, songcraft so steeped in the canon it splits the difference between evocation (side one) and clich������������������ (side two). Those who miss the good old days are advised to think of her as Tammy Wynette with"
FALSE,B+,The Best of Reba McEntire,Reba McEntire,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2903,"
I'll take this benighted distillation over what we've heard of her kind of country, mostly because it's a distillation (from 1980-1983, when she was on her way to neoclassicism). Donna Fargo at her cheeriest couldn't get away with the keynoting ""(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven,"" the Platters cover would be useless even without the strings, and ""My Turn"" is sexy-gal at its most repulsive (""You have reached the woman in me through the man in you,"" she notes as she offers the guy a blow job). But songs like ""I Don't Think Love Ought to Be That Way,"" ""I'm Not That Lonely Yet,"" and ""You're the First Time I've Ever Thought About Leaving"" group around the same sexually self-possessed persona and would stand out on any album she has in mind. Jerry Kennedy rarely overdoes the schlock. And though the voice has less character, it's also less sedate.
"
FALSE,B+,High Time,MC5,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7393,"
At its best, this combines the anarchic energy of John Sinclair's album with the pop control of Jon Landau's album. ""Sister Anne"" is a passionate farewell to a Catholic boyhood, and the jazz climax, however ill-conceived sonically (the horns sound funny after all those guitars), gets where it's going, fast. Mistake: ""Miss X,"" an atrocious fuck-me-babe ballad. Some things they'll never learn.

FALSE,B+,Pronto Monto,Kate & Anna McGarrigle,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1889,"
The blandout of this quiet but piquant duo is being blamed on producer David Nichtern's all-too-steady hand. And sure, I'd prefer tempos that deviated more than five degrees from dead ahead and tasty licks that didn't whisper monosodium glutamate. But I also expect that these tough, smart women consented readily enough to his devices, especially as their own songwriting now aspires to a sweet directness that Nichtern himself is better at (compare his ""Just Another Broken Heart"" to Anna's ""Oh My Heart"" or Kate's ""Come Back Baby""). And I'll trade you Ann's ""Bundle of Sorrow, Bundle of Joy"" for the next Maria Muldaur album sound unheard.

FALSE,B+,From the Blue Eagle,Bat McGrath,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7394,"
Unlike so many singer-songwriters, McGrath sounds like he comes from somewhere--upstate New York, as it happens. Instead of attaching generalized reflections to the most surefire melodies available, he writes lyrics that evoke specific locales and situations--like Jimmy Buffett when he's good, or Tom T. Hall with a more literary flair. Granted, anyone who believes a wino is ""free"" should check in his thesaurus under ""nothin' left to lose,"" but the abundant compassion, humor, and detail of these brief ballads make you want to hear them again. A small find.

FALSE,B+,Start Breathing,The McGuires,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5438,"
With hundreds of other bands working out imperceptible variations on songform, usually by admixing noise or roots or exoticism, the McGuires aim to do nothing new, and since they have the gift of song to begin with, that's a plus. Oh, they do call their friendly sound ""barbecue-beat,"" but there's no petty territoriality here, no minute formalism expressing selves that are barely worth the trouble. Just middle-class rock-and-rollers voicing their middle-class disaffection with a measure of lyric grace. I'm fond of ""T.V. Party"" (they're not going), ""Let You Down"" (and apologize in advance), and ""She's a Lawyer"" (""Sorry, sister, she's not gay""). You may like the one about the prophet Elijah.

FALSE,B+,Massachusetts,Lori McKenna,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16846,"
The statistics are pretty stark. Six songs (1-5-6-7-9-12) fairly astonishing and six (2-3-4-8-10-11) more country-generic; the same six bare and direct and guitar-colored, the others hook-cushioned and keyboard-reliant; the same six--this is the tell--credited solely to McKenna, the others all co-written. Not that the co-writes don't do Nashville's assembly-line tradition fairly proud. But comparatively they're gooey and mechanical--it's a downer when the thought-through details of ""Smaller and Smaller"" resolve into generalized nostalgia, when the quiet sanity of ""Shouting"" builds to a rousing chorus. And not only does the material no one else touched have more bite, it tracks: where 1-5 are brutal breakup songs, 7-9-12 make more of long love than Nashville generally has the brains for. So it's ""You ain't worth the spit in my mouth/When I scream out your name"" and ""Make every word sting/Make every word bleed/Until I'm not gonna want to love you anymore"" to ""Every time you walk away from me you come running back/How romantic is that?"" and ""You whispered something in my ear last night/Some years ago you wouldn't have thought to."" And then there's a happy ending: ""Grown Up Now."" It's about her oldest kid.

FALSE,B+,The Tree,Lori McKenna,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17354,"
No one tills the themes of marriage, family, and the passage of time as fruitfully as McKenna. But although both the opening ""A Mother Never Rests"" and ""The Tree"" itself are so well-put it would be simple-minded to slot them as cliches, their roots in truism run so deep that their considerable portion of actual truth will probably escape nonbelievers. The sole masterstroke is ""The Fixer,"" where a handyman fears all his ginger ale on the nightstand and keys to locks long departed will never ease his wife the fighter's . . . pain? fear? anger? depression? We don't know, and maybe he doesn't either. So be glad ""You Won't Even Know I'm Gone"" and ""You Can't Break a Woman"" on marriage and ""People Get Old"" and ""Young and Angry Again"" on the passage of time are close enough to masterstrokes themselves.

FALSE,B+,Duck Rock,Malcolm McLaren,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12188,"
McLaren knows how to record African music for Western ears, and the ebullient tunes he's collected here more than make up for his annoyance quotient. But the intrusions of the World's Famous Supreme Team, not to mention the featured vocalist, are annoying nevertheless. And when ""Song for Chango,"" which has existed since ""before Jesus Christ was born,"" gets credited like almost all the other compositions to Malc and producer Trevor Horn, I wish he'd thought to mention which specific Africans contributed to which specific tracks. Culture may be collective, but (in this culture) wealth ain't.

FALSE,B+,Fans,Malcolm McLaren,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10300,"
Although what attracts McLaren to opera is proven commercial tunes he doesn't have to pay for, he does end up making sly, slantwise connections between two wildly successful strains of romantic superschlock: Puccini and disco. ""Madam Butterfly"" has the killer hook, with McLaren's Pinkerton a bizarre yet rather affecting country-cockney hybrid. But the great genre-fuck is ""Fans"" itself, with disco diva Angie B. doing a recitative so dumb and charming it reminds us not only that you don't need brains to love opera but that this may well be the nicest thing you can say about the stuff. Listen to Angie stumble over a few notes of real Puccini in the coda, then ask yourself whether featured soprano Betty Ann White would improve them by doing them right.

In which the top musicians in fusion are gathered by the man who made it all possible to show the genre off aesthetically--no funk vamps, no one-run solos, no twaddle about the harmony of the universe. The project has a certain stillborn aura--it doesn't swing a lot, there is a reliance on Speedy Gonzalez climaxes, and snatches of such deathless melodies as ""Holiday for Strings"" and ""Mohammed's Radio"" are audible. Still, repetitiousness is minimized, and there are good ideas and lots of sensitive interaction. And it didn't sell diddley.

Recorded in New York in 1969, when McLaughlin's studio appearances were amazing everyone from Jimi to Buddy to Miles, this prefigures Mahavishnu's fusion at an earlier, jazzier stage. Pretty intense. The rock guy (drummer Martin) sounds a lot more original than the jazz guys (keyboard player Berger and--especially--saxophonist Surman), but only the justifiably ubiquitous Holland (on bass) can keep up with McLaughlin. And believe me, even if in historical fact it's McLaughlin who's trying to keep up, that's how it sounds.

No longer a minimalist, she layers samples (""Rockin' It""! Millie Jackson!) and backtalk like a pro, sometimes like an original--the rhythmic obscenities on the spectacularly unsisterly ""Shut the Eff Up! (Hoe)"" are mind-boggling. Her tales of the drug wars are tough and prowoman, and the narrative tone of ""Cappucino""--part fable, part metaphor, part confessional revery, part dumb it-was-only-a-dream--is avant-garde. Elsewhere she's a pro.

FALSE,B+,Too Long in the Wasteland,James McMurtry,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5441,"
He's gonna be a prestige item, just you wait--quality singer-songwriter from the heartland-wasteland. He's been there, he's still there, has his own RFD box on the back cover lest you doubt his authenticity. Also an eye for detail, perhaps from his novelist dad, and John Mellencamp showing him around the studio. I enjoy his sketches, their weary women especially. But like so many singer-songwriters and so many local-colorists, he tends to a soft fatalism, especially when he tries a big statement: the metametaphorical ""Painting by Numbers,"" or ""I'm Not From Here,"" which notes that we've been picking up and leaving ""since the stone age."" No way a simple quality singer-songwriter can change that, now is there?

Those who want blues from the 12th Street and Vine will enjoy McShann's album with T-Bone Walker (on Classic Jazz). This is something else--Kansas City jazz rendered by an instrumental ensemble that never gets bigger than the mid-'70s Rolling Stones. And although I'm no aficionado of the horn chart, I enjoy the interplay of instrumental colors on standards by Waller, Basie, Ellington, and McShann.

""Streets of London,"" a gentle attack on folkie self-pity, is one of the several appealingly melodic urban miniatures, and it doesn't stop there. McTell is so softhearted he ought to check in with a cardiologist (maybe that's why he sounds so sad all the time), but he's not empty-headed; he knows what his world-view portends. Hence, ""First and Last Man,"" a celebration of a real primitive--the epoch isn't identified, but I'd guess Neanderthal. So why is he in the studio with Gus Dudgeon? Beats me, but it doesn't hurt.

Both sides are unimpeachably sensible and unfailingly pleasant; except for the closer, each of the ten tunes paces proudly by in full confidence that it will set you humming. Yet as reported, the proceedings are a little, shall we say, somnolent, which I blame not just on a voice whose deep satisfactions are best appreciated in the company of brighter and flightier ones but on a drummer who isn't Mick and a bassist who isn't John.

This vocal trio from Chattanooga was recorded by Brad Shapiro in Miami and Muscle Shoals for a Fort Lauderdale-based Atlantic subsidiary.

Furious negativist then, goofy nature mystic now, Curt Kirkwood is the David Thomas of endearing sloppiness. The tunes unfold loosely and sweetly, with Curt's guitars not so much chiming as chattering in a nonchalantly unstylish take on neofolk lyricism. But the music's charms are a little too flaccid to hold up the most unabashedly lysergic worldview yet to emerge from postpunk.

FALSE,B+,Out Our Way,Meat Puppets,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5445,"
In a time when EPs register microdistinctions among white bohemians, not to mention professionals, this is one piece of product that's more than a holding action in musical strength and commercial strategy. It's a departure, toward a less spacy, more bottomy hardcore-gone-folkloric. It covers ""Good Golly Miss Molly"" at a speed approximating that of the original--which was considered fast in its time, believe me.

This post-prison freedom cry is a 19-track marathon whose beats rise and fall while a solid third of its rhymes expand on Mill's unsought status as a case study in the racism of the parole system. If only it didn't also return tediously to the females he's fucked, who by actual count occasion almost 90 reps of the slurs ""bitch"" and ""hoe,"" five times as many as the affectionate ""shawty""/""girl""/""mami."" He does at least seem to savor their bodies sometimes, which is never a given. But he sounds far more motivated pointing out that that's rapper cash not dealer cash before Jay-Z unfurls his deepest billionaire brag to date, or delivering the hard hood truths of ""Oodles O' Noodles Babies."" And ""100 Summers"" builds to a quatrain that identifies and then contextualizes the enemy within: ""Grew up 'round them monsters they'll shoot you in your face / Ain't used to showin' no love that's 'cause we grew up in that hate / Live by the sword die by the sword way / Tried to make it home they shot him in the hallway.""

Marking time and maybe taking a small, honorable profit in the bargain, they heat up the remixed title tune to accompany (surprise) a Gram Parsons cover and two originals: a typically realistic, typically depressive response to the miners' strike, and a typically commonplace, typically grim letter from a woman who should have blown the whistle on her dad.

Nobody would take them for amateurs or anarchists on this evidence. Just a catchy, rocking Brit country band with more enthusiasm than skill in the vocal department and lyrics-included that don't seem to have much to do with honky-tonks--that tend overmuch to the metaphysical, metaphorical, and obscure for all their show of specificity. I await the next phase.

Reports that they've ""gone reggae"" are grossly exaggerated and no big deal--the Bellamy Brothers beat them to that crossover by a country mile, and the skank that kicks things off is as lovable as anything they've ever done (bumbling semipros they may be, but their drummer used to work for the Rumour). If only they were hip enough to cover ""Old Hippie"" (that's a Bellamys song, kids), all would be well. As it is they cover (some would claim redefine) ""Heart of Stone"" and write bookish lyrics I don't understand even when I've read the authors in question.

FALSE,B+,I Love Mekons,The Mekons,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3716,"
Right, love songs, laid out casually across disc and lyric sheet--a country album without a happy ending. Jon and Tom are too cynical, but they're not too callow, so their scenarios generate recognizable permutations of lust if not ecstasy, emotion if not devotion, and when Sally Timms sings about that ""Millionaire,"" they sound like the great old pros they are. Too often, though, love just doesn't seem like their subject--the only time the music achieves carnal knowledge of the message is on the sarcastic ""Special"" and the confused ""I Don't Know.""

This acoustic group-sing had me hedging like a derivatives trader when it came out--until I observed eight humans called Mekons sit around grousing and banging on tour. Dressed like the wraith of a ska boy and dancing like a drunken undertaker, die-hard Londoner Tom Greenhalgh especially made these death songs come alive--not just Tom's dismal opener and Jon Langford's can't-come climax and everybody's desert prophecy, but the animal fables, the mystery history, the agricultural workers' carouse, the unplugged teeter-totter for the digital age. If you don't know much about these 30-year veterans except that they're legendary, this probably isn't where to find out why. If you have any idea what I'm talking about, however, partake.

Unlike my straightlaced friends, I've always dug the idea of Melanie--Edith Piaf as Brooklyn waif, preaching the hippie gospel in that absurdly flexible and resonant alto. But I've found the reality cloying. Here she grows up just enough. ""Brand New Key"" is one of those impossible celebrations of teen libido that renew one's faith in AM radio. ""Steppin'"" is the best breakup song since ""It's Too Late,"" and though side two slips badly toward the end, she's rarely a simp this time out.

Having long wondered what gave this longtime Bowie stablemate the right to speak for the average guy, I've decided it's his talent, which is pretty damn average. That's okay, because the success ratio here, a nice average fifty-fifty or so, just goes to show you what sincerity, hard work, and modest ambitions can do. Mellencamp has half outgrown the fatalism that always underlined the predictability of his Stonesish bandmates, who've gotten tougher with age, an encouraging sign in rich musicians. I wish I knew (I wish he knew) exactly what ""Justice and Independence '85"" is trying to say. But I'll take ""You've Got to Stand for Something"" at face value.

The lead singer's name is Theodore Pendergrass, not Harold Melvin, which you'd only know by reading Soul or Jet--he's not mentioned anywhere on the record or double-fold jacket. Pendergrass boasts just about the most powerful voice ever to hit soul music, though not the richest or most overwhelming. Although his smashes are dance tunes like ""The Love I Lost"" and ""Satisfaction Guaranteed,"" his real calling is big ballads, especially ones that assert dependence--""Is There a Place for Me,"" ""I'm Weak for You."" But did they have to kick things off with ""Cabaret""?

Black suffering above the poverty level is the lyrical twist of ""Bad Luck"" and ""Where Are All My Friends"" (written not by Gamble-Huff but by Carstarphen-McFadden-Whitehead), and to Pendergrass's credit he seems to get it--even makes a few asides. He also generates tremendous romantic authority--you really believe he wants to meet up with her ""Somewhere Down the Line."" He doesn't do the impossible for ""Pretty Flower,"" though, and given the credibility of most of what remains--not to mention the intrusion of the mysterious Sharon Paige--the impossible is all that would push this over the line for me.

FALSE,B+,Wake Up Everybody,Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7420,"
The sustained dynamics of the title track get me past its muddle-headed lyrics--Gamble-Huff sometimes act as if ""hatred, war an' poverty"" came along just as they were running out subjects. And I can still go along with Teddy Pendergrass's tender strength. But sometimes he sounds a little more insecure than I think he intends--he's prone to bluster and chest-pounding, and some of his grunts are almost coughs. Anyway, he's gone.

FALSE,B+,At the Chelsea Nightclub,The Members,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7421,"
The inheritors of English punk haven't turned to power pop; they're putting their energies into reggae. Britain's own indigenous black music, with the r&amp;b syntheses of the Stones rather than the blues imitations of the Savoy Browns serving as precedent. The crude feel and committed socioeconomic awareness of this album recall 1977, but the rhythms and tempos leave room for their rebellious-suburban-lad-escaped-to-the-city to give forth with a slyer kind of humor.

FALSE,B+,Business as Usual,Men at Work,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5456,"
They call Australia Oz because it's about as exotic as Kansas upside down, and these five sturdy-sounding, fragile-down-under blokes make the most of it. Ten thousand miles from the heart of darkness they're free to project honest, ordinary, low-level Anglo-Saxon anxiety, with enough transpositions of key and meter to establish that they've thought about it some. Call the music auxiliary Police, with more players and fewer dynamics. The words aspire to a bland compassion that sings its origins in the vaguely rebellious ""Be Good Johnny,"" about a schoolboy who ""only like[s] dreaming,"" and justifies its universalism by finding Australians everywhere from Brussels to Bombay.

As benign an evolutionary mishap as the koala bear, this displaced pub-rock band does its level best to act friendly and crazy despite disheartening life experiences. Along the way, keybman Greedy Smith sings Roy Orbison's ""Workin' for the Man"" like Dave Edmunds couldn't dream it, and headman Martin Plaza enlists his mates in the impossible task of closing the Nick Lowe gap.

A follow-up to There's a Riot Goin' On by a group identified as ""Black Mer-Da"" on the disc itself, before someone at Janus got cold feet. No more riots here than with Sly, or course--just self-hate, misogyny, desperate poverty, and senseless violence, as out-of-tune voices declaim strangely catchy tunes over loitering funk patterns and jagged guitar. ""Sometimes I wish I'd never been born,"" they announce flatly, and they can really get flat. But the most surreal passage comes toward the close of ""My Mistake,"" when ""I should have killed her instead"" (author's note: of the friend he caught fucking her), horrifying enough as a surprise endline, is transformed into a little piece of art-funk, repeated amid various instrumental configurations by an off-key chorale that sounds positively transported.

FALSE,B+,Struttin',The Meters,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7424,"
The New Orleans M.G.'s swing, but not smoothly, the way a big band does--their Caribbean lilt is pure second-line, as elliptical as a saint's march. They're the secret of Allen Toussaint-produced hits by Lee Dorsey, Aaron Neville, and Ernie K-Doe, and because they put out riffs rather than songs their own LPs are consistently danceable and listenable. Of course, to do better than that the band would have to come up with more good riffs in a year than most rhythm sections manage in a decade, and usually they compromise a little--only two r&amp;b hits here, plus several other tracks that might have been, ""Wichita Lineman"" not among them.

Although it's worth noting that their first hit for Warners, ""Hey Pocky A-Way,"" is as old as the second line, it's also worth nothing that they're getting results from their experiments--namely, the twelve-minute funk fusion ""It Ain't No Use."" And if most of the time the vocals are neutral at best, what this bunch of amateurs makes of ""Just Kissed My Baby"" isn't dreamed of in Three Dog Night's philosophy.

Outside of New Orleans the Meters are a cult band. All they accomplish by going pop/disco is the loss of their critical rep (whatever that's worth) and the erosion of their sales base. Yet leaving Allen Toussaint for David Rubinson was evidently the right move--he respected them so much he was even sparing with the Tower of Power. A very good commercial funk record, right down to covers that go with their natural beat--one from Peter Tosh and one from Allen Toussaint.

The fact that this was overrated as part of the same extra-musical chain reaction that caused Maya to be underrated doesn't mean it was merely well-timed and, as they say, well-played. It takes a while to congeal, but for fans there's spice aplenty in the skinny beats-for-their-own-sake that dominate a first half whose most memorable line is ""try to outschool us so we jump on our scooters"" (on ""WWW/Meds/Feds"" seven minutes in, and FWIW the Wikipedia times are 40 seconds off on my version). But after ""Vicki Intermission"" come three consecutive songs that'll make you madder than you were already that the artiste thought it provocative, as they say, to leave the album untracked: the well-hooked ""Gen -N-E-Y"" followed by ""Bad Girls"" and ""Marsha/Britney."" Theme statement: ""You can have my money but you can't have me."" Whether she's singing it for her penniless sisters or her affluent self is impossible to tell. That's why they call her provocative. Also, um, controversial.

As everybody but avant-bigots knew from hearing Wham! on the radio, Michael can prove that photogenic and popwise aren't mutually exclusive while combing his hair with his left hand. Substance, depth, simple human decency--that kind of stuff is more problematic. So the show of soul, in the grain of the lyrics as well as the voice, makes a difference. But let no one forget that the vulnerability and compassion here purveyed are staple commodities of the truly popwise, and that the album's only conceptual coup, ""I Want Your Sex,"" stands as an ambiguous publicity stunt worthy of Madonna herself.

People say I sound like a baby, but I'm a hundred per cent woman,"" she chirps on ""Special Thanks,"" most of them tendered to the usual sexist suspects surrounding her producer and guest rapper, N.W.A.'s Dr. Dre. A rapper she's not--like Bobby Brown or Al B. Sure, she's a singer in a rap world, and though her voice is less surprising when she doesn't talk, she gets the decibels up there even with her warble set on squeal. She can liquefy like Chaka or Teena, too, which is impressive even though neither songstress could get away with these slow ones. The fast ones hint at what an L.A. woman has to do to get the sexist suspects to stop calling her a bitch with the tape running--act half-nice, half-nasty (in a word, ""Nicety""), and assume real love is her prerogative.

Side two does seven great songs with umpteen instruments in just over fifteen minutes, a perfectly amazing miracle of concision. But side one is less than hot. Two (why two?) just-wrong Johnny Mercer songs lead into a properly excessive intro to Ann Peebles's ""Breaking Up Somebody's Home"" that is destroyed inside of two minutes by an improperly excessive, funkless production. Bette's overstatement works on ""Surabaya Johnny"" and ""I Shall Be Released,"" but I've heard better. Most important, why isn't there one song by a contemporary composer here? Dylan doesn't count--I'm talking about Randy Newman, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Joni Mitchell, maybe James Taylor or Cat Stevens, she's always made me believe in miracles. As it stands, this record is perilously close to the ostrich nostalgia of her dumbest fans.

After not figuring out who Peter Garrett sounded like (sotto voce Roger Waters slightly, Peter Gabriel not at all, Peter Hammill not really, David Bowie what else is new), I decided his animadversions were in fact generic, and not in a bad way--he hectors like a crank politician would hector if the politician were a rock singer. Since this rock singer is in fact a crank politician, his authenticity requirement is thus satisfied. Nor is it a bad thing that his band is hooking it up these days. Garrett remains irritating even as you start singing along in spite of yourself, which is all anyone can ask of a crank.

FALSE,B+,The Very Best of the Mighty Clouds of Joy,Mighty Clouds of Joy,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7436,"
This two-disc set presents the pre-crossover Peacock-label gospel and the ""appeal to Pop/R&amp;B audiences"" as a continuum, and while I'm still a fan of the Clouds' first Dave Crawford LP, guess which period sounds better. Is it the formal purity of the Peacock stuff, leaving the excitement to Joe Ligon's falsetto-piercing shouts, that makes their sermonizing seem so unpresumptuous? Or does the music just go with the message, as in the overbearing orchestrations of the more recent ""God Is Not Dead"" and ""Look on the Bright Side""? One thing I know--gospel songs are written by mortals, too, and all the faith in the world isn't going to make a good one out of a bad one. An acceptable one, maybe.

As on so many reggae albums, songs that sound flat at first sink in if given the chance. But reggae's simple melodic devices are wearing so thin that this isn't always a plus--I resisted the title cut even more stubbornly once I remembered how it went, and the old political messages remind me more and more of Sunday school. Nevertheless, I remain basically interested until the middle of side two, with special curiosity as to the current whereabouts of ""King Kong.""

These guys sure can rap and rhyme, and they do. But whether they're up to scripting comic books I'll leave to the experts. Continuity by Headnodic and his Quannum-channels-Too-Short funk.

The Afro-Chicano love man front-loads his Prince-channeling debut album: five hooky tracks--two romantic ones linked by an ambivalent interlude to one about a prostitute and another about a quickie--followed by six pleasant tracks and capped by two hooky novelties, the second of which delights immatoorly in the old ""piece""-""peace"" homonym. But there's a treasure hidden in the middle. With supplicant's songs rare enough in a genre that makes its nut promising untold pleasures, ""Teach Me"" is unprecedented, laying out the truth that, as Norman Mailer put it in one of the few useful sex tips in his orgasm-mad canon, ""the man as lover is dependent upon the bounty of the woman."" Who knows what pleases her? She does, she alone, and Miguel craves to be let in on that shifting and enthralling secret. If only he'd hung a top-drawer melody on the sucker he'd have a ""Use Me"" or ""Sexual Healing"" he could sing forever.

Macon meets New Orleans in Glasgow for a lesson in Scots soul, historical division. Allen Toussaint provides the New Orleans, but though his songs (""Brickyard Blues,"" yeah) certainly stand out, he doesn't hog the stage--Miller's rough warmth and knowledge of literature keep the album in play.

Miller had never impressed me with Inner Circle on Capitol, so I put aside this solo effort without much pain. Then an adept suggested I flip the loudness switch and turn up the bass and treble--advice that applies to all of Tom Moulton's reggae remixes for U.S. UA. Boom--different music. The Rasta homilies area little thin and the remakes of ""Why Can't We Be Friends"" and ""Dock of the Bay"" unnecessary, but ""Tenement Yard"" is neither, and I love Miller's basic vocal trick, which makes him sound like a kid imitating a machine gun. The adept tells me Inner Circle sounds better in Jamaican too.

FALSE,B+,The Dreamer,Rhett Miller,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15690,"
Miller fashions his excellent tunes within such a narrow melodic compass that it always takes too long for the new ones to get sorted, and the Nashville-trad self-production on his fourth solo album doesn't sharpen their outlines much. But as usual the songs come clear eventually, starting with a Ben Kweller collab bearing the aptly ominous title ""Lost Without You."" It's not the winner here because the lyric could be stronger, which cannot be said of ""Complicated Man"" or ""As Close as I Came to Being Right,"" not to mention the miserable ""Out of Love."" Consider those titles. That's why I said ominous.

Miller's eccentricity--James Cotton harp amid the Sam Cooke amid the technologized ditties--has no center or even epicenter except for the pastoral antimaterialism so common among exurbanite rock tycoons. But in the end his borrowed hooks and woozy vocal charm are an irresistible formula. Finds good covers, too--""Mercury Blues"" (copyright 1970 by K.C. Douglas, whoever he is) fits right in.

I know I'm not supposed to say this, but I've never bought Mingus as Great Jazz Genius--Important Jazz Eccentric is more like it, I'd say, especially in his more ambitious compositions. The 27-minute title fantasia is rich, lively, irreverent, and enjoyable, but it's marred by overly atmospheric Hollywood-at-the-carnival moments, while the kitschy assumed seriousness of ""Music for 'Todo Modo'"" almost ruins its fresh big-band colors.

Alain Jourgenson is said to hate Steve Albini, and why not, but I still think Big Black changed his life. Whomp whomp whomp whomp, these huge ugly slabs of beat are like the metal of dreams, all urban din and therapeutic brain damage, only done with synthesizers. Though I wish I knew what they were bellowing about down in the abyss, this will tone up your innards a lot more efficiently than whatever's hep in garage grunge these days.

Industrial's edge on metal is anonymity--unlike major-brand sonic barrage, it presents itself as resultant rather than expression, music/noise emanating from a society/culture. It's objective; it doesn't imply a subject. This illusion boosts the music/noise's impact and authority while rendering it virtually indistinguishable from itself (as well as difficult to access from what's human/humanist in our aesthetic sense). The bestselling Chicago version gets faster and purer with every release. Even when Alain Jourgenson raps, or apes (hires?) John Lydon, I could give a fuck who he is or what he thinks. Which is essential to the intended sensation.

Play this back-to-back with Minott's 1979 Black Roots and then tell me reggae never changes. The progress is subtle, but I promise you'll hear it plenty clear enough. It begins as usual in the rhythms, which Sly &amp; Robbie take over from lesser lights, but that doesn't explain why Minott, a creamy lovers rocker of no special distinction, not only keeps up but adds fillips of his own, fillips that would have been buried in the 1979 recording even if he'd been capable of them then. Sure the songwriting's improved too, but in this kind of music meaning inheres in responsive interaction. If formalism it must be, let it be formalism of the body.

Where at first this seemed to prove that irrepressibly avant-garde bands are catchier when they don't set out to ""write hit songs,"" now it's obvious that the commershal concept is total rather than part joke--only the trumpet parts (horns symbolize sellout to punks, maybe because they're so hard to play) mark a significant departure. Songs are catchy enough, too, with the catchiest lasting eight minutes including six-minute outro. Very mersh.

From ""A Heart Disease Called Love,"" a John Cooper Clarke setting that might have been plucked from the bowels of Nashville, through ""Glad"" and ""Hey , Lucky,"" first side's new studio songs aren't what you'd call glad--more like mournful, angry, and depressive.

Right, he has played and may yet again play drums in Fleet Foxes, whose beat means so much to us all. But that's not the good part, for goodness sake. The good part is that, under the influence of organic psychedelics and the American road, he figured out how to deploy words, as in the deathless couplet: ""And I'm writing a novel! Because it's never been done before!"" Whereupon, presumably, he also figured out that novels were a losing proposition. And though he dumbs up his songwriting half the time by fearing fun literally as regards forward motion, don't give up. Beyond ""I'm Writing a Novel"" itself, the four best tracks are the four last tracks, where he picks up the tempo and looks fun in the eye. He could use a more outgoing drummer, though.

The 305 canonical English and Scottish ballads are obviously good tunes--time-tested, one might say. And these seven are pretty much unchanged, too. Yet subtle fiddle, accordion, pump organ, and especially bass liven up the acoustic guitars just a touch, and both Mitchell's fluting, childlike lead and Hamer's mellower follow avoid purist sanctity as well as modernizing pizzazz. If only I could swear the presentation is so beguiling I keep the plots in mind. But I will say that the two about mean parents thwarting true love speak more directly to my spirit and conscience than the one about the fine lords going down on their very own Titanic, and point out that what saves the princess-laying Willie of Winsbury is he's R-I-C-H rich.

Album eight is most impressive for the cunning with which Mitchell subjugates melody to the natural music of language itself. Whereas in the past only her naive intensity has made it possible to overlook her old-fashioned prosody, here she achieves a sinuous lyricism that is genuinely innovative. Unfortunately, the chief satisfaction of Mitchell's words--the way they map a woman's reality--seems to diminish as her autonomy increases. The reflections of a rich, faithless, compulsively mobile, and compulsively romantic female are only marginally more valuable than those of her marginally more privileged male counterparts, especially the third or fourth time around. It ain't her, bub, it ain't her you're lookin' for.

When you peruse the lyrics, which are of course provided, the rage she directs at evangelists, racketeers, financiers, and so forth seems like the usual none-too-deep left-liberal modernism--a ""culture in decline"" enthralled by hedonism and rapacity and the image, tsk-tsk. But by taking her mind off her ever-loving self she's broken a long drought. There's no what-shall-I-do ennui in her singing; she isn't musing, she's telling us something, and her interest in these well-expressed middlebrow clich������������������s comes through.

At first I thought this reunion album lacked magic, but these guys sound remarkably whole for a band that failed to take over the world in 1967. You can hear the country undertone now, but you can also hear why you missed it--at their most lyrical these guys never lay back, and lyricism is something they're usually rocking too hard to bother with, though their compact forms guarantee poetic justice. Full of hope as they foresee their doom, stoned and drunk and on the move and yet always together, and above all intense, they should have at least taken over the country. All they really lacked was a boss, and what could be more American than that?

They were quintessentially inauthentic--three bar-band honchos, a showbiz kid, a hippie head case, and a svengali with a specialty in indentured servitude. Their accomplishment was nothing less and nothing more than the invention of El Lay country-rock--in San Francisco, where they were dismissed as phonies and interlopers. The Eagles would have happened without them, Poco too, but these guys got to the hyper harmonies and amped-up licks before they constituted any kind of copout. They also played the blues, jammed supernaturally hard, and put 14 loopy, optimistic songs that saw beyond the provincial counterculture of the Haight on a debut album ineptly overhyped by a label that still doesn't know what to do with it. The canard that they never cut another decent track is no more absurd than said label's assurances that they have two-and-a-half hours of memorable music in them. Yet only on this two-CD set can you purchase Moby Grape. Conveniently, it comprises the first 14 cuts. And typically, the sublime ""Fall on You"" is wrecked by a minute of producer gab even more justly unreleased than the rest of the crap that fills out the package.

Dolly hopes he'd love her even if she wore different-colored shoes; Leonard hopes she never sees him in his old earmuffs.

These aging no-wave stalwarts have outgrown the blinding-headache approach without giving up their stubbornly untrendy belief that you play music for love, with some well-aimed hate thrown in. ""End of the World"" could pass for early Television, and ""El Salvador""--the title is half of the lyric--is the political song of the year (and available even more clear and tortured as a Rough Trade single). Perhaps because the final ten tracks weren't mixed by Chris Stamey, this fourteen-song, thirty-minute tape does cry out for aspirin as it proceeds. But I play it for love.

Lifting everything worth lifting off their 1977 double-best-of and adding four recent hits, this is Subsequently Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown's legacy despite the French ""Look at Me I'm in Love"" and a shrill pressing that narrows their falsettos. Among the additions is ""I Could Have Loved You,"" a second chance at a one-night stand worthy of Smokey Robinson (with a writing credit for Bette Midler). Among the keepers is ""Love on a Two Way Street."" Remember that one? You will.

FALSE,B+,Feelin' It Together,James Moody,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11688,"
On Parker-Gillespie's ""Anthropology"" (astonishing) and ""Kriss Kross,"" the anguish and wit of Moody's second-generation bop reed playing sounds as fresh as if black humor hadn't come to mean something quite different, and when he chooses to divert or soothe he is often intelligent and sensuous. But sometimes (acceding, I suspect, to the more trivial imagination of pianist Kenny Barron) his lyricism becomes so lightweight that its intricate sophistication serves only to disguise its lack of substance. Or maybe I mean that the man should give up the flute.

FALSE,B+,Sweet Charlie Babe,Jackie Moore,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7460,"
Figures that this should fall somewhere between state-of-the-art and great-mean soul: the five hits go back to ""Precious, Precious"" in the winter of '71, with the two latest cut at a funkier-than-usual Sigma in Philadelphia and the others by a simpler-than-usual Crawford-Shapiro team at Criteria in Miami. Moore's voice is simultaneously sweet and rough, an unusual combination in a woman, and the songs are pretty consistent. But she lacks not only persona but personality, so that what in technical terms is pretty impressive stuff never goes over the top.

FALSE,B+,Shake and Push,The Morells,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11416,"
These four permanent residents of Springfield, Missouri, and environs unearth minor classics Dave Edmunds would give his doctorate for. New rockabilly doesn't come any more authentic or less purist than ""Eager Boy"" (he wants to be a senator) or ""Ugly and Slouchy"" (she won't cheat) or their own ""Red's"" (eats). But Rockpile, the Blasters, even the Stray Cats fire their roots into the future with an edgy intensity that's missing from the performances and recording here, which makes the difference on a record that might have been a minor classic itself.

FALSE,B+,The Best Bar Band Ever! 'Live' in '84,The Morells,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14663,"
This Missouri quintet never much rocked the house, playing their ""Rockabilly/Beach Music/Psychedelic Bubblegum"" for fun rather than intensity--a looser kind of release that helps flat patches pass before you know it. And did they have a nose for a certain kind of unprepossessing good song. The Strangeloves' ""Cara-Lin"" and their own ""Growin' a Beard,"" two of the six selections they hauled out for both of the shows these matched 79-minute discs document, each rely on a repetitive chorus of no great import that any sentient human will memorize involuntarily within two minutes. That leaves 37 songs played once, mostly covers you've never heard in your life--a life that will be just slightly happier after you get to know them.

FALSE,B+,Jagged Little Pill,Alanis Morissette,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=40,"
I was down with the Riot Grrrl Appreciation Society on this reluctant refugee from Canadian children's television, who some say was invented by Madonna herself so she could distract the publicity machine while raising her own biological girl. That is, I approved when she played the pissed-off spikehead and recoiled from such candid self-dramatizations as ""Perfect"" and ""Mary Jane."" But with help from six or seven arrantly effective songs, she's happy to help 15 million girls of many ages stick a basic feminist truth in our faces: privileged phonies have identity problems too. Not to mention man problems.

FALSE,B+,Travistan,Travis Morrison,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12567,"
Predictably, Morrison's predictably intelligent solo debut puts personality where the Dismemberment Plan's synergy used to be. If the old ploy almost works, that's because he gets synergy out of sidemen and because the album's better half focuses on his circumstances rather than his feelings, which bog the songs down toward the end. Try ""Born in '72,"" a detailed account of privilege's lineaments and limitations, and don't think you're too well-informed for the edutaining ditties about the penny, the nickel, the dime, and the quarter.

FALSE,B+,Veedon Fleece,Van Morrison,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4096,"
I count it as progress that his muse is feeding him baseball metaphors, but Morrison hasn't vented his Gaelic soul so unabashedly since Astral Weeks. He'd get away with it if there were more than one decent song on side two. Soothing, evocative late-night music that indulges his discursive side. Favorite title: ""You Don't Pull No Punches but You Don't Push the River.""
"
FALSE,B+,Wavelength,Van Morrison,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4098,"
Unlike A Period of Transition, this is a good Van Morrison record, as up as any he's ever made, but it's certainly not a great one. You might pay attention to side two, an evocative reinterpretation of Van's America fixation, but side one is nothing more (and nothing less) than class programming.
"
FALSE,B+,Poetic Champions Compose,Van Morrison,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4103,"
His first interesting album in five years sounds best as a CD for the same reason it isn't all that interesting--in his current spiritual state, which could last until he rages against the dying of the light, he doesn't much care about interesting. He just wants to roll on, undulating from rhythmic hill to melodic dale. If only he'd resequenced the third-stream instrumental ""Celtic Excavation"" so that it closed the full-length digital work instead of opening its nonexistent second side, he'd have framed his dinner music perfectly. Yeah, dinner music--I figure if it doesn't make me want to vomit, it must have something going for it.

FALSE,B+,Enlightenment,Van Morrison,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4105,"
Only a perverse motherfucker would choose such a title for an album whose title refrain goes ""Don't know what it is."" What's he trying to do, fake out the satori market? Also: orchestras, the names of r&amp;b singers, a weird recitative about the radio, and other tried-and-trues, all executed with faith, hope, and charity. Inspirational Verse: ""In my soul, in my soul, in my soul.""

FALSE,B+,Hymns to the Silence,Van Morrison,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4107,"
The usual wealth of fertilizer spread over two shortish CDs, long on love songs and the aforementioned hymns--wish the rejected title Ordinary Life was more accurate. Maybe they renamed the thing so churls like me wouldn't ask why nobody 86'd a few hymns. Like all of his recent and no doubt future work, it's slower than necessary, even in an artist of Van's advanced years. And like so much of his recent and I expect future work, it's more affecting than you'd figure. True love, eh? The simple life, huh? The days before rock and roll, did you say? Sounds kind of good.

FALSE,B+,Bona Drag,Morrissey,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2453,"
To Anglophiles, Anglos, and young alternative rockers who've never known another world, Morrissey's solo singles are fraught with paradigm, but to the rest of us they're a chapter in the life of a great twit. Less secure in his delusions of grandeur and worthlessness than when he was top of the pops, he hides behind the bitchy jokes his followers consider beneath him. At least half of these fizzle-prone chart charges will amuse and excite the curiosity-seeker. That any of them could be conceived as pop hits is why there are still Anglophiles. Inspirational Verse: ""This is the last song I will ever sing (yay!)/No I've changed my mind again (boo!).""
"
FALSE,B+,Kill Uncle,Morrissey,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2454,"
What kills the faithful is the anonymously supportive production, never distinctive enough to threaten (or challenge) a fading superstar in the throes of permanent identity crisis. But though they do meander into the insufferably ruminative self-pity that never used to bother Smiths fans, the songs start out plenty striking, guitar signature or no guitar signature. Tart as a grand aunt, louder on the gay subtext now that he's no longer an antipinup, Morrissey isn't just another English eccentric. He exemplifies what's made eccentricity a staple export of that once-proud nation for generations. Good show.
"
FALSE,B+,Bill Morrissey,Bill Morrissey,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5501,"
There's ten years of rough jobs and bumming around in these trenchant, unassuming songs, with no aura of folkie slumming to stink things up. Morrissey took those jobs to make money, not to gather material, and he went on the road to get away from home. Of course, industrial New England leaves its stamp on everything he writes anyway--his lyrics are so local, so devoid of pop universals, that even if he wanted more than finger-picking on his LP I doubt anyone would give him the budget for it. Which sad to say leaves only a stylized is-that-John-Prine? drawl to carry his familiar little tunes.
"
FALSE,B+,North,Bill Morrissey,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=311,"
His deep voice sheds affectation as his music approaches the delicacy of pure folkie accompaniment, all the better to show off what he's here for: ""idiot verse."" Which is laconic, not idiotic, and damn near definitive on his great theme--how much men need to work and how much they'd rather be doing something else. Never before have so many protagonists been snowbound and liked it.
"
FALSE,B+,Reggae Greats,Pablo Moses,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5504,"
The first three cuts of this ""compilation"" are the first three cuts of A Song, which everyone knows is the better of the two albums he cut for Island. The fourth appears later, as does one from side two. ""Each Is a Servant,"" A Song's purest song, does not. The fine-as-can-be Pave the Way selections represent an aural break just like always. Sure, buy the sampler if you can get it cheap. And if A Song gets sent to the bins to make room, steal 'em both.
"
FALSE,B+,Bring Me Home,Mother Earth,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7464,"
On the face of it this is a slight improvement, introducing three major songs--the Eric Kaz side-openers and Steve Young's ""Seven Bridges Road."" And if the powerful, arresting arrangement of Kaz's ""Temptation Took Control of Me and I Fell"" isn't as far out as what the original band used to try in San Francisco, it's certainly played with more assurance. Still, when you've boiled it down to backing up a singer and the songs, both had better be special all the time. And they ain't.
"
FALSE,B+,Weasels Ripped My Flesh,The Mothers of Invention,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8190,"
Talk about ""montage""--the construction here is all juxtaposition, the composition all interruption. Together with some relatively straightforward instrumentals and ""My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama,"" the album's two finest strokes--a metal remake of Little Richard's ""Directly From My Heart to You"" and ""Oh No"" a devastating reply to ""All You Need Is Love""--would make for a highly enjoyable album. But if Brecht considered pure enjoyment counterrevolutionary, Zappa considers it dumb--that's why he breaks in constantly with dialogue and vocal or electronic sounds whose musical interest/value is essentially theoretical. I find most of these engaging enough to think I might want to listen again some day. But all that means is that I enjoy it, quite moderately, in spite of itself.
"
FALSE,B+,No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith,Motorhead,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5508,"
Vic Maile's power-packed definition obliterates my bias against live recording. Remakes of white lies like ""No Class"" and ""Stay Clean"" and calling cards like ""Bomber"" and ""Motorhead"" save valuable shelf space. So what if it gives me a headache? Sometimes a headache comes as a relief.

FALSE,B+,Approved by the Motors,The Motors,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3730,"
Last time, they essayed a commercial takeoff on punk, which they traced back to Grand Funk Railroad rather than the Stooges; this time (punk having been declared economically unsound by English bizzers), they have a go at power pop and come out sounding like the Foundations rather than the Small Faces. Since reformed pub rockers are more comfortable with cuteness than with power, this is an enormous improvement--""Airport"" is as funny as any Nick Lowe genre piece and catchy enough to do jingle duty at Gatwick. Unfortunately, just to keep up their pseudo-punk credibility, they also include a equivocal celebration of sadism. I mean, fun is fun.
"
FALSE,B+,Rock and Roll Queen,Mott the Hoople,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2469,"
Mick Ralphs's title tune--which is to ""Starfucker"" as Bad Company is the Rolling Stones--defines the virtues and limitations of this raucous compilation. Rescuing serviceable rockers from all of their Atlantic albums and utilizing only the most simple-minded covers (""You Really Got Me"" and ""Keep a Knockin'""), it presents pre-Bowie Mott as an endearingly crude touring band, with enough hooks to keep things going. And it draws on only five minutes of Brain Capers.
"
FALSE,B+,Heretic Pride,The Mountain Goats,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13978,"
Maybe John Darnielle's intent singing isn't putting his lyrics across. If that hadn't long been a question, Darnielle wouldn't be one more alt hero--a former psychiatric nurse who's always writing and spends his life greeting his far-flung cult on the road. He'd be some kind of new Dylan--he's that prolific and that imaginative. Still, one wonders whether 4AD has thrown his critical followers off with its line about how this one abandons autobiography for ""mythical creatures"" etc. Once I'd read along online, looked up ""autoclave"" in the dictionary, and figured out that ""Sept 15, 1983"" was the day Prince Far I was murdered, I agreed that not every song could possibly be autobiographical--not the one about Mike Myers's makeup, for instance. But even the title track could be read as a metaphor about stubbornly nonconformist alt heroes, and half a dozen of these entries are the desperate-to-doomed love songs he's made a specialty. An autoclave is a device that sterilizes with pressurized steam. When the narrator says, ""My heart is an autoclave,"" I suspect he's Darnielle.
"
FALSE,B+,Goths,The Mountain Goats,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17098,"
Propelled though they are by rock-sturdy Jon Wurster, the arrangements evoke a keyboard-based, explicitly guitarless cocktail jazz of modest drive and less bite. John Darnielle sings with a dulcet lucidity that's almost angelic, the melodies chime in, and although I assume I'm missing some references, the lyrics do well enough by goth music and lifestyle from a ""We Do It Different on the West Coast"" perspective. Nonetheless, a lounge-style concept album about goth is not unlike a bro-country concept album about chamber music. That its two great songs--""Abandoned Flesh"" and ""Andrew Eldritch Is Back in Leeds,"" to be precise--reach out not to rudderless fans but aging musicians suggest that Darnielle is ready to move on to the next obsession.

FALSE,B+,Girl Interrupted,Ms. Jade,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11767,"
Decent rapper turns bling bling into ching ching until it stops making a noise, then gets sisterly on your ass, which is an improvement. Street, gangsta, 2-1-5, blah blah blah, she claims ""Different,"" but the differentest thing about her is she's Timbaland's front of the year. With Missy, commercial priorities aren't all Timbo keeps straight. Here he twists and sprawls, coaxing wisdom from Nelly Furtado and Nate Dogg, rapping death metal, layering like Tunisian pastry, and extracting a beat from a Charli Baltimore boy toy. Hey you, blow your whistle. See, doesn't work when I do it.

FALSE,B+,Sweet Potatoes,Geoff & Maria Muldaur,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7474,"
I really like this album, especially when Geoff gets nasty on ""I'm Rich"" and the sophomoric cheap shot ""Kneein' Me,"" both of which he wrote. But Chuck Berry's ""Havana Moon"" gives away his limitations. ""Havana Moon"" simply isn't a very good song--it's only ""interesting,"" as a pop aberration that has nothing to do with the thrust of Berry's music. Muldaur's version works quite well only because it singles out how ""interesting"" (and obscure) the song is. And too often ""interesting"" is all he wants to be.
"
FALSE,B+,Maria Muldaur,Maria Muldaur,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2245,"
Cut by cut, this bid to contemporize Maria's nouveau-jug music (two songs each from Wendy Waldman and David Nichtern, one each from Dr. John and Kate McGarrigle) is intelligent and attractive. But the overall effect is just slightly aimless and sterile. Maybe it's Muldaur's quavery voice, which only rarely has driven me to attention, or the low-risk flawlessness of the Lenny Waronker/Joe Boyd production. Or maybe it's just the curse of the jugheads--not knowing how to make good on your flirtations with nostalgia.

Mundell was all of sixteen when he cut this record in 1976; in 1983 he was shot to death. He brings to the naivete that can be so annoying in Rasta homilies a sweet, clear, militant innocence rendered even more delicate by Augustus Pablo's piano-tinged production. He believes in life everlasting, and he probably deserved it.

FALSE,B+,So Happy,Eddie Murphy,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5517,"
The failure of this wicked Prince rip to scale the charts reminds us once again how difficult it is for defiant outsiders to fracture pop stereotypes. Murphy will never be El DeBarge, but he's perfect for cartoon funk, and over the years his wheedling croon has gotten serious. Maybe the problem is that his sexual urges still don't emanate from very deep inside. Often, in fact, they're inspired by his bathroom reading--he's big on locations, spends an entire song convincing her to do it in a chair. Inspirational Dialogue: She: ""Are you close?"" He: ""If I get any closer I be behind you.""

This is a hair and a half form capturing her amused, husky sweetness and square-jawed sex appeal, and I'll settle. Ballads, message songs, and medium-tempo heart-tuggers have all been slightly upgraded, and the reggaefied Bobby Darin and her latest Beatles cover rock as good as Ronstadt.

Following ""Snowbird"" with ""Danny's Song"" with ""A Love Song"" with ""You Won't See Me,"" the first side is all any curiosity-seeker need own or even know of the singing gym teacher from Nova Scotia. Only a boho bigot could deny these middle-American apotheoses; they bridge cultures as resolutely as C.P. Snow. They also show off Brian Ahern's Nashville country-rock, with Jim Ed Norman's side-closing ""You Needed Me"" improved by the association. Second side's all Norman, and though most of it is equally tuneful and confident, it's complacent calculation is why we need boho bigotry. All told, as neat a demonstration of aesthetic principle as Metal Machine Music.
"
FALSE,B+,Golden Hour,Kacey Musgraves,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17441,"
Product of Nashville though it may be, this is a pop record straight up, marked throughout by song-doctoring overseers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk, who score cowrites on most tracks, play keyboards, drums, and such on every one, and go all but unnamed in its raft of raves. I mean ""pop"" as an observation, not a criticism. Tashian's modest piano parts complement Musgraves's delicate soprano and positive mood more subtly than any pedal steel could; the sound-setting ""Slow Burn,"" about taking all night, and the LSD-fueled ""Mother,"" about ""bursting with empathy"" as you miss her and miss her some more, are triumphs of the pop imagination by any measure. So in the rock era's biggest yet quietest year of the woman to date, this team has figured out how to make quiet sell. If its quiet never breaks on through to the other side, that's not only deliberate but one reason so many are raving and buying. But it's also why I'm not altogether sold myself.

FALSE,B+,No Wave,Music Revelation Ensemble,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5520,"
I know, Blood Ulmer and his boys probably spent more time plugging in their amps than knocking off the music. Too much of it is free-jazz fucking around, even less faithful to their nuclear fusion in its carelessness than the Rough Trade album in its care. Still, when David Murray starts to blow on the one they call ""Baby Talk,"" and not even over one of Jackson-Ali's funkier beats, it's fun, and a revelation. Buy the official version first. But up this one a notch for erring in the right wrong direction.

FALSE,B+,Check It!,Mutabaruka,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2483,"
Is it okay to be impressed by this reggae poet's decidedly unmystical humanist Rastafarianism and still wish his presentation had more of that old-time religion? Though he camouflages his intellectual distance better than Linton Kwesi Johnson, his compassion is less self-effacing, and his dub modernism plays a little too loose with the riddims to suit me. But he has plenty to teach anyone who values reggae strictly for its straightforward charm.

I wouldn't give back rock and roll if it were mine to relinquish and Africa's to claim. But for all his ital hit-and-miss, I hope this Afrocentrist is taken seriously--especially when it comes to such crucial matters as God in the sky (""a universal lie"") and when-is-a-revolution-not-a revolution? (when it's a revolt). Let it also be noted that he breaks into Afrobeat and pop-funk and chamber-synth more meaningfully than universalists do.

Child of a Zulu father, a Xhosa mother, and the Soweto uprising, he lives on the run, reciting his poetry unannounced and unaccompanied at weddings, funerals, union meetings: an authentic art hero, and as committed a revolutionary as ever cut an album. Which doesn't mean he can be comprehended out of context. So what's amazing about his first stab at music isn't the incompleteness of the translation, but the power. Before he utters a word there's some halting guitar that could make you weep, and despite the disorderly percussion favored by Black Consciousness bands he powers a South African dub poetry--with intimations of an apocalypse that's lived every day and agape so hard-earned only a Boersymp would doubt it.

Remember that posthumous outtakes CD Bad Boy attributed to Biggie? No? Good then--it was foul, not just ill shit but stupid ill shit. These finalized versions of tracks fans have long bootlegged is the opposite. Where the ex-dealer thought it wise to conceal his brutishness, the fake thug thought it wise to conceal his sensitivity. Surrounding outtakes that were just outtakes is back-in-the-day recommended to Tim and Missy (even has some pronunciation in it) and four autobiographical pieces. The two about his parents are juicier than the mother love gushing from God's Son. The Afrocentric pep song is so much deeper than the mawkish, misinformed new ""I Can"" that you believe he might yet get politics. And ""Drunk by Myself"" describes his alcoholism. Pass what Courvoisier?

Sax man Nathanson is the second-best composer and best improviser (though not player) in the Lounge Lizards, trombonist Fowlkes his fellow traveler. Here they indulge their fondness for jazz of the real variety without sacrificing their sense of humor or taste in packaging.

Anything but a sucker for texts from the Old Testament, Jesus, Shiva, and Kahlil Gibran, I kept wondering who the bass player was. As I should have known and kind of guessed, it was the text-borrower in question. So never mind about Leviticus--this is the humanistic groove never quite made flesh by the jazz-tinged ambient foreground of Sade, Anita Baker, and D'Angelo.

In which a strong-voiced, historically-minded, salsa-loving Senegalese guitarist and painter records a suitably impressive elder's debut at 74, with his steadfast gravity the linchpin and the band the reason non-Wolof speakers will listen. With Xalam, OK Jazz, and Africando recruits on board, it's basically an Orchestra Baobab one-off with the focus on saxophonist Thierno Koyat? rather than crazier saxophonist Issa Cissoko and the Xalam and OK Jazz guys pitching in where Togo-based Barthelemy Attisso normally moves heaven and earth. The hypnotic clave of ""Bouki Ndiour"" and the warm lyricism of ""Arawane Ndiaye"" might heighten your expectations unduly. But hell--take a chance.

Cut in Paris in 1984 and now wisely remixed, this isn't as epochal as N'Dour thought it was when he wrote the title tune to his displaced Afro-Gallic brothers and sisters.

Produced by Peter Gabriel henchman George Acogny, this is no more a rhythm album than whatever Gabriel opus you care to recall. It's just a very good Peter Gabriel record. Gabriel's m.o. is to pump up rock and ""third-world"" sonorities with grandiose settings and structures, then put them across with a big beat; N'Dour's arrangements are less forced, his beats indigenous enough, and his lyrics better. Sure there are old saws (""Truth will always win against deceit,"" ""You should help those with less than you""), and ""Macoy,"" a  compassionate vignette of lost virginity concealed, is overwhelmed by its portentous synth-wash-and-percussion accompaniment. But when N'Dour, who's put down as a ""ladies"" singer by some Senegalese (men, presumably), advises his four-year-old daughter to follow her ""destiny,"" or collaborates with Gabriel on a feminist anthem you can believe in, I think his quest for fame could be as humanitarian as corporate one-worlders claim. And when he's inspired to write a song about a slavery museum in Africa, the NASA museum in Washington, and his favorite, ""the museum town of Old Tucson,"" his ambition--to grasp the past, change the future, and master the very media to which he's been subject by accident of national origin for most of his young life--suddenly seems heroic.

The arranged rock song may be slipping beyond the reach of white men. In a context defined by Paul Simon and Robbie Robertson, even a talent like Freedy Johnston risks sounding smug by association, while many women--Sin������������������ad O'Connor, Bonnie Raitt, Rosanne Cash, Laurie Anderson--escape the taint. So does Living Colour. And so does N'Dour, whose mbalax commitments mitigate any conceptual link to studio-rock. On 14 songs that once would have required double vinyl, he strikes an African tone far from pop's confessionals and attempted empathy. Directing matter-of-fact moral warnings at the powerful and the disenfranchised like the griot he might have been, he's confident of his social function as he tours the world. And for all that the set-piece stiffness seems as outmoded in America as it must seem modern in Senegal. Since N'Dour usually sings in Wolof, the lyric sheet is a necessity"

Although I doubt a physical would add much context, this download-only album proves that the Dakar tycoon and sometime pol still knows music is his bedrock--without conveying anything specific outsiders can make out, true, but when the music is N'Dour's, that's usually enough. Six new songs, eight tracks, kicked off by the atypical ululations that announce the atypically relaxed title opener and highlighted by three versions of the apparently Senegal-centric ""Mbegu���"" unimpeded by the superfluous guitar intro of the live one, as well as two very similar mixes featuring kora master Toumani Diabate. For Wolof speakers, this album may function as a major statement. For me the major statement is that this great musician and fairly great man is unlikely to go away soon.

Like so many performance artists of the computerized tape recorder, they would have been called comedians or just wise guys in prepostmodern times, so it's nice that they know something about both music and yucks. Rather than elucidating the title theme, I'll name favorite bits: real estate ad atop handgun ad, J5 cartoon, four-year-old singing ""Over the Rainbow,"" lecture on the Autonomous Commie Republic, orgasm on the Playboy Channel. And mention that I listen with interest/pleasure to every one.

FALSE,B+,Country Grammar,Nelly,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2542,"
Cornell Haynes's St. Louis singsong rolls over an easy mix of N.O. Bounce, Cleveland thug harmony, and L.A. tweedle-twaddle. He remains faithful to Cedric the Entertainer's congenial cellphone-jester intro as he works through some mild dope-slangin' and bitch-mackin' consumer fetishism, and despite all the expensive cars I hope he paid cash for, the jolly diffidence of his heavily accented local color makes his hedonism seem more benign and accessible than the N.O. if not ATLien variety. There's bite to the mild moralism he works through, too, especially the St. Lunatics' detailed report on cannabis addiction. ""Blow 30 mill like I'm Hammer,"" he boasts early on, and he's such a nice guy you hope it is 30 mill--and wish with all your heart he wasn't certain to blow whatever it turns out to be instead.
"
FALSE,B+,Yesterday's Wine,Willie Nelson,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7501,"
The great Nashville songsmith has never bowled anyone over with his singing, and here he finds the concept to match. Since ""perfect man"" has already been and gone, he announces at the outset, ""the voice of imperfect man must now be made manifest, and I have been chosen as the most likely candidate."" Most of these songs--though not the two best, ""Yesterday's Wine"" and ""Me and Paul""--are on religious themes, and on more than one he seems to be playing the part of God's messenger, which tends to limit their general relevance. But if that's how he got to ""These Are Difficult Times,"" maybe it was worth it. Anyway, sometimes his nonsinging bowls me over.
"
FALSE,B+,Shotgun Willie,Willie Nelson,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4169,"
This attempt to turn Nelson into a star runs into trouble when it induces him to outshout Memphis horns or Western swing, and his unaccompanied-acoustic version of ""A Song for You"" takes some getting used to. After a while, though, you notice that you're noticing every song. And then you realize that the two you notice most--the slyly vengeful ""Sad Songs and Waltzes"" and the cuckold's tragedy ""She's Not for You""--are also the two oldest. A star, eh?
"
FALSE,B+,To Lefty from Willie,Willie Nelson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4172,"
Although Nelson earned his legend as a songwriter, he's turning into a singer now that profit-taking time has come--does broaden one. The amazing thing is that he gets away with it. On this heartfelt if opportune farewell to Lefty Frizzell, his cracks and creaks and precisely conversational timing hold their own against the more conventionally exquisite singing of Merle Haggard or Frizzell himself. Of course, the material doesn't hurt.
"
FALSE,B+,Somewhere Over the Rainbow,Willie Nelson,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4178,"
Nelson's best since Stardust isn't quite the rehash it seems to be. The often uptempo music is suffused with Western swing, the standards not all that standard. Which would be great if only Nelson's ecumenicism didn't run in the direction of ""My Mother's Eyes,"" the aforementioned ""Over the Rainbow,"" and a jazzed-up ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.""
"
FALSE,B+,Willie Nelson's Greatest Hits (and Some That Will Be),Willie Nelson,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4177,"
Nelson's strength is hitting a song on the button while glancing off in the other direction, and a compilation is no way to highlight it--the necessarily haphazard structure makes him seem not so much casual as indolent. He needs a little album structure--standards, collaboration, half-assed narrative--to tone things up. Song for song, relaxing; on the whole, mushy.
"
FALSE,B+,American Classic,Willie Nelson,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14664,"
Not Stardust--because nothing is, because standards albums pack no conceptual kick anymore, and because producer Booker T. Jones was venturing into the unknown where producer Tommy LiPuma is just doing his cocktail-jazz tap dance. Still, the consistency of approach and material accentuates Nelson's barely perceptible evolution into not just an uncannily canny singer, not just a subtly swinging singer, but one of the greatest singers alive. He's talky, but he's always had heaps of high end and loads of low, and he's expended his resources so nonchalantly that at 76 he has more voice left than many with twice his natural endowment. He takes songs easy without throwing them away, and these were written to hold up their end of that bargain.

FALSE,B+,Heroes,Willie Nelson,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15845,"
How much you value this entry in the 79-year-old's unchartable catalogue--over and above ""Roll Me Up,"" in which Jamey Johnson, Kris Kristofferson, and none other than Snoop Dogg top off the title with the genius punch line ""and smoke me when I die""--depends on what you make of Willie's 23-year-old son Lukas, who sings on nine of the tracks and wrote three of them. I think one of his originals is aces, one self-sustaining, and one--which naturally goes on for six minutes--the worst thing on the record. But once I learned to distinguish him from the half-century older Billie Joe Shaver, who undercuts the solemn title track with his patented off-the-cuff aplomb, I decided that Lukas's stoned-hillbilly affect was just what his dad needed to distinguish this particular assortment of what-thes, why-hasn't-he-evers, and written-to-orders from rival entries in his unchartable catalogue.
"
FALSE,B+,San Antonio Rose,Willie Nelson & Ray Price,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4176,"
Nelson's groove has resembled a rut since he hit paydirt with Stardust, so give a cheer--maybe he's out of it. Country standards gone vaguely Western swing (in Nashville, without horns), this is nothing startling, but the false steps and lackadaisical jams of the live doubles and the Leon Russell job are gone. Price, who tends to posture in countrypolitan settings, thrives on the relaxed atmosphere. People who don't know the originals are going to fall in love.
"
FALSE,B+,Nervus Rex,Nervus Rex,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5533,"
Lauren Agnelli has gotten noticed ever since she was Trixie A. Balm, but Shaun Brighton is the secret: no matter how much you object to his fruity singing, don't miss his songs. Imagine the Left Banke with Mike Chapman, a sense of humor, and the wherewithal to hold up their own legend. Imagine ""Don't Look"" following up ""Walk Away Renee.""
"
FALSE,B+,Compilation,Michael Nesmith,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7508,"
Nesmith began his career on RCA as a crackpot inventor and ended as a bankrupt cottage industry. The title of his final RCA LP, And the Hits Just Keep On Coming, was more wishful than sarcastic, which is why he's seen to its reissue, as well as that of Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash, another pretty much standard country-song sampler. Seven of the twelve cuts on this compilation (another great title) come from those two albums. The side that concentrates on earlier stuff is an amazing contraption, one piece of zonked Nashville after another. The other side is a pretty much standard-plus display case. Among the missing: ""The Grand Ennui,"" ""Calico Girlfriend,"" ""Mama Nantucket,"" ""The Keys to the Car.""
"
FALSE,B+,Loose Salute,Mike Nesmith & the First National Band,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7505,"
In which Nesmith continues his transmutation into Gram Parsons for television fans, or the Jimmy Rodgers of Sunset Strip. I'm beginning to suspect that he takes his meandering thoughts and marble columns in the sky more seriously than they deserve. But his songwriting gifts are at a peak on this amalgam of gimmicks and mannerisms, long-vowel articles and near-yodels and electronic excursions and alien rhythms. At its best, sublime schlock; at its worst, downhome kitsch.
"
FALSE,B+,Orchid in the Storm,Aaron Neville,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11,"
In which Joel Dorn lets the eerie, quavering shimmer and imperturbable naturalness of Aaron's falsetto run, drift, float, or soar with six '50s covers. The singer avoids the overstated Russell Thompkins mode more wanly than necessary, but with teen dreams from Johnny Ace and the Penguins turned into the essence of timeless romance, the sublimely silly ""Ten Commandments of Love"" sounds like dictation from Mount Sinai.
"
FALSE,B+,Fiyo on the Bayou,The Neville Brothers,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2546,"
Unlike their Jack Nitzsche-produced flop, this one sounds like gumbo--the spirit is willing and the flesh can't resist. Unfortunately, the tunes are so surefire that I long ago memorized the way other Nworlins stalwarts (and Jimmy Cliff) do 'em--in a word, better. An enjoyable way for neophytes to get into the most universal rock and roll style--and a lazy way for oldtimers to convince themselves that the world isn't changing.
"
FALSE,B+,Uptown,The Neville Brothers,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2549,"
Contrary to rumor, the drums are almost all live, but they so rarely venture an offbeat that it's a solecism to call the result commercial funk. It's not crossover because the Nevilles have no black/""urban"" base to cross over from, and no one's claiming it's New Orleans. Nope--between adult themes, solidly insinuating tunes, uncommonly grizzled vocals, and faint indigenous lilt, what we have here is a pretty damn good CHR album. Too bad ""Whatever It Takes"" and ""Midnight Key"" will never prove the durability of their old-love-rekindled and night-lust-unloosed in the crucible of high rotation; too bad ""Shak-a-Na-Na""'s second-linish Brit imagism and ""Old Habits Die Hard""'s Tops-Tempts-Tavares homage aren't gimmicky enough to push some gatekeeper's everything-old-is-new button. Because this risks the unknown just the way the crass dance-fad novelty ""Mardi Gras Mambo"" did in 1954. There's aesthetic tension in its craft and blind ambition, and reason to think it'll sound quirkier and realer than Fiyo on the Bayou another 23 years down the line.

FALSE,B+,New Edition,New Edition,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5536,"
Though a confusion of production teams--five in all, none associated with the ousted Arthur Baker except by ripoff (from Freez's ""I.O.U.,"" very clever)--gives these kids' major-label hit a misbegotten look, in the end the album achieves the winning commercial variety Baker didn't get out of them. But I admit it--for me the biggest winner is ""My Secret,"" which does sound an awful lot like the Jackson 5.
"
FALSE,B+,A-Z,Colin Newman,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5539,"
Projected and rejected as the fourth Wire album, it would have been the right step backwards--regressive only if you consider noise uncouth. Producer Mike Thorne's keyboards are indeed all over the place, but rather than laying down the trancy gloss of 154, they do what they can do to rub a body the wrong way, just like Newman's guitar. Leading me to suspect that the absent Graham Lewis is Wire's new-waving fifth columnist. Of course, Lewis also probably contributes the catchy stuff--where on Pink Flag you remember every allusively desperate little song, here you recognize the oblique, abrasive gestalt. And remember ""B,"" which has no lyrics at all, every time its rousing climax comes around.
"
FALSE,B+,Little Criminals,Randy Newman,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2878,"
Always the master craftsman, Newman doesn't waste a second here, doesn't permit an inept lyrical insight or musical fillip. But over the past three years he doesn't seem to have written one song that ranks with his best. Among all these explorations of America's dirty white underbelly, only the out-and-out jokes--the gross intolerance of ""Short People"" and the Eagles music on ""Rider in the Rain""--distinguish themselves. Very disappointing.
"
FALSE,B+,Born Again,Randy Newman,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2879,"
This has more content and feeling than Little Criminals. But as with Little Criminals its highlight is a (great) joke--""The Story of a Rock and Roll Band,"" which ought to be called ""E.L.O."" and isn't, for the same reason supergroupie radio programmers have shied away from it. Hence, the content comprises ever more intricate convolutions of bad taste; rather than making you think about homophobes and heavy-metal toughs and me-decade assholes the way he once made you think about rednecks and slave traders and high school belles, he makes you think about how he feels about them. Which just isn't as interesting.
"
FALSE,B+,Land of Dreams,Randy Newman,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2881,"
He who lives by the putdown shall die by the putdown, so Newman's first nonsoundtrack album in almost six years is unlikely to increase his renown or his financial holdings. And indeed, it's half mishmash, replete with compulsive irony, rap parody, and spare, hooked love songs that are equally unbelievable happy or sad. But there's a new pitch of displacement to the pseudo-autobiographical triptych at the outset, and a new pitch of bitterness to the scabrous putdowns that highlight the close. The airplay hit ""It's Money That Matters"" and the ""We Are the World"" answer song ""I Want You To Hurt Like I Do"" are the attention-getters. The cruelly laid-back supply-side boogie-woogie ""Roll With the Punches"" and the symphonically overstated going-to-school reminiscence ""Four Eyes"" are the strokes. Inspirational Verse: ""Here's your little brown shoes, can you tie them yourself?""

FALSE,B+,Fine Old Tom,Tom Newman,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7513,"
Tom seems to have recorded this far across the sea in 1975, but more than that even my Anglophile sources can't tell me. Analogies: Dave Edmunds (studiomania and general non-esoteric musical orientation, although Newman isn't interested in overpowering anyone), Ray Davies (vaguely but persistently, for both eccentricity and vocal approach), Eno (more precisely, not only for eccentricity and vocal approach but also for style of smarts, although Newman isn't so blatantly avant-garde). Pretty catchy.
"
FALSE,B+,Thunder and Consolation,New Model Army,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5542,"
The alienation most bands traffic in is a byproduct of moderate privilege--with sustenance a given, they rant or joke or whine or bellow about meaning. This band sings for the true losers. Given their subject/audience, it's no wonder they've been known to make Britcrits fret about fascism--crippled and scattered by Thatcherism, deprived of the belonging the family isn't good for anymore, these ordinary ungifted people could turn into fascism's foot soldiers. Of course, give up on them and that's what you leave them. Identify, empathize, observe, remember, and they've got that much margin.
"
FALSE,B+,1981-1982,New Order,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5543,"
Bargain hunters shouldn't pass up this chance to own ""Temptation"" plus-four for close to the price of the twelve-inch. But I don't call the twelve-inch ""Temptation""/""Hurt"" for the same reason I can't remember which of the four is which after playing them all fifteen times. ""Temptation"" is where Manchester's finest stop hearing ghosts and stake their claim to a danceable pop of unprecedented grimness and power. If it isn't the definition of romantic obsession, it's even richer than I think it is. But it's also the first real song this sharp-cornered sound-and-groove band has ever come up with.
"
FALSE,B+,Movement,New Order,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2553,"
For months I've sworn to concentrate on the lyrics and be done with this goddamn record, but it ain't gonna happen. The singing isn't literally inaudible, but it is literally unprojected, much less noticeable than the surrounding drum, guitar, and synthesizer rhythms/effects. Very atmospheric--the spaceship as sepulcher, with a beat. And as long as I literally don't have to hear their doomy doggerel, not a bad way to go.
"
FALSE,B+,"Power, Corruption and Lies",New Order,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2554,"
The second or third Joy Division II album has occasioned disputation among the faithful. Some claim that it cynically recycles their riffs, while others think it raises that old new music to transcendent summits. Me, I find it relatively gentle and melodic in its ambient postindustrial polyrhythms, their nicest record ever. I also think it sounds pretty much like the others.
"
FALSE,B+,Low Life,New Order,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2555,"
Where once they determined to keep all affect out of their music, now they determine to put some in. Any dance-trance outfit that can lead off its Quincy Jones debut with an oblique ""Love Me Do"" quote has its heart (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) in the right place, so one doesn't want to quibble. But inserting affect isn't the same as actually feeling something, and it isn't the same as expressing (or even simulating) a feeling, either.
"
FALSE,B+,Technique,New Order,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2558,"
The catchy Anglodisco gloom fans have complained about ever since the band lightened up finally arrives, and it's a lot franker and happier (hence smarter) than Depeche Mode. But now that Bernard is a full-fledged human being, we find out he's a slightly boring human being. Is this why he was always in the dumps?
"
FALSE,B+,Electric Version,The New Pornographers,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11972,"
Earns its buzz. Tremendous craft, winning enthusiasm. You'll remember every song when it comes on--maybe even when it doesn't, hum hum. But if it has a point beyond whistling at the void, it declines to mention what that point might be. Also, I wish the sparingly deployed Neko Case would abandon her faux-country career. Carl Newman likes a lot of things about British pop that I don't, starting with vocal filters (his seems built-in) and that cute accent (signifying not class but artifice as a virtue). Is this what Zumpano sounds like? Who cares?
"
FALSE,B+,Challengers,The New Pornographers,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13728,"
Still a band that improves everyone in it, and more forthcoming this time, though they really ought to risk despoiling their precious graphics with lyrics. Carl Newman will always be too formal (do Canadians really say ""hangs in air,"" not ""hangs in the air""?), but when Neko Case steps up to take one of his difficult-love songs, feelings surface--and also the meanings Case's own albums archly avoid. Plus, who would have thought Destroyer Dan Bejar could write an open-skied Manhattan anthem that ventures into Queens? It's ""Myriad Harbour,"" the indie-rock ""New York, New York."" Mark Kozelek could cover it!

FALSE,B+,New Riders of the Purple Sage,New Riders of the Purple Sage,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7514,"
Many find the weakness of John ""Marmaduke"" Dawson's singing an a priori turnoff, but I'm perversely attached to it. This diminutive, definitely mild-mannered c&amp;w fantast betrays (I said betrays) none of the manipulative self-regard that marks the true wimp, and his voice suits the folkie-hippie casualness of the band's ""country""-""rock."" A feckless myth, to be sure--trucking women and heroic dopers, gentle aspiration and mysterious evil. But a charming and tuneful one.

FALSE,B+,Romantech,New York Gypsy All Stars,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16683,"
Released late 2011, this debut by a post-Balkan quintet built around Macedonian-born clarinet genius Ismael Lumanovski and knocked around by irrepressible Berklee-trained Turkish drummer Engin Kaan Gunaydin lags after a strong start and then races to the finish line for 25 minutes or so. Not that it's always speedy--""Outcry"" adds some gravity just when it's needed. But the closing ""EZ-Pass"" definitely makes a beeline for the no cash lane.

Ramboe used to be Nightmare Alley's rhythm guitarist, and since his Ratbags comprise bass and drums from his old band, I suggest he return to that position with expanded responsibilities. His postliterate wit (""When you got 'em by the balls you got their hearts and minds"") and referential rock and roll (""Give My Regards to Broadway""?) are cut from the same cloth, and maybe if he and Frank Ruscitti traded vocals, making this an album instead of a double EP, they'd achieve that mysterious simulation of musicality that induces radio's overseers to program wise guys. Then again, maybe they wouldn't--Ramboe is pretty tuneless, Ruscitti pretty tense.

For those benighted who still believe the original can't sing, here's a sweeter version, including appropriately lovely versions of two rare urban celebrations--""Vine Street"" (the one that led off Van Dyke Parks's Song Cycle) and ""Dayton, Ohio 1903."" Not so dynamic musically, though--just Nilsson singing, and Newman behind on piano.

Those who are taken with Nilsson the sweet, slightly kooky popmeister will approve of this reliable compilation--probably even dig Gordon Jenkins on ""As Time Goes By."" Those who are attracted to the popmeister by his apparent insanity will play it only in their most conservative moments.
"
FALSE,B+,Son of Schmilsson,Harry Nilsson,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7524,"
Nilsson functions on the edge of parody--his best stuff succeeds simultaneously as a kind of takeoff and as a genuinely moving example of the genre that has inspired him. Unfortunately, most of this album, which follows so close on the heels of his biggest commercial success that Nilsson (natch) makes a joke of it in the title, is too often merely funny or strange. This is wonderful as far as it goes. But those three or four songs that are much better than that suffer by association. Inspirational Verse: ""You're breakin'; my heart/You're tearin' it apart/So fuck you.""

Though it pulls up lame midway through side two and resorts to rape jokes that piss on the memory of Howlin' Wolf and for that matter Wolfman Jack, this album is as rude as it wants to be. Where competing raunch hands end at obscenity, Mojo starts there and moves on, saving his most raucous loathing for songs like ""I Hate Banks"" (and he don't mean Ernie or the Mississippi) and ""Ain't Got No Boss"" (""This is a personal phone call"").

Pop anarchobeatnikism has its political attractions--hard to argue when a college band calls for mall-burning even if the moment isn't historically propitious. But if Mojo thinks freedom's just another word for passing me on the shoulder in a traffic jam, let him try it--I'll veer right and proceed at exactly the same speed as our fellow citizen-sufferers, which I know from experience will make their day as much as it'll piss Mojo off. And if Mojo rams me in extended adolescent frustration, I'll sue his ass for the rights to ""Stuffin' Martha's Muffin."" Always did think those royalties should redound to National Rape Crisis Headquarters.

Art statements like ""Wash No Dishes No More"" and ""I Ain't Gonna Piss in No Jar"" can't be laughed off these days. ""Elvis Is Everywhere"" is for Phil Ochs in heaven, and by laying down cassette-and-CD-only tracks worth hearing they face up to their formal problem--making irresponsibility new. Not only would the agape-riven ""Don't Want No Foo-Foo Haircut on My Head"" and the primordial ""Story of One Chord"" fit quite audibly onto twelve inches of vinyl, they'd enlighten Mojo's collegiate followers. This cannot be said of the Americana-mongering ""We Gotta Have More Soul!"" and ""B.B.Q. U.S.A.,"" much less Skid's ""Lincoln Logs,"" in which the poor folkie misses his boyhood toys boo hoo.

FALSE,B+,Outburst,The Nomads,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3739,"
Why is this neogarage band better than all other neogarage bands? Admittedly, it could just be taste in covers--Alex Chilton and Sleepy John Estes as well as the Kinks and the eternal Standells. And it could be appetite for covers--eight all told leave room for only four overly generic originals. But it certainly helps that they're from Sweden--means their preference for American music is democratic rather than chauvinistic and adventurous rather than sentimental.

From ""Life's not a bitch, she's just sick of being personified"" to ""I attended candlelight vigils for Matthew Shepard/While you put out another fucking faggot record,"" Sage Francis seems sage enough, aesthetically and politically. But he's also the kind of hip-hopper who boasts, ""I go to Fugazi shows requesting Minor Threat songs""--an old school purist insofar as he's a hip-hopper at all, with woman problems for club cred. So a nice round of applause for Joe Beats, whose fresh new sounds and spare old beats make ""life of the search party,"" ""scent of death threats,"" and ""fairygodmotherfucker"" seem like wordplay rather than the one-upmanship that is Francis's reason for rapping.

Although I give them points for stick-to-it-iveness and good cheer, their records have always struck me as complacent because even the subtlest r&amp;b has a more pronounced backbeat. But on his second try, drummer Tom Ardolino makes a marginal but telling difference--the performance is urgent, intense, up, so that even given their adolescent romantic preoccupations (life on the road, it keeps you young) the songs take on a complex life worthy of their chord changes. And try Terry Adams's Jimi-meets-Thelonious clavinet on ""Talk to Me.""

I'm gratified that three out of four successive songs on side two--""Chores,"" ""This Old House,"" and ""Things We Like to Do""--mention problems of home maintenance, albeit invidiously (I put off the vacuuming myself).

Anybody with a taste for mbube's droll complexities, especially those who find Ladysmith too sweet (the pleasures some people deny themselves for tough-mindedness's sake), will get a kick out of this alternative.

Anybody who gets misty-eyed about the MC-5 owes it to himself (or herself, believe it or not) to ponder this Detroit boy's, well, let's call it his sexual rhetoric, which was virtually invented by the White Panthers. Maybe the when-in-doubt-whip-it-out of ""Stranglehold"" and ""Wang Dang Sweet Poontang"" and ""Free for All"" are only metaphors, but as metaphors, well, let's just say they suck. And having done so, let's add with only slightly guilty pleasure that his musclebound gooniness is a hoot. It's an evasion to pass him off as a harmless joke, but it's a distortion to pretend that he or anyone in his audience takes his bullshit more than half seriously. From flash guitar to locomotive beat to secret tunes, he's an unreconstructed '60s survivor--the hippie-biker as feral sex fiend, terror of countless timid ninnies and nice people. One way or another, well, let's just say I get off on everything here, with the slobbering ""Wango Tango"" a special favorite. Rock and roll!

FALSE,B+,Replicas,Gary Numan & Tubeway Army,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1343,"
Resistant as I am to the new strain of synthesizer punk now reaching us from England, I didn't connect to this for months--not until I listened to the singing. Numan's lyrics abound with aliens and policemen and pickups in what sounds at first like the worst sort of received decadence, but his monotone is too sweet and vulnerable for that impression to stick. To you it may be sordid sex and middlebrow sci-fi; to him it's romance and horror. The debut (Tubeway Army, Beggar's Banquet import) is faster, more pointed, and includes no instrumentals. This is catchier, more haunted, and includes two.

Four eight-minute dance tracks plunked down into a standard African (also disco) album format, this features the almost feminine tenor of the leader of Zaire's Orchestre les Kamal������������������, but it's made by the guitar parts.

This is virtually an encyclopedia of N.Y.C. dance music--no microchips anywhere carry so much verve, sex, or grit. Only in N.Y.C., however, do people dance a whole lot to encyclopedias, and I fear that if ""Don't Make Me Wait"" didn't convert the great out-there then the rest of this is doomed to a life of obscurity.

FALSE,B+,Stop the Clocks,Oasis,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15635,"
One of the many things I never got about this band was where the Beatles were. Where was the ebullience, the wit, the harmonies, God just the singing, and, uh, the songwriting? Cotton Mather made me understand that when Oasis say they love the Beatles they really mean they love the post-Help!, pre-Sgt. Pepper Beatles. Since that span encompasses Rubber Soul and Revolver, many would say tally ho, but (a) not me 'cause I love the Beatles start to finish and (b) only if you're writing songs as good as, uh, ""We Can Work It Out."" Instead Oasis, meaning loudmouth bro Noel Gallagher, write songs that resemble ""We Can Work It Out"" in thickened texture and momentum but not depth or charm, then add arena size in the swagger of the drums and the bigged-up vocals themselves. This band-selected best-of--two discs lasting 87 minutes, like an old-fashioned double-LP except it's only 18 tracks--capture their sonic moment as fully as any freelance music historian needs. A 2010 package repeats 11 of these songs and adds 16 others--too many, I say. Also, it omits the opening ""Rock 'n' Roll Star."" If ever there were guys whose message to the world is summed up by an opener called ""Rock 'n' Roll Star,"" it's these bigheads.

I didn't pay much heed to complaints that this album cheated Nigeria's other big juju star by fading his hot tracks early. After all, juju isn't supposed to begin and end the way mbaqanga or Europop does--songs are designed to segue together for nonstop dancing. And there are notable themes and spectacular sounds throughout. But since they never assert a collective identity, cheating Americans of the wholeness they look for in African music, I have to assume the fades are at least partly at fault.

FALSE,B+,Blond/Blonde,Frank Ocean,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16878,"
This indifferent melodist's coup d'art only comes into its own when he brings the noise--especially as of the clamorous ""Nights,"" which together with the 100-mph Andre 3000 rap and the rehearsal-tuneup chorale that follow add up to the only nine minutes on his stairway to nowhere that I'd call thrilling as well as admirable. Sometimes it's deeply admirable, true, like for instance the candidly awkward ""Good Guy,"" the telling ""Facebook Story"" tale, and Ocean's determination to rely on the musical authority of his expressive and capable but unathletic voice--I love the way ""Good Guy"" Auto-Tunes down. As on Channel Orange, however, his angst is a luxury of leisure--his wealth, hold the fame. Because some of his interpersonals could happen to anyone, his fans relate, and good for him. But most are specific to his social status. Why doesn't he whine more about the travails of stardom? Because he knows damn well how much he enjoys the freedom it affords him.

Without a doubt this is subtler and more durable than most slow, long-winded records, and half of it is terrific. She has her own sound, her simulated plainspeech strikes a blow for directness and honesty without committing her to any one thing, and if you think ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" cuts Taylor Dayne on the radio, wait till you hear ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" cut Aerosmith. Not since Patti Smith has anybody had a better chance of defining rock-not-pop in a specifically female way--she's just the right mess of emotion and savvy, crudity and sophistication, fury and independence and love. If there's anything that's older news than a 20-year-old who's angry at the world, it's a 23-year-old who's discovered life is worth living. But all that means is that if she can withstand the media flood, this won't be all that hard to top. How can she possibly know what she wants when she's only 23?

A/k/a Boogity-Shoogity, and I don't mean to be mean--I quite like these guys in limited doses. There are even good slow ones here. What's more, it's their funniest album ever, and that's no typo. Only I can't quite convince myself that artistic development is even a category for a group that is clearly pure Act if not pure Product. What I can do, however, is be glad that they make Earth, Wind &amp; Fire sound like the Herbie Mann Singers.

The title cut is single of the year, so I'm not surprised that it's unequaled here, but I wish something came close. Most will opt for ""Love Train,"" a propulsive flagwaver attached to UNESCO lyrics about people all over the world joining hands, presumably so they can't stab each other in the you-know-where. Me, I prefer the follow-up, ""992 Arguments,"" but ""I'm a Man"" or ""Baby Love"" it's not--more like ""It's the Same Old Song.""

If I were more conversant with the infinite shadings of African pop, I might get a sharper buzz off Okosun's panstylistic Afro-reggae, and I might be ready to settle for reassuring uplift if the two chants on Heartbeat's Black Star Liner sampler had been reserved for his U.S. debut. But as things stand, this sounds a little soft to me, just like the universalist-influenced politics that go with it. The curse of not-Marley strikes again.

For an African groove to buoy those of us who haven't been swimming in it since childhood, it has to be articulated in distinct detail, which is why I thank the engineers who popped each element out this time. Agile horn arrangements from a man called Dave also stir it up. As on Okosuns's Shanachie compilation, the lyrics (all but ""My Ancestors"" in English) are kind-hearted, militantly progressive, and a little simple--maybe too much so when he's following Nigeria's new leaders.

Dallas boys don't come to country naturally, not Dallas boys honest enough to open: ""This is the story of Victoria Lee/She started off on Percodan and ended up with me/She lived in Berkeley till the earthquake shook her loose/She lives in Texas now where nothing ever moves."" So ""You Belong to My Heart"" and ""My Sweet Blue-Eyed Darlin'"" fall as flat as their titles, and ""W-I-F-E"" says more about their own wimmin problems than about those of the ethos they poach so pseudosatirically. But in the back of a Bel Air with a mouthful of some girl's hair, staring at the dressing room walls blaming King Reagan for their wimmin problems, they're an uncommonly pungent bunch of alt-rockers with a sound they'll beef up yet.

They get depressed a lot, actually, so what say we lump them in with the new literalism, more Ass Ponys than Uncle Tupelo. Even if Rhett Miller really thinks love always turns out as bad as it does here--hell, even if he thinks third-rate romance is just a metaphor for the musician's lot--I still give him credit for keeping his eyes open. Convincer: ""Barrier Reef,"" which renders the high hopes and depressing mechanics of a critical one-night stand in equally quick and devastating strokes.

Well after you realize they have no business covering ""Rocks Off"" because they're not the Rolling Stones, ""Rocks Off"" continues to rock. Then there's a Fratellis song about fandom rescued from Britfan oblivion, an early R.E.M. song with every word enunciated by lit guy Rhett Miller, and David Bowie's greatest song with the possible exception of ""TVC-15"" (which, really now, isn't the Old 97's' kind of thing).

Floating airy synthesizers on the quietest of Paris-Kinshasa grooves, this Papa Wemba grad is class pop right down to his haircut. A balladeer by soukous standards, he's a rhythm king nevertheless, a cafe au lait Bing Crosby with the stuff to shoot from the hips. But for all its gentle carnality, his seductive one-on-one lacks emotional detail if you don't understand the words. Fluent Francophones will swoon--especially fluent female Francophones.

This took a lot longer to break through in the living room than it would have on the dance floor, so homebodies be patient. What makes the difference in the end is that Jam &amp; Lewis are letting their love man play the nasty guy--""Fake"" and ""Criticize"" take the offensive after ""Hearsay"" puts it sweetly. And unlike Jam &amp; Lewis's nasty girl, O'Neal has the vocal muscle (and biceps) to back his nasty up. What's more, the same muscle turns ""Sunshine"" into a confection you could take home to mother.

Middle America tells itself stories about normal life. The flourishes are too big and the musical colors too bright, the teller of tales a blonde looker who reaches out to heroic mommies and slaves of data entry and praises the company of girlfriends without abandoning her search for the perfect man. It's ""like trying to find Atlantis,"" but somewhere in there she does. ""I Love My Life,"" she concludes, and you can almost see how some normal person might. Not the truth--far from it. But not quite a lie. Probably because she's not middle-American at all. Australia--the promised land.

Prepunk and for that matter prepub, Peter Perrett may well have been an only one, and he fits in now only because this is such a tolerant and/or commercially desperate time. He's not ""power pop,"" of course--on record, at least, power's got nothing to do with it. With his lazy drawl tightrope-walking on the cusp of the love-death continuum, he's just a perversely if not insincerely wistful rock and roll balladeer who hopes you'll sleep with him and will get peeved if you don't--vulnerably seductive now, but don't be surprised if he quickly starts demanding specialties.

FALSE,B+,La Belle �����,Orchestra Baobab,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15733,"
This two-CD import has many discographical drawbacks. The adequate audio on the first disc, all or most of which was recorded live without audience in an empty club, could be more forceful and distinct. It shares the preponderance of its second disc with Nick Gold's On Verra ������������������a comp and a few tracks with the somewhat superior archive dig N'Wolof. Individual selections have been reinterpreted on Baobab's reunion CDs, picked up on this or that Afrocomp, and/or recycled on cheesier reissues. So as an economic matter this iteration of their early recordings, trending Latin and also often featuring Laye M'Boup--al""Yen Saay,"" which does have a studio sheen--may seem a redundant extravagance to some old fans. If so, however, I urge them to seek out not just ""Yen Saay"" but the gorgeous ""Baobab Gouye Gui""/""Geeja Ngala Riir""/""Samaxol Fatou Diop"" sequence, preceding it with ""Jarraf"" if they don't know N'Wolof, where it's called ""Yaraf.""

Clearly a first-rank band, they were also clearly a band without a true star on vocals or guitar. Since beyond a single drummer their music was all vocals and guitars, this is a limitation. Nor does the songcraft help much. So this lovingly conceived, skillfully engineered reconstruction from the big-holed, two-sided originals provides nine slightly subclassic soukous tracks averaging eight-and-a-half minutes apiece--in the East African manner, of course, which is less coruscating than its Congolese counterparts. Samba Mapangala does take the lead once, and it's fine listening throughout. But it's definitely for adepts of the style. Mastermind Doug Paterson's thorough notes include summaries of Lingala lyrics that are more woman-friendly than Afropop so often is.

FALSE,B+,Don't Stop,Jeffrey Osborne,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5581,"
Osborne proves that the secularization of black pop needn't mean the end of a great vocal tradition, only of its church roots, and he doesn't sing as if he learned how at Performing Arts, either. Instead he sounds like what he is--a son of the most uncompromised black secular music, funk. The slightly herky-jerk bent of his phrasing and pronunciation is geared to the rhythm, and when he bears down into a ballad he sounds fresher than more conventionally soulful singers. Of course, he also sounds stranger if you're not prepared, which is why the uninitiated will take more readily to the somewhat stronger material on Stay With Me Tonight. Me, I just got the message, and I've been playing both.

In-concert compilations are often incoherent, but the blues-style hard jive beloved of performer-turned-majordomo Otis has such formal integrity that this r&amp;b spectacular moves smoothly for four sides. Some of the featured players are no more than Otis's hired hands, including guitarist Shuggie O. But (in ascending order) Roy Milton, Big Joe Turner, Ivory Joe Hunter, Little (?)

Subtract the seven Aquemini and Stankonia tracks from this best-of and you're left with only one that could compete with them--the more-song-than-rap single ""The Whole World."" Everything else, including two other new tracks, streamlines the tangle-rooted funk of their must-own albums into a discernibly Southern G-funk that meditates on the constraints of life outside the law: hit-the-streets pep talk, Christmas carol, the shallow-as-its-title title track ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,"" and my favorite, the languid ""Crumblin' Herb,"" about doing what you can while you're still alive to inhale it. More pleasurable than most gangsta hedonism, yes--and all the early OutKast most will ever need.

The two rock and roll covers are unbelievably clumsy coming from country's great lost missing link, and not just rhythmwise--did he choose the teen protest ""Summertime Blues"" because his gerontologist thought it would do wonders for him? Nor are many of the originals worthy of the career-capping compilation I hope is on the way. But he has a lesson to teach both his cocky epigones (emotion and commitment) and his exhausted contemporaries (emotion and commitment '88). Sounds like he's learned some things, too--from premier contemporary George Jones, whose late work had the same phlegmy maturity and every-syllable-counts concentration until the emotion and commitment went out of him.

The attraction is a Luo elder named Joseph Nyamungu, who plays a droning, mbira-sounding eight-stringed lyre called the nyatiti and sings with built-in momentum and gruff command. His five tracks are all exciting in different ways, solo showcase included. The other five falter in direct correlation to how prominently they feature the white Londoners who brought Nyamungu and the rest of their Kenyan bandmates into the great world, with the all-Londoner instrumental ""Nabed Nade El Piny Ka--Rework (How Will I Love in This World)"" the nadir (and the Kenyan version of the same song on the somewhat ramshackle Sofrito: International Soundclash comp vastly superior). Kenyan beats carry two English-language songs in which one Londoner reflects on some aspect of modernity I can't make out and another expresses his all-too-patient love. Guest patron Damon Albarn's Farfisa wilds out on the Kenyan-dominated ""Odera Lwar"" before his Omnichord further dulls ""Margaret Okudo--Dub."" I know, this is all too schematic. Unfortunately, it's true. Also true: you'll love that nyatiti.

With the heretofore useless John Miles doing Plant (you barely notice when the man himself sneaks in for a song) and the heretofore unproven Jason Bonham doing Daddy (assuming Page isn't sampling Boom-Boom like everybody else, flesh and blood being no substitute for the real simulacrum in today's studio), side one is easily the best Zep rip ever recorded. Zep blooze, not Zep mythopoeia, with titles like ""Wasting My Time"" and ""Wanna Make Love""; Page's riffs are classic, which isn't to say anybody has or hasn't played them before, and the momentum is fierce and enormous. On side two the mostly ridiculous Chris Farlowe takes over, his unlistenable ""Hummingbird"" inspiring fond thoughts of Leon Russell. Jimmy and Jason should form a band, invite Plant as a courtesy, and hope he turns them down. If Miles won't do what he's told, Lenny Wolf will be happy to step in.

Two or three great songs and a fair number of pretty good ones--I'm especially partial to ""Karate,"" a bash-his-face wife-abuse song that deserves more attention than it's been getting, and ""Those Crazy Christians,"" where Paisley fulfills his God quotient by stating his distance so admiringly it'll do evangelicalism more good than an entire sacred album. But a lot of the time he's trying too hard to say too little or trying too clumsily to say too much, sometimes even with his trusty guitar. And the LL Cool J rap is just a flat-out embarrassment.

In which Parker finally justifies his abandonment of rock and roll outcry for self-referential studiocraft by more or less acknowledging the private sources of his bitterest protests. The male chauvinism he mocks in the opener is almost certainly his own, and the love he can't take for granted right afterwards is probably his wife's, which in the end proves more durable than he's afraid it will. That's why he's glad to have a glass jaw, why he's advised to ignore everything that sounds like chains, and why except for one misplaced complaint side two is a happy-to-ironic-to-credibly-sappy paean to a marriage that has lasted--talk about your miracle a minute--one whole year.

Parker's mild-mannered description of what happens to those stingy with, er, respect--""You might come home early and get your feelings hurt""--typifies his understated autofunk. Playing guitar, synthesizer, piano, and drums as well as his home bass, which doesn't sound like a lead instrument either, he serves up eight tunes that bump and/or swoon into ear and/or ass with undeniable and virtually unrecallable effectiveness. I like every one, really. But don't ask me which is which--or why it matters.

Parks is a naughty choirboy and Kathy Dalton is auditioning for the Broadway lead, but theatrical preciosity is all you can expect from a musical comedy concept album anyway.

The message seems to be that clones are cool, and the proof seems to be the predictable yet effective funktoons that dominate the album. But I remain an unreconstructed Yurrupean rationalist/individualist, and I wish there were a few more tracks as specific as ""Dr. Funkenstein"" and ""Sexy Body.""

Because it mixes music from all three George Clinton creations (including a new chant) and conveys a lot of the anarchic, participatory throb of a P. Funk concert, this live double serves a real function. But the recording doesn't do much justice to the music's bottom, or its top.

At its stoopidest (""Theme From the Black Hole,"" which features a ""toast to the boogie"" that goes--naturally--""Bottoms up!"") this makes Motor-Booty Affair sound like The Ring of the Nibelungenlied. But at its dumbest (""Party People,"" apparently a sincere title) it makes Motor-Booty Affair sound like ""Sex Machine"" or ""Get Off Your Ass and Jam."" And there's too much filler.

In which Parsons stakes his claim to everything he loves about country music--its bathos, its moral fervor, its sense of peril. Whether he's replicating these qualities in his own songs or finding them in the genuine article, his interpretations achieve the synthesis of skepticism and longing that drove him to devise country-rock in the first place. Physically, he isn't always up to what he knows--that's a folkie's voice cracking on ""She""--but he can be proud that the only track here that beats Tompall Glaser's ""Streets of Baltimore"" is his own ""Kiss the Children.""

I don't know why it took eight years, but after several botches on A&amp;M here it is, a satisfying live-posthumous from the inventor of country-rock, for which he is not to blame. All five A-songs are more forceful on GP, but these versions (recorded in downhome Hempstead, Long Island) have a grace and lightness that for once show off the advantages of folkie roots, as does the new stuff on side two.

FALSE,B+,My Tennessee Mountain Home,Dolly Parton,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1057,"
This concept album begins with the letter Dolly wrote her mom and dad when she was first pursuing her dreams on Music Row. Fortunately, its subject isn't Music Row, except by contrast. Unfortunately, its pastoral nostalgia, while always charming, is sometimes a little too pat. Sentimental masterpieces like the title track are no easier to come by than any other kind, and the slowed-down remake of ""In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)""--the early hit in which she declined to go back--doesn't add as much bite as this city boy needs.

Emphasizing Dolly's perky, upbeat side, this doesn't offer a single must-hear track, but it's remarkably consistent. Songs like ""When the Sun Goes Down Tomorrow"" (country girl goes home) and ""Preacher Tom"" (saving in the name of the Lord) reprise old themes with specificity and verve, and the covers from Emmylou Harris and Merle Haggard broaden her perspective without compromising it. Intensely pleasant.

How you respond to this quasi-concept album about (of all things) work, which offers exquisitely sung standards from Mel Tillis, Merle Travis, and (I swear it) Woody Guthrie as well as Parton originals almost as militant as the title hit, depends on your tolerance for fame-game schlock.

By devoting herself to Nelson Riddle and operetta, Sun City scab Linda Ronstadt has made boycotting painless, but her long-promised hookup with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris will be hard to resist if the vocal luxuries of the mainstream biz make you swoon. Acoustic country delving from ""Farther Along"" and Jimmie Rodgers to Kate McGarrigle and Linda Thompson, it's a slightly scholarly yet sometimes thrilling apotheosis of harmony--three voices that have triumphed in the winner-take-all of the marketplace making a go of cooperation. Free of tits, glitz, and syndrums for the first time in a decade, Parton's penetrating purity dominates the one-off as it once did country music history. The only one of the three who's had the courage of her roots recently, Harris sounds as thoughtful up front as she does in the backup roles that are her forte. And while Linda's plump soprano will always hint of creamed corn, she's a luscious side dish in this company.

FALSE,B+,Pacific Trim,Pavement,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2705,"
Not a maxisingle--an EP consisting entirely of recommended arcana, with the bonus of lyrics that actually (seem to) make sense. But note these stats: three songs totaling 7:44 for $6.98, with the prize-winning ""Gangsters &amp; Pranksters"" finishing at precisely 1:30. Why do you think they call it discretionary income?
"
FALSE,B+,2 Hot!,Peaches & Herb,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5634,"
Anyone who believes all black pop is ""disco,"" nothing more and nothing less, should analyze the outfront vocals and submerged grooves of this enthusiastically lascivious Freddie Perren trifle, which broke because disco DJs are willing to program whatever's danceable, not because AM DJs are willing to program whatever's listenable. And in the end it proved so listenable that ""Reunited"" established itself as an anachronistic smooch classic--the counterpart of ""Shake Your Groove Thing,"" a timely hoochy-cooch classic.

FALSE,B+,Twice the Fire,Peaches & Herb,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5635,"
There's not a bad cut on this album, and though there isn't a great one either I'll settle for ""Howz-about Some Love,"" the Sunshine Band song of the year, ""Roller-Skatin' Mate,"" the dance craze song of the year, and ""Love Lift,"" the neologistic song of the year. Boogaly-boop to you.

FALSE,B+,Pearl Harbor & the Explosions,Pearl Harbor & the Explosions,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5636,"
A rhythm band ought to have a better rhythm section--most of this rocks OK for DOR, but the funk beneath ""Get a Grip on Yourself,"" for instance, is stiff to no purpose. The riffs are hooky, though, and Pearl E. Gates is an independent--not to say insular--woman who knows what her habits cost. There are no tears on her pillow and she doesn't care if your aim is true, but she doesn't waste her energy on macha bluster, either--prefers the cutting remark and isn't above turning her wit on herself. Which does not mean she has any intention of ""reforming.""

FALSE,B+,I Can't Stand the Rain,Ann Peebles,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5637,"
After two hot albums that didn't sell and a smoldering single that did, Peebles slides into the best-selling Al Green groove and doesn't quite catch fire. Reason: neither her raw honey timbre nor her bright, direct personality give her much access to Green's incendiary guile. Salvation: the Hi rhythm team.
"
FALSE,B+,Tribb to JB,The Peeps of Soulfunk,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13831,"
Chuck D or no Chuck D, an album of James Brown covers has built-in limitations, the inexhaustibility of the originals prominent among them. But the live band proves equal to Brown's grooves, and hip-hop established his adaptability long ago. So the record respects the man enough to interpret and even amend him. Here be prologues and scratches, a woman giving ""Man's World"" what for and an elementary-school girl reciting ""King Heroin."" Best of all, here be a ""Make It Funky"" that names as many of Mr. Brown's works and disciples as Chuck can fit in.
"
FALSE,B+,Life Is a Song Worth Singing,Teddy Pendergrass,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3423,"
Romantic schlock at its sexiest and most honest. Pendergrass is in such control of his instrument that the more commonplace of the Sigma Sound orchestrations never spoil the mood, while the good ones--let's hear it for the sax breaks on ""Only You""--accent it the way they're supposed to. The key is that he's not belting much--except for one dull party number, everything is medium-tempo or slower. Pendergrass has a tendency to bluster when he belts, to come on too strong. The slow stuff--these aural seductions are hardly ""ballads""--plays up his vulnerability and gives his vocal textures room to breathe a little.
"
FALSE,B+,Workin' It Back,Teddy Pendergrass,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5599,"
Forget platonic love--this is platonic sex. I mean, the man is the best-known paraplegic in America; when he sings songs called ""Never Felt Like Dancin'"" or utters lines like ""The thought of your body has got me erect,"" their status as mere collections of signs is understood literally by his fans. And thus their status as fantasy can be approached literally as well. Helps that while only ""Love 4/2"" is up to, let us say, vintage Jerry Butler, just about every cut at least maintains the atmosphere. Also helps that he's transferred his vocal savvy to however much of his body he's got left.
"
FALSE,B+,Broadcasting From Home,Penguin Cafe Orchestra,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5601,"
Marginal differences count for plenty with these subtlety specialists. More emphatic production bespeaks sharper conception--sometimes dramatic, sometimes representational, sometimes self-consciously atmospheric. The music is ""better""--and therefore relatively (marginally) conventional. It's lost its incidental aura, and despite the instant appeal of compositions like ""Heartwind"" and ""Music for a Found Harmonium,"" an edge of charm.
"
FALSE,B+,The Art of Walking,Pere Ubu,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2722,"
It's impossible to wish these utopian singers of the industrial pastorale anything but the best. But between the passages of synthesizer buzz and the fond talk of birdies, fishies, and horsies (pace Patti, they do call it ""Horses""), you have to figure that neither Red Crayola's Mayo Thompson (in for Tom Herman) nor the one true God (David is now a Jehovah's Witness) is counseling anybody to rock out. Undestructive violence is a hard act to continue.
"
FALSE,B+,Ubu Live: Volume 1: 390 Degrees of Simulated Stereo,Pere Ubu,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5602,"
Recapping the Hearthan and Blank Records period that a born-again Crocus Behemoth will never look in the eye again, this is a find for fans who missed the early singles and the Datapanik EP (source of four songs, with another previously unreleased and seven more from The Modern Dance). Material and performance are fine, with variant lyrics and new guitar and synthesizer bits mitigating (though not eliminating) the redundancy factor. But most of these recordings were intended for reference only, and that's how they sound--devoid of aural presence. For demo addicts, tape traders, and incorrigible cultists like me.
"
FALSE,B+,Song of the Bailing Man,Pere Ubu,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5603,"
In his Jehovah's Witness phase--which could last the rest of his life--David Thomas is just like any other eccentric ""progressive."" With Mayo Thompson and Anton Fier replacing Ubu's two committed rockers on guitar and drums, the group can't carry him along on populist pulse anymore, which means that although Thomas's compositional ideas may be ""original"" and ""interesting""--and unlike most art-rock, this music deserves both adjectives--how compelling you find the gestalt depends on the power of Thomas's private obsessions. Once again the man outdoes himself--some of these lyrics actually read as poetry. But it's minor poetry for sure--his musings on the ineluctable wonder of the natural order go deeper than, say, Peter Hammill's damn fool doomsaying, but they're long on whimsy and short on tension. As Christian rock goes, it's smart stuff, but as Christian art goes I'll take Graham Greene.
"
FALSE,B+,The World Won't End,The Pernice Brothers,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6248,"
His title poised between wise promise and grim prediction, Joe Pernice chooses life because he can't stop the music, which last time conjured Hollies and this time channels Zombies--Odessey and Oracle, to be precise. Whiners with a knack for melody regularly make hay off admitting the girl was too good for them. Just buy my songs, they promise, and I'll prove I've learned my lesson, for now I can love. With thematic input from one of those girls, Pernice rests his stronger case on dulcet vocals bursting with emotion and melodies whose credulous surge inundates all references to suicide and such. I'm almost convinced. But not quite.
"
FALSE,B+,How the West Was Won,Peter Perrett,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17099,"
Rousing himself from a six-minute opener as shapeless as another nodder's stupor, the original Only One delivers a revealing collection of new songs in the adenoidal singsong he trademarked in his twenties and miraculously retains at 65. Blaming his inept life on society's cruelty to bison and laboratory rats (the lucky ones, he believes, get to starve themselves to death on crack), he swears an eternal love it's not at all clear he can follow through on. His biography, however, suggests otherwise--he's long been married to a designer as COPD-damaged as he is. Not a pretty picture. But a catchy and educational one.
"
FALSE,B+,Mystic Miracle Star,"Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and the Majestics",1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5605,"
Found the hypnogroove a little flat even for a Clash producer's reggae record until I discovered that the Majestics' bottom was two guys named LaVilla and Schwartz. But if they're more rock than rockers, they're perfect for the legendary Perry, who does a mean Dylan on harp and whose crazed rhyming puns and mystagogical patter sound like Marcus Garvey on Highway 61. Move over Jesu, here come Jah.
"
FALSE,B+,The Movie,Persian Gulf,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5607,"
Barking out lyrics loud and clear over an uncommonly forthright groove, Hal Shows led this band to a left-field EP debut two years back, and I wish he'd tried to repeat, because at album length his forthrightness gets out of hand. The world his best lyrics create isn't what the band's music makes it seem--it's an untrustworthy place where being a little crazy can help you get by, full of implicit regrets and sidelong insults and allusions that mean more than they add up to. But when he tries to spell things out in protest or satire, or boil them down into haiku, he seems less than a little crazy.
"
FALSE,B+,We Came to Play,The Persuasions,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5651,"
""You should never try to put a tuxedo on the funky blues,"" reads Richard Penniman's epigraph, but that doesn't mean they should go naked: Jimmy Hayes's bass pulse may be a wonder, but it isn't a trap set. The studio work here captures their live blend, but that's not quite enough--every lyric, melody, arrangement, and lead has to rank with those of ""Man, Oh Man"" or ""Walk on the Wild Side"" for an acappella album to call you back.
"
FALSE,B+,Spread the Word,The Persuasions,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3748,"
The offhand concept announced by the title--gospel and its dissemination--doesn't come out as sentimental as you might expect. Not counting ""The Lord's Prayer,"" the only straight gospel song here is ""When Jesus Comes,"" a millenarian vision that seems rather vague after the more detailed (and profane) utopia described in ""When I Leave These Prison Walls."" ""The Ten Commandments of Love,"" ""Heaven Help Us All,"" and ""Hymn #9"" (a Vietnam junkie song recommended to John Prine) all translate church metaphor into secular maxim, while ""Lean on Me"" and ""Without a Song"" apotheosize the pious commonplace. ""T.A. Thompson"" reveres a rev. And Bob Dylan's ""Three Angels""--one of the dopiest songs about religion ever written--is here transformed into apt intro and reprise.
"
FALSE,B+,Chirpin',The Persuasions,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3749,"
Those who agree with the group's in-it-for-love producer David Dashev that this disc is ""definitive"" find Jerry Lawson's deadpan interpretation of Tony Joe White's ""Willie and Laura Mae Jones"" and Joe Russell's solo claim on ""To Be Loved"" more resonant than I do. But I am impressed by the acappella anthem ""Lookin' for an Echo"" and the way they sustain ""Women and Drinkin'"" for seven minutes, and I really like the easy stuff: ""Papa Oom Mow Mow"" and ""Sixty Minute Man.""
"
FALSE,B+,Comin' at Ya,The Persuasions,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5655,"
The least ""contemporary"" record they've ever essayed--except for ""Love Me Like a Rock,"" all the material dates back to when their acappella style was a genuine urban folk response to what was on the radio--is uniformly listenable. It's also their first for this bluegrass-centered Chicago label, and thanks--here's what folkies are for.

FALSE,B+,Peter and the Test Tube Babies,Peter and the Test Tube Babies,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5608,"
In this time of micromargins and cults subdividing like paramecia, we gravitate toward bands that hark to whatever obscure titans we picked up on when obscurism was a harmless sideline. For me it was the Vibrators, the wildest and tightest of Britain's trad rockers in punk disguise, and I bet these guys were there. Despite the chiming expansiveness of the hooks and song lengths, they're the same nasty group, driven to drink by their microcultish prospects.
"
FALSE,B+,The Shit Factory,Peter and the Test Tube Babies,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6132,"
Maybe this delicious joke is wasted on the U.S.A., where we endure the middle-class schlock of Diane Warren rather than the lowbrow banality of the Stock/Aitken/Waterman these latter-day Britpunks vomit back so relentlessly. But the Rick Astley cover will connect--great chords never die, roit? And as an added attraction, ""Venus"" becomes ""Penis."" I think.
"
FALSE,B+,Release,Pet Shop Boys,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11211,"
Eventually, the tunes fall into place. What never materialize in sufficient number are the billowing climaxes and cutting remarks that mark their best albums, meaning most of them. Continuing their tragically heartening journey into normality, they provide several highly serviceable straight love songs, and I hope someone explains to me whether ""Birthday Boy"" is really Jesus or somebody just thinks so. And then there's the Eminem track. The Eminem track is . . . wondrous, transcendent, a blow against rap homophobia, a great work of art. If buying this album is the only way you can hear it, don't hesitate. Form a pool if you have to.
"
FALSE,B+,Full Moon Fever,Tom Petty,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3973,"
He wanted something off-the-cuff and got lucky: except for the punk putdown and the pseudo-Dylan throwaway, both nice on their own terms, nary a lyric nor tune clashes with the terrific early-Byrds cover. If guys made roots-rock albums anymore, anything here would spruce one up.
"
FALSE,B+,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3971,"
Addicts of updated nostalgia and rock and roll readymades should find this a sly and authentic commentary on the evolving dilemma of Harold Teen. The songs are cute, the riffs executed with more dynamism than usual, and the singing attractively phlegmy. And like they say at the end of other cartoons, that's all, folks.
"
FALSE,B+,Damn the Torpedoes,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3972,"
This is a breakthrough for Petty because for the first time the Heartbreakers (his Heartbreakers, this L.A.M.F. fan should specify) are rocking as powerfully as he's writing. But whether Petty has any need to rock out beyond the sheer doing of it--whether he has anything to say--remains shrouded in banality. Thus he establishes himself as the perfect rock and roller for those who want good--very good, because Petty really knows his stuff--rock and roll that can be forgotten as soon as the record or the concert is over, rock and roll that won't disturb your sleep, your conscience, or your precious bodily rhythms.
"
FALSE,B+,Let Me Up (I've Had Enough),Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5612,"
For such a downhome guy, Petty has a major instinct for the news hook. Here, after defying premium pricing, reconstructing the South, and touring with somebody famous, he exploits the Dylan connection once again. In the tradition of his new hero, Petty's plan was no plan--he and the guys just went into the studio and these songs came out. And whaddaya know? Stick the thing in your playback mechanism of choice and these songs come out--for the first time in his career, the man sounds like  the natural he's worked so hard at being.
"
FALSE,B+,Yuppie Drone,The Pheromones,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5660,"
Two folkie ""brothers"" with cheap electronic instruments as well as acoustic guitars. Also with half-decent day jobs, I bet--they know the texture of selling out. Their jabs at the international monetary system and the world leader they dub the Great Rondini are simple and telling, and there can never be too many of them.

FALSE,B+,Burnin',Esther Phillips,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5661,"
With her lubricious, naturally sardonic high vibrato, this modern blues singer is well equipped to carry Dinah Washington's torch, and a club date with the likes of Chuck Rainey and Cornell Dupree is the perfect place for her to shine her light--even the horn overdubs sound hot. But there are only three blues, and she doesn't bring quite enough to either the standards (""Shangri-La"" is the most regrettable) or the ""contemporary material"" (one Aretha, one Beatles) with which a nightclub pro fills out her act.
"
FALSE,B+,Performance,Esther Phillips,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5664,"
Phillips's adventurous material is one reason her jazzy pop blues are so lively, but here she's bested by Eugene McDaniels's ""Disposable Society"" (""They've thrown away sincerity, the keystone of integrity"") and Allen Toussaint's title tune (""I'm a thing that makes music they don't understand""). On the other hand, eight minutes of Chris Smithers's ""I Feel the Same"" seems just about right.
"
FALSE,B+,"You've Come a Long Way, Baby",Esther Phillips,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5668,"
Anyone who believes Creed Taylor is a neutral presence should check out Phillips on her own: using Kudu producer Pee Wee Ellis and the basic Kudu formula--mixing blues and standards and rock with MOR and disco crossovers--she comes up with her most consistent album of the '70s. She divvies up the sides, putting mostly crossover stuff on the B, where it holds its own. She takes on someone named Mischa Siegal to help Ellis with the string arrangements, which are discreet, more trim than wallpaper. And she does an extra blues. Not to mention ""Into the Mystic.""
"
FALSE,B+,Here's Esther . . . Are You Ready,Esther Phillips,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5670,"
Proving her resilience once again, this thirty-year-woman skates over ""Philadelphia Freedom"" with a lot more cool than Aretha managed on ""The Weight,"" explores her blues roots with a Ruby &amp; the Romantics cover, and gets good material out of what still looks suspiciously like a stable. Special plaudits to producer Harvey Mason, who reminds us that disco horns and strings are supposed to push push. Fave: the danceable get-down parody, ""Oo Oop Oo Oop.""
"
FALSE,B+,Good Black Is Hard to Crack,Esther Phillips,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8244,"
No longer the blueswoman slipping into a more fashionable rhythm, Phillips has made that light, guitar-accented dance beat her own, and here she pursues it without compromises--no violins or fancy horns, just the groove. Only occasionally is the material more than adequate, but to hear her twist a song's natural shape against the smooth pulse and background harmonies is to wonder which is going to crack first.
"
FALSE,B+,John Phillips,John Phillips,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5671,"
Phillips doesn't have a beautiful voice--that was Denny Doherty--but he can project as well as write, and most of these murmured reports from Topanga and Malibu are tossed off with a not unattractive noblesse oblige. Lou Adler's unhurried, witty, soul- and country-tinged production suits them perfectly. Elitist, perhaps, but more about leisure enjoyed in the wake of accomplishment than about the perquisites of money and power.

Kinda restores your faith in humanity for these guys to make like they know the difference between intelligent and pretentious. Page McConnell plays blues, Trey Anastasio plays Jerry, and David Byrne, ZZ Top, and the 19th-century team of Joe Howard and Ida Emerson beef up the fey songwriting. Plus you have to love their long overdue Doors interpolation: ""Mother . . . I want to cook you breakfast.""

Maybe I'm getting sated--how many jazz-classical-tango suites does a Yank rock and roller need? Still, as someone who never had much use for Red Headed Stranger, I note that the historical metaphor this time is the guapo--a ""hero or hoodlum,"" hold the hero. Also, the ruminative interludes suggest that Piazzolla's gift is for passion rather than romanticism.

FALSE,B+,In Philadelphia,Wilson Pickett,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4191,"
What the Gamble-Huff band does for Pickett, Pickett does for the Gamble-Huff songwriters. The way the horns mix Southern drawl and Northern speed-rap makes me nervous, and I wish side two slowed down with the oblique ""Help the Needy"" instead of the all-over-the-place ""Days Go By,"" but overall the musicians make the singer go and the singer makes the songs go.

FALSE,B+,100 Proof,Kellie Pickler,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15927,"
American Idol haunts this artistic breakthrough, a sense that she'll always sing what she's told no matter how many composition credits she bags--six out of 11 here, including only one of the three tough-talking openers without which I'd never have gotten to where ""Long As I Never See You Again"" started showing its muscle. But if making nice comes all too naturally, the ones about the daughter she doesn't have and the father she was stuck with say that love is something she's willing to tough out.

Six unhurried songs from a Vermont band given to satire (and music) whose hale, unsmartalecky tone could never happen in the city.

Armed with a Day-Glo dye job and some ace Babyface subcontracts, a tough talker diddles teenpop's love button. In a world where the half-word ""sh-"" teeters on the edge of going too far, she and hers bet-correctly-that a simple ""I'm pissed"" will pack a wallop, and work from there.

This has its share of obvious moments. But I can only assume that those who accuse this band of repetitious cynicism are stuck in such a cynical rut themselves that a piece of well-constructed political program music--how did we used to say it?--puts them uptight.

With the rerecorded ""Money"" sporting a livelier bottom to protect them from truth-in-titling and felonious injury charges, this gathers up their tuneful moments, which have always been far between--so far between, in fact, that even the unconverted may miss the ersatz symphonic structures in which they're properly embedded.

There's nothing especially forbidding or avant about these six Minneapolis boys, but chances are they'll never get to Milwaukee and not for lack of talent, though they could use a singer. It's just that they're obviously in it for the art. This is generic rock and roll for the sheer formal pleasure of it--now pop, now punk, now Stones, now nice, now nasty, usually nasty.

They're in love and they don't know why--with rock and roll, which is heartening in a time when so many college dropouts have lost touch with the verities. You can tell from the bruising riffs, the rousing choruses, the cute little bass melodies, the solid if changeable beat. But not from any words they sing. They'll improve in direct relation to their improved contact with the outside world. Getting famous too fast could ruin them.

The fairyland psychedelica and many-hued outfits on the cover led me to dismiss the music as camp satire or idiot nostalgia. But ""Euphoric Trapdoor Shoes"" and ""Rattail Comb"" work for their laughs, and other songs achieve an even greater complexity of tone. The group's Anglophile diction can be prissy or sarcastic or acid-wild; their music is gimmicky and even silly sometimes, but like ""She's a Rainbow"" or ""Itchycoo Park"" it's also melodic and pleasurable and strong. Almost alone among the neopsychedelics, they actually have something to say about the '60s: they understand that to write lines like ""Loneliness is a sad companion/Loveliness is all she feels"" may well mean you're foolish but doesn't necessarily make you a fool.

In its heretical return to a time-honored people's form, its appropriation of available spiritual values as an antidote to materialist oppression, and its embrace of the Christ who ""blasphemed against the order of the world,"" this smuggled religious message from the long-suffering Czech anarchists makes perfect sense. Out of context, however, it's a little hard to take--happy though I am to have a trot, I don't find myself personally enriched when I read along with the Biblical texts and stories. And despite the obsessive bass lines and ostinatos, the only ""rock"" it brings to mind is Henry Cow, which on a strictly compositional level seems purer to me. But that's not to say that this whatever-it-is music, masterminded by free saxophonist Vratislav Brabanec, isn't satisfying on its own terms--or to mention that side two, especially the long, painful ""Father, Father,"" makes my stomach churn every time I concentrate.

Having been left tepid by Irish music from the Chieftains to Clannad, I filed this after a token try. Drumbeats or no drumbeats, I figured it was just beyond me. And some of it is--reels that aren't rockin', accents further garbled in the speedfolk rush.

Imagine the Mighty Lemon Drops with extra percussion singing about breakfast, sex, and wonder in a place where central heating just isn't an issue. Honolulu, Austin, what's the dif? They're Sun Belt hippies either way, glad to be alive where the living is easy.

Entranced by the commercial potential of this novelty act, I forgot how novelty acts translate to plastic. The Upfront Horns overstep themselves by half, the inflections are too Jolson for their own good, and even if the television audience is never the wiser, the material is pretty obvious. I want more ""Screwy Music"" and ""Hot Hot Hot,"" less ""Smack Dab in the Middle"" and ""Good Morning, Judge."" And while it's kinda hip to pick up on songs that Al and Aretha were covering back when you favored fishnet hose, it's also foolhardy, especially when you're hard pressed to beat Eric Burdon at ""House of the Rising Sun.""

Thanks to (coproducer) Berry Gordy and the miracle of modern multitracking, Bonnie makes like the Marvelettes of your dreams for an entire side. People didn't conceive vocals this intricate and funky back in Motown's prime, much less overdub them single-larynxed, and the result is remakes that outdo the originals--by Brenda Holloway and the Elgins--and originals that stand alongside. The other side comprises originals of more diminutive stature cowritten by (coproducer) Jeffrey Bowen. (Catalogue number: M7-911R1).

FALSE,B+,The Best of the Pointer Sisters,The Pointer Sisters,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5699,"
I realize in retrospect that I didn't like how they sounded mostly because I didn't like what they portended--camp-elegant escapist nostalgia--less liberating than Bette or Dr. Buzzard, but less reactionary than Manhattan Transfer or whoever's breaking out of the boites this month. Church roots help, and not just vocally--their superb taste (from Dizzy Gillespie to Allen Toussaint) has a moral center expressed in songs of their own like ""Jada,"" a generation-gap lyric that ranks with ""Handbags and Gladrags,"" and ""Shakey Flat,"" about moving to the country from an actual city. What's more, someone seems to know when they're good--with David Rubinson putting his twenty grand in, they've committed a lot of excesses and banalities, but not too many survive on this compilation.

It's supposed to be tragic that these long-running pros have walked away from America's rich musical heritage in pursuit of the pop buck, but as someone who's always had his doubts about their historical depth, I think the electrodance they settle on here suits them fine. Certainly Richard Perry has assigned songs that throw the new style in your face--titles like ""Automatic"" and ""Neutron Dance"" and ""Dance Electric"" may offend those who wish they still dressed like the Savoy.

Hard rock trash as radio readymades, these cheerful young phonies earn their Gene Simmons cover art. A residue of metal principle spoiled the top 40 on their debut, but here they sell out like they know this stuff is only good when it's really shitty.

It's pointless to deny that they make the chops work for the common good--both their trickiness and their simplicity provide consistent pleasure here. But with drummer, manager, and booking agent all scions of a CIA honcho, I have my doubts about their standing as a progressive force. Whether you're following in the old man's footsteps, offing the motherfucker, or striving for a livable compromise, roots like that leave you twisted, if only to the tune of a middlebrow clich�����""There is no political solution."" In the kindest construction, say their politics are as astute, liberal, and well-meaning as those of Pete ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" Townshend, who also needs reminding that we're not just spirits in the material world--we're also matter in the material world, which is why things get sticky.

I prefer my musical watersheds juicier than this latest installment in their snazzy pop saga, and my rock middlebrows zanier, or at least nicer. If only the single of the summer was a little more ambiguous, so we could hear it as a poem of mistrust to the Pope or the Secretary of State; instead, Sting wears his sexual resentment on his chord changes like a closet ""American Woman"" fan, reserving the ambiguity for his Jungian conundrums, which I'm sure deserve no better.

Amid the sludge of Yew Ess Ay 1977, the chiming, slightly tinny British Invasion tributes of these pioneering L.A. power poppers were as daring formally as their self-distributed album was politically. Two years later everybody's doing it and their synthesis has become correspondingly fuller and more intricate, incorporating Anglophile moves that range from Roxy Music automation to Clashy football-cheer backup vocals. Still missing are depth of vision (these are power poppers, after all) and killer hooks (aren't they?).

This album provides what it advertises only to those who consider Iggy a font of natural wisdom--there are such people, you know.

Play this a few times and in two years you'll still recall five songs when you put it on again: ""Dog Food,"" ""I Snub You,"" ""Loco Mosquito,"" ""I'm a Conservative,"" ""Play it Safe.""

Peulhs have their own culture, which neighboring peoples feel in sharper detail than I can. So for me Poulo's eight songs in 35 minutes captivate as West African with a twist, softening those circular grooves with singing more dulcet than, say, genteel Rokia Traor������������������'s, never mind alarm-bell Noura Mint Seymali's. Although the grooves ride the Peulh variant of the strummed and plucked ngoni lute, they come into their own when a one-stringed violin the Peulhs call a soku echoes the vocal line. The press release indicates that Poulo's lyrics praise traders, blacksmiths, a marabout, and of course her patrons. But what tourists like us grok is"

Paddy McAloon is a type we've met many times before--the well-meaning cad. Expressing himself with a grace befitting an intimate of Faron Young and ""Georgie"" Gershwin, he's sweet enough to come out on the losing side sometimes, but in the end he'll probably ""let that lovely creature down,"" because he can't resist a piece of ass. J.D. Considine calls this music ""Steely Dan Lite,"" which suggests the crucial contribution of producer-sideman Thomas Dolby but misses its pop-folk roots. Reminds me more of the justly obscure, unjustly forgotten Jo Mama--or of Aztec Camera if Roddy Frame were a cad.

As an evangelical tool, white gospel balances the sweet and the sententious the way ""Reach Out to Jesus"" does, but too often it topples like ""An Evening Prayer,"" and guess in which direction. Still, Elvis doesn't toss this stuff off--he hasn't sung with such consistent care since his comeback was at stake. And just like black gospel (fancy that), ""sacred"" music isn't always solemn--half the time it's fast enough to pass for rock and roll. In fact, for a counterpart to the airy intensity and passionate grace of ""I, John"" you might have to go back to the Sun recordings.

The idea is to remove the goop--strings, horns, choruses--from nondescript '70s album tracks, shuffle 'em up good, and call it ""pure Elvis."" But though Volume 1 was a bare-faced exploitation, this one happens to work. Maybe someone figured the potential market hated goop of any kind. In any case, the song selection is neat, including ""Green Green Grass of Home,"" ""Thinking About You,"" the lovely ""I Can Help,"" and a previously unreleased ""studio jam session"" on Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice"" that is actually too long at 8:36. The mix is weird--I hear imperfectly erased goop ghosts on ""Way Down,"" for instance--but as near as I can tell this is EP's best pop album of the decade.

In which the pre-RCA tyro finds a groove while making nice for squealing young country fans. What's amazing about the groove is that it's drumless, loose if not at all improvised, far more like blues and/or folk music than even his earliest studio work. What's amazing about the nice is how lascivious it is--when he invites his gal to ""do what we done before"" in ""Baby Let's Play House,"" you can just about see her legs sticking over the back of the couch.

The medium-priced four-to-six-track twelve-inch is introductory product suited to young bands who are getting their songwriting shit together (or have already shot their songwriting wad). For this young band, however, it's interim product--two singles that went nowhere on the charts, one B side that goes nowhere period, one B side that goes to Cuba with Bo Diddley, and a live version of a single that already went somewhere (though live it goes even further). All of it you've heard before, and some of it you'll hear again, when they get their follow-up album shit together.

Anyway, it's always the words I remember, not the melodies. I mean, I never thought they were such hookmeisters to begin with, but at times this relies so much on texture and flow it sounds like a punk Hissing of Summer Lawns.

Price was the biggest, roughest shouter in New Orleans r&amp;b, and gumbo aficionados will tell you it was a tragedy when those bad Northerners stole him away. Price didn't agree, and I know what he means. Even honed down to 14 tracks in 36 minutes over Dave Bartholomew's ace band, his Specialty material is so unthinkingly generic that few of the songs distinguish themselves even as novelties. In addition to Price's signature ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy,"" which I like no less and also no more in this lowdown version than as the sub-two-minute rocker ABC-Paramount made of it, my best candidate would be the accurately entitled ""Oo-Ee Baby,"" which no one has ever heard of because it ain't all that novel. Nevertheless, this is pretty entertaining for a historical document, and it's augmented by the label's generic 26-minute bonus disc, which you'll probably play more: 10 r&amp;b classics that include Roy Milton's ""R.M.

For anyone who calls herself country to blame women's troubles on ""rich white men"" is a miraculous thing, as is a title closer that remembers when ""Reagan was selling weapons to the leaders of Iran."" But singing a lyric isn't the same as driving it home, and she should never have removed the echo from a soft-edged soprano that needs all the vulgarity it can enact. I admire the one she has the brass to call ""Pay Gap."" But I respond more naturally to the losing-the-farm saga ""Heart of America,"" which blames ""the big banks"" like it should, and the self-determined ""Loner,"" which warns ""You get what you pay for, sometimes you pay twice."" So let's just call her a folkie, shall we? That way we can be sure we're getting what we paid for.

As someone who saw the title film stoned in 1971, and loved it, I agree that this is one of the few putatively psychedelic albums ever to evoke the distractible ecstasy of actual psychedelic experience, flitting from detail to fascinating, ultimately meaningless detail. Crucially, the moods and referents that flash past are anchored by tunes and sounds so simple a zonked zombie can relate to them. But as someone not altogether dismissive of the cofeature, Panic in Needle Park (Charles Theater on Avenue B, you could look it up), I must also note that, pace the highly apposite Stones rip that takes the trip back to earth, ""medication"" has never killed a hole that didn't come back gaping the next morning--a corny truth that renders this an achievement best admired from a sane distance.

He's a talented little guy, and this has plenty of pizzazz. But I'll take The Black Album's fat-bottomed whomp over its attention-grabbing beats and halfway decent tunes any day, and despite appearances it sure ain't where he explains why sexiness is next to godliness--lyrically it's sloppy if not pseudo if not stupid. This is doubly bothersome because added religious content is what it's supposed to have over its not terribly shocking alternative. Leading one to the obvious conclusion that the real reason the little guy made the switch was that he was scared to reveal how, shall we say, unpop he could be.

On his third studio double in a decade, he's definitely cheating. Half the music isn't really his, and the other half is overly subtle if not rehashed or just weak: title track, generational anthem, and lead single all reprise familiar themes, and the ballads fall short of the exquisite vocalese that can make his slow ones sing. But some of the subtle stuff--""Tick, Tick Bang""'s PE-style electrobeats, say--is pretty out, most of the received stuff is pretty surefire, and from unknowns to old pros, his cameos earn their billings. Also, there's half a great Time album here--did he steal it or just conceive it?

Take as a given that this is an overpriced exploitation or indulgence, depending on your point of view--that is, whether you're Prince or not. The two discs of A sides are indeed choice, but most come from albums that yield more choice (not to say choicer) stuff, and their recontextualization isn't as jaw-dropping as an admirer of our greatest popular musician might hope. Whether the duplications merit the tariff you can decide for yourself. So would the B sides justify purchase on their own were the little man so generous as to make them available as such (or were the world to end, whichever comes first)? And the answer is: maybe. The porny stuff--especially ""Irresistible Bitch,"" ""Scarlet Pussy,"" the wicked ""Feel U Up,"" and the absolutely classic ""Erotic City""--is must-hear for any sex fan. The funky stuff is fonky. The dog bit is like bow-wow. And the ballads are of every description, including godawful.

What I loved most about 1992 Deluxe was its spunk. Biting off and shaping up her girly voice into a lively signature flow, a runway rapper with pan-Manhattan attitude put ""my little titties and my fat belly"" in hip-hop's face and claimed street for an Afro-diasporic bohemia of her own devising. So of course I was disappointed when she went sad-sack emo on a mixtape timed to vie with Cardi. But soon I caught it catching my ear the way sad-sack anything seldom does. ""Goth as fuck,"" as she once bragged, she's not always so confident, and she wants us to know it. Her auto-tunelets range sad to determined, hopeful to boastful, hostile to empathetic. Depressive as fuck but nothing like self-indulgent, she tries to be not just honest but nice about it.

In the title tune, Prine reports that he's transcended his anger, and I'm happy for him, but a little worried about his music. Common Sense was agitated to the point of psychosis, but it had an obsessive logic nevertheless. Here Prine sounds like he's singing us bedtime stories, and while the gently humorous mood is attractive, at times it makes this ""crooked piece of time that we live in"" seem as harmless and corny as producer Steve Goodman's background moves; no accident that the closer, ""The Hobo Song,"" is Prine's most mawkish lyric to date. Still, Edward Lear's got nothing on this boy for meaningful nonsense, and just to prove he's still got the stuff he collaborates with Phil Spector on a surefile standard: ""If You Don't Want My Love,"" with lyrics worthy of its title.

Prine's reappearance on his own label suggests that the reasons for his absence were more corporate than personal. The songs suggest that he's not reading True Love on the back cover for solace or satire. Only ""The Bottomless Lake,"" copyrighted in 1977, falls into his wild-ass whimsy mode, and only the musically retiring ""Maureen, Maureen"" gets any more acerbic than that.

Just in case you were wondering, this relaxed, confident album is where Prine comes out and admits he's a folkie, opening with an A.P. Carter tune he's been performing for a quarter century and commandeering sidemen from New Grass Revival and suchlike. The songs are straightforward and homemade, their great theme the varied love life of a man whose wife Rachel plays bass and sings harmony here and there, though not on the extended beer commercial ""Out of Love,"" nor on ""Bad Boy,"" about ""how to be guilty without being Catholic.""

Not bad for profit taking. The melodies are at their ingratiating schlock-classical best, the tempos up enough to render the lyrics extraneous. Among the four never-on-LP inducements are ""Lime Street Blues,"" a jolly barrelhouse that mentions underpants, and ""Homburg,"" which introduces their ""multilingual business friend."" But the old stuff reminds us that Keith Reid once knew writing can be a goof--even his ""commercial"" lyrics from the '70s (""Simple Sister,"" ""Whiskey Train"") are self-servingly arrogant. And the Gary-Brooker's-greatest format demonstrates conclusively that he learned his oft-praised blues mannerisms from the constipated guy in the next toilet stall.

The hardcore debut of 1983 doesn't sound very hardcore, which may not bode well for the movement--this is like a more rigorous, less cosmic PIL. There's a touch too much Geddy Lee in Richard Brown's vocals, but he sure doesn't think like Geddy Lee--avoiding tantrum and who-am-I?, these spare slogans are underpinned by actual left theory, though not much practice.

Their 2009 debut LP is palpably younger--slightly quicker and considerably more high-flown, the vocals longer on forced scansion and childish drawl. The tune prospecting is almost as astute, however, and topped off lyrically by the 20-is-forever fight song ""Tennessee"" (""Baby let's push our limits"") and the tell-me-your-feelings critique ""Like Who You Are"" (""We always discontinue what we don't misconstrue"").

Tired of the sardonic fake Pistolese, Richard Butler turns his heartfelt dispassion to an approach that bears the same relation to Bowieism as the earlier Furs did to punk. His seducerama is in the manner of an aging matinee idol who isn't quite as famous as he thinks he is; he sings as if he's known you for years even though you're both perfectly aware that so far your relationship goes no further than his offer of a lift back to your place. And if you're feeling detached enough yourself, you just may take him up on it.

It may seem redundant to accuse a rapper of arrogance, like accusing a politician of seeking power, but Chuck D takes the bully-boy orotundity of his school of rap elocution into a realm of vocal self-involvement worthy of Pavarotti, Steve Perry, or the preacher at a Richard Pryor funeral. And while I know the idea is to play him off the wheedling motor-mouth of his boy Flavor-Flav, why should I like the great man's fan any more than I like the great man? They've got literary chops--amid puns more Elvis Costello than Peter Tosh, their ""Megablast"" is cutting anticrack narrative-propaganda--and they make something personal of rap's ranking minimalist groove. But there's no fun in these guys, which given the intrinsic austerity of the groove means not much generosity either.

This is going along fine, politicizing indefatigably with cameo help from super-scratcher Davy DMX, saxophone pro Gerald Albright, Otis-channeling soul sister Sheila Brody, and Ziggy Marley 10,000 dutchies on, when finally, midway through, here comes some madman with the deeply stoopid ""31 Flavors"" and you realize it wasn't going along fine enough. Flav even contributes a superior Otis homage, about cars, and sells the irresistible ""Broke Diva,"" in which Chuck joins an attack on gold-diggers I have the feeling Mrs. Chuck could do without. To compensate, the boss ropes the celebreality money-grubber into an attack on ""Fame.""

FALSE,B+,Album,Public Image Ltd.,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2836,"
John Lydon's name on the sticker, combined with his sudden eagerness to shoot the shit with representatives of the press, has everybody confused. This isn't a Lydon record that (the conveniently uncredited) Bill Laswell happened to produce, it's a Laswell record custom-designed for Lydon, with whom the auteur shares a disappointed revolutionary's professional interest in power. Just abstract the production style Laswell's adapted to artists as diverse as Mick Jagger and Herbie Hancock, think Sex Pistols, and you'll get something like this, as clinical as brain surgery and as impersonal as a battering ram, with unlikely virtuosos playing the Cook and Jones parts. It kicks in because they're both cold bastards; it feels out of whack anyway because Lydon can't match Laswell's commitment and still has too much integrity to fake it (and maybe also because he has never been in the same room with most of the musicians in this ""band"").

They seem like nice boys and they certainly have nice voices, but whole glee clubs of cousins from Florida could claim the same. The enduring value of their pop soul is a bizzers' triumph--from Muscle Shoals backing, to Don Penn and Steve Cropper filler, to this vinyl document, selected and annotated by Mitchell Cohen to finesse whole paragraphs of invidious comparison.

Vanessa Ellison's bellowed admonitions, Randy Bewley's guitar gradients, Michael Lachowski's peripatetic bass, and Curtis Crowe's prodigious roundhouse drumming add up to an unmistakable sound. I'm impressed. But I wish they'd come up with a few more riffs/melodies as deliberate and haunting as those of ""Volume"" and ""Stop It"" and the foolishly omitted ""Cool."" And while I admire their bare-boned lyrical concept, often the unpretentiousness seems mannered, like some comp-lit cross between Robbe-Grillet and Ted Berrigan.

Thirty-three years after the fact, a double-vinyl live album completes the catalogue of Vanessa Briscoe's DOR skyrockets from Athens G-A. Because it documents their very last show, recorded before an enraptured local audience on December 1, 1983, I had major hopes. But since like all live recordings it's subject to audio, pace, and pheromone deficits, I'm obliged to report that it only takes off second half--there are rumblings throughout, sure, but I hear ""Feast on My Heart"" as the turning point and side four as the must-play. My favorite is the one song I didn't know and also the finale: ""Party Zone."" I also appreciate the zooming encore: the Batman theme.

A success story whose taste in beats has always run pop, she vowed to ""burn MC's like calories"" and was off the charts in a month for her trouble. Oh well--if Chuck D can't get respect with Spike Lee behind him, what can a fat-flaunting, sitcom-fronting, dyke-playing woman expect? Here's hoping she swings every way she wants and recommending her sexual ambivalence to females everywhere. Things get bland and icky, especially when designated ingenue Inaya Jafan makes nice to the fellas, but the thematic ""Yes/No"" is educational right down to its tender skit. And for what it's worth, by the end of the record she seems to be proposing to the guy it's aimed at. Really, 28 isn't too old--and Latifah knows it.

The solid heads and well-schooled solos of John Gilmore, Marshall Allen, and the former Herman Blount are avant-trad at its most accessible, but note that the melodic panjazz swing showcased here is far more human-sounding and heartbeat-anchored than the children of Star Wars and videogames expect of ""easy listening for intergalactic travel."" Orbital fans out to slake their craving for strange should make room in their budget for one of the DIY albums where these 18 nonhits began.

Moorish and/or North African Spain is the idea, beginning with a flamenco colombiana--a folkloric variant that arose in the '30s claiming cross-Atlantic roots, only the hook goes to a Renaissance oboe called a cromornos, one of many medieval instruments on display. Which means that in a time when sensitivity to the Euro-Arab nexus is the way of both justice and survival, what's most original about this band is its translation of medieval into modern--which does constitute a sonic reminder that European culture isn't as pure as Silvio Berlusconi believes. What's most entertaining about it, meanwhile, is its new embrace of the supple and the songful. What's most annoying about it is its fusion and art-rock retentions.

Makan Ganessy will lose you everywhere but the entranced ""Mady Guindo""; Salif Keita will make life worth living on ""Maki"" even if ""Soyomba"" then disappoints.

Marcellus Hall represents Manhattan art-slackerdom like the proud denizen he is.

In their dubious pro-am musicianship and unavoidably spacy ambience, both of Rough Trade's very modern girl groups recall late-'60s art-rock of the Cantabrigian school--Kevin Ayers, Soft Machine, that ilk. But where Essential Logic also recalls art-rock of the Juilliard school, the Raincoats' punk-goes-folk-rock feels friendly even in its arty hostility. If the tentativeness of the rhythms and vocals is accentuated by the medium tempos they prefer, the unevenness of their songwriting means some of it is very good. Sure the multiple genderfuck ""Lola"" is what sucks you in, but you may end up preferring the other side. As with Lora Logic's sax, the signature and hook is Vicky Aspinall's violin, which she saws rather than plays.

I hate to be schematic, but they ask for it: for the first 10 tracks, the songs alternate in lockstep, Ana Da Silva-Gina Birch and forgettable-remarkable. What puts this comeback over the top is that the last two go Birch-Da Silva remarkable-remarkable--the literal ""Love a Loser,"" which should be a single if only because the infertility fantasy and the old-age fantasy and even the pretty fantasy are a little too remarkable for MTV, and Da Silva's title tune, which summons empathy for a jilted stalker who ends up getting hold of his fantasies. And as always, only at a higher level of instrumental expertise, the band's musical charms are coextensive with its limitations.

Factory alternative neither the jug-band-with-piano ""Hustlin' Blues,"" where she turns her pimp over to the law, nor the loose-limbed New Orleans ""Sissy Blues,"" where her man samples transvestite jellyroll. But they do include the title song, a historically accurate alternative to the identically named August Wilson play without which the album would not exist, ""Sleep Talking Blues,"" in which revenge doesn't cheer her up much, and ""Shave 'Em Dry Blues,"" in which adultery is quick, hard, and good for what ails her.

All but the schlockiest variants of what must still be called mainstream rock are listing toward marginality so fast that soon the whole genre will be a purist specialty like white blues. Overlooking a few organ arpeggios and obvious guitar solos, these four Adrian Belew-produced Ohioans do their passion proud, with Rob Fetters's funny but not parodic (or slavish) Springsteen impression on ""Miserable World"" a typical high point. The songs stick, too, though the lyrics are matter-of-fact enough about bent sex to make me wonder what the really kinky people in Cincinnati are like. Then again, in Cincinnati a purist mainstream rock band may well define kinky.

I suppose I should blame Peter Asher for how flat a few of these songs sound, but in fact I blame him only for pianist Don Grolnick, who single-handedly (well, actually I guess he used two) transforms the title cut from a cry of alcoholic despair to a self-pitying piece of hightone lounge schlock. She's never sounded better on the slow ones--Hayes-Porter's ""Your Good Thing"" is the killer--and her own ""Standing by the Same Old Love"" adds significantly to the pitiful store of rock songs about enduring sexual relationships. But I could stand some more hard raunch.

The nicest Ramone, who was revealing his secret identity well before he knew he had cancer, stands tall as a gentle goof, sounding contemplative partly because he's slowed down a little, partly because music has speeded up a little, and partly because he is. Spareness bleeds into vagueness, minimalism into unfinished business, which may be how he would have wanted these songs but isn't necessarily how we want them. Nevertheless, his ashram seeker is the perfect counterweight to his financial analyst, ""What a Wonderful World"" to ""1969."" And when he writes from his bed of pain it really hurts.
"
FALSE,B+,End of the Century,Ramones,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3798,"
Sad. The best cut is ""I'm Affected"" (note double-edged title); the second best is a Ronettes remake (Joey outsings Andy Kim); the third best is a ballad about their manager (now departed). They also remake two of their own songs--""Judy Is a Punk"" (good sequel) and ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" (unnecessary Spectorization)--and one of the Heartbreakers' (inferior). And take on the Sports and Joe Jackson with a song about the radio that would be the worst they'd ever written were it not for ""This Ain't Havana"" and ""High Risk Insurance,"" in which the group's reactionary political instincts finally escape that invisible ironic shield (bet Johnny provided worse-than-Barry-McGuire rhymes like ""on your way to life's promotion/You hinder it with emotion""). Phil Spector doesn't make that much difference; his guitar overdubs are worse than his orchestrations, and they're not uncute. But this band sounds tired.

Even if ""Animal Boy"" and ""Ape Man Hop"" were code for B-boy, which they're not, this wouldn't keep the promise of the remixed and retitled ""My Head Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg),"" because these days code is too fucking subtle. And what we get instead is jungle bunnies, two (pretty good) songs about Joey's drinking, another (not so good) one about his misery, Dee Dee one-for-three, the defensive-sounding ""She Belongs to Me,"" the defensive-sounding ""Crummy Stuff,"" and an anthem I believe called ""Something to Believe In.""

Sacred steel boogies, with better songs than are normally required or do I mean inspired at jamworld's secular camp meetings. Two Carlos Santana cameos add flash and a thickness, and when they cover ""Love Rollercoaster"" you'll swear they snuck Bootsy in the side door. Respect to Tedeschi-Trucks, absolutely.

Talk about acid casualties--these guys are victims of psychedelica even if they never touched the stuff. But those who ignore the atrocious title and listen to the songs are in for a surprise, because this is no Freedom Suite. In fact, it may be their most consistent regular-release LP--only one waste cut per side. If the Rascals are spouting universalist truisms, so is every other soul band these days--usually without coming up with anything as original or unpretentious as the warmly tongue-in-cheek ""Right On."" The only problem is that that's the high point--no new classics for Aretha to cover. Special surprise: Dino Danelli's modal jazz instrumental ""Name.""

As a somewhat skeptical admirer of Jim Podrasky's country-rock popcraft--how much can so static a commodity be worth in these careening times?--I was irritated at first by the big drum sound, tacked on to this pop product as it is to all others in these conformist times. Only when startled from a revery induced by a competing commodity did I realize that cowriter Terry Wilson's indubitable guitar-banjo-lapsteel-keybs-etc. demanded the percussive kinetics. The boy can't be stopped, his virtuosity serving a song-form rock and roll that's implosive rather than onrocking, pyrotechnic rather than jet-propelled. Even when Podrasky's romantic headaches and American tragedies aren't at a peak of observation, you listen. When they are, you learn.

Resistant though I am to the seductions of falsetto romanticism, the reincarnated Moments generate a Persuasions-like formal intensity with a few simple gimmicks--studio patter, apparently impromptu acappella codas, fast songs.

Ray Parker's idea is to synthesize the old black-music tradition of the male vocal group with the new one of the self-contained funk band, and here he proves that he has what it takes as a composer to keep the idea going.

Arranged chronologically in order of recording and release, these five two-sided singles, one three-song mini-EP, and one split seven-inch cohered better in their original formats--in sequence, the internally consistent comic-book gothic ""Trapped Here""/""Hiding Hole""/""DOA"" and sad-sack romance ""No Time""/""You Were Sleeping"" undercut rather than augment each other. It's not like Reatard is up to the level of classic Buzzcocks or something--his real but inconsistent pop gift can use a little shaping.

On record, he's an exemplary folkie, making up in organizational intelligence what he lacks in inventive spark. Melding antique songs of varying origin into a mature New Orleans instrumentation absent from his unaccompanied stage appearances--which are at first intriguing, then stultifying and/or annoying--he offers an alternative to the narrowness of both stylistic commitment and audio reproduction that makes the original New Orleans recordings inaccessible. Worthwhile work.

Beyond sacred schlock-by-association and rock and roll gifts, Christmas is a pop holiday that plays best in the background, which suits Redbone's forgettable old-timey lassitude. Who needs a major stylist interpreting ""White Christmas"" and ""Frosty the Snowman""? Both material and occasion call for a pleasantly anonymous medium, and if he sticks in a pleasantly distinctive obscurity like the hula-tinged title tune, don't look it in the chord changes.

Atlantic is obviously scraping bottom on Otis--there's nothing here I'd play to prove he was the greatest soul singer who ever lived, and several of the performances sound exploratory. But almost every track offers some special moment--the curly little horn part on ""Give Away None of My Love,"" Otis's offer to bet ""five dollars and a quarter or even more"" on ""Snatch a Little Piece,"" his tributes to fellow Maconites James Brown and Richard Penniman. And even when he's got-ta got-ta got-ta do his shtick he's one of a kind.

A glorified demo, so the sound could be crisper, but Tom Trombley compensates by sending out a flat, tough beat as pure if not as magical as Charlie Watts himself. And the material is there: ""Out of Step"" and (in a less theoretical vein) ""Black Plastic Shoes"" might qualify as theme songs for a band given to voicing the discontents of fairly ordinary nonmetropolitan under-twenty-fives who don't want to buy into the system if they can help it.

Less bracing than the nonstop Let's Go!, with only a few tunes--the miniature (""Fistfight at the Beach"") even more than the metaphor (""Cruise to Nowhere"") or the final statement (""Sound of Breaking Down"")--that bite hard enough to break the skin. But on ""Pub Rockin'"" they cop to their roots' roots, and you have to be amazed at how good punk was for these guys. They're devoid of Ameriphilia--of Dr. Feelgood's raunchy role-playing or Ducks Deluxe's mud-bottom romanticism. And if they don't write with the panache of Nick Lowe, they sure get to the point faster than Sean Tyla.

Title boast to the contrary, Reed has a commercial knack--he knows how to distinguish himself from competing bluesmen, more gifted ones included. His specialty is novelty lyrics like the title boast, here augmented by ""Fast Food Annie"" and ""Don't Drive Drunk."" Reparations from Stevie Ray Vaughan don't hurt either.

FALSE,B+,Take These Blues and Shove 'Em,A.C. Reed & His Spark Plugs,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8268,"
The crudest blues album anybody's made on purpose since Hound Dog Taylor died allows this saxophone player to sing--about needing a day job. Unlike his sometime leader Albert Collins, Reed doesn't stand a chance of knocking you over with his chops, which he knows. Unlike his noncousin Jimmy (whose tunes and harp parts he's wont to lift), he's far from certain to win you over with his slurs, either. This he may not know. But his earthiness is down-and-dirty enough to ensure that he'll come close.
"
FALSE,B+,Lou Reed,Lou Reed,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2139,"
Hard to know what to make of this. Certainly it's less committed--less rhythmically monolithic and staunchly weird--than the Velvets. Not that Reed is shying away from rock and roll or the demimonde. But when I'm feeling contrary he sounds not just ""decadent"" but jaded, fagged out. On the other hand, he dabbles with the best of them. ""Wild Child"" has the offhand, reportorial feel of a Bob Dylan dream, ""Walk It and Talk It"" is a ""2120 South Michigan Avenue"" based on ""Brown Sugar,"" and in ""I Can't Stand It"" lean post-gospel harmonies and a Stonesish bass line fill out that headlong mechanical ""Here She Comes Now"" rush. Question: what are the guys from Yes doing on this record? I mean, talk about staunchly weird. Or are we just talking about art-rock?
"
FALSE,B+,Sally Can't Dance,Lou Reed,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2142,"
Lou sure is adept at figuring out new ways to shit on people. I mean, what else are we to make of this grotesque hodgepodge of soul horns, flash guitar, deadpan songspeech, and indifferent rhymes? I don't know, and Lou probably doesn't either--even as he shits on us he can't staunch his own cleverness. So the hodgepodge produces juxtapositions that are funny and interesting, the title tune is as deadly accurate as it is mean-spirited, and ""Billy"" is simply moving, indifferent rhymes and all.
"
FALSE,B+,Coney Island Baby,Lou Reed,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2145,"
At first it's gratifying to ascertain that he's trying harder, but very soon that old cheapjack ennui begins to poke through. Oddly, though, most of the cheap stuff is near the surface--the songs sound warmer when you listen close. And not even in his most lyrical moments with the Velvets has he let his soft side show as nakedly as it does on the title cut.
"
FALSE,B+,Street Hassle,Lou Reed,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2147,"
I know Lou worked his ass off on this one, but he worked his ass off on Berlin, too--like so many of his contemporaries, maybe he's better off not aiming for masterpieces. The title sequence honors Eros as much as Thanatos, a heartening development, and I'm a belated convert to ""I Wanna Be Black,"" which treats racism as a stupid joke and gets away with it. But the production is muddled and the self-consciousness self-serving.
"
FALSE,B+,The Bells,Lou Reed,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2148,"
Lou is as sarcastic as ever--the lead cut is called ""Stupid Man,"" and in a typically acid rhyme he links ""capricious"" and ""death wish."" But due in part to the music's jazzy edge and warmly traditional rock and roll base (special thanks to Marty Fogel on saxophone) he also sounds . . . well-rounded, more than on Street Hassle. The jokes seem generous, the bitterness empathetic, the pain out front, the tenderness more than a fleeting mood. And the cuts that don't work--there are at least three or four--seem like thoughtful experiments, or simple failures, rather than throwaways. I haven't found him so likable since The Velvet Underground.
"
FALSE,B+,Live in Italy,Lou Reed,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8270,"
Unlike 1969 Velvet Underground Live, this isn't a song album, which is no surprise--a guitar album is what I was hoping for. But unlike Rock n Roll Animal it isn't a showoff showcase, either--it's a guitar ensemble album, which is subtler than I was hoping for. Reed and Robert Quine get their moments, but the matter at hand is the interaction of a crack rock and roll band. One of the things that makes Quine a great guitarist is his formal tact, and just as Fernando Saunders's bass defines Reed's recent music on record, the modulated anarchy of Quine's acerbic fills and background commentary defines the live stuff. Even so, I wish they'd arrived at a way for him to cut loose more within the structure, especially since Lou doesn't seem deeply interested in the well-worn classics that dominate the show. The function of crack rock and roll bands, after all, is to set songs.
"
FALSE,B+,City Lights,Lou Reed,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8271,"
His second Arista mix-and-match is said to unveil Lou the evolving romantic, though the voice is more compassionate than the songs it sings. The theme is ""Gimmie Some Good Times,"" much more at home here than on the aimless Rock and Roll Heart. Who ever said a romantic couldn't crack jokes whilst baring his heart--his lust and anger casual, his passion no more deeply felt than his cool? Reinforcing the impression: all the sides you need of Take No Prisoners--one.

FALSE,B+,The Raven,Lou Reed,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11883,"
Only a Lou-lou could love this concept album with a hole in the middle, by which I mean the theater piece that supposedly held all the new songs, old songs, new instrumentals, poetry readings, and cameo turns together. But though it's less than the sum of its parts, the parts are pretty arresting--Antony's castrato version of ""Perfect Day,"" for instance, is a terrible idea in theory that ends up beating the original. Gee, maybe Poe actually was the progenitor of Selby and Burroughs and, more importantly, Reed himself, who delivers the theme-setting ""Edgar Allan Poe"" with a rhythmic intensity that is, let's be frank, a rare thing in literary criticism. Best Performance in a Supporting Role: Steve Buscemi as a somewhat younger Lou Reed doing a lounge act the older Reed wrote.

I get shy when I write about putatively avant-garde composers like Reich--who am I to judge their compositional acuity? Somebody who knows great kitsch when he hears it, that's who. Music for 18 Musicians is damn near transcendent kitsch--what seems suspiciously lightweight at first reveals itself over countless hearings as durably ethereal. In contrast, these pieces sound dinky over the long haul--listenably dinky, but dinky. My favorite is ""Violin Phase,"" written for a solitary instrument back in 1967, before Reich got unpretentious.

Grown even more universal (and likable) in posttechno retrospect, Reich's mathematically ebbing-and-surging facsimile of eternal return is the great classic of minimalist trance, at once prettier and more austere than any Terry Riley or Philip Glass. Eleven minutes longer than in the ECM original ""owing to a tempo change governed by the breathing pattern of the clarinetist,"" this relaxed rerecording will appeal to graduates of the chillout room. But though rock and rollers can go with its flow, it's not a true reinterpretation like Bang on a Can's Eno, and I prefer the intensities I learned to love. Maybe Beethoven can be rehashed forever (and maybe not). With Reich, one is all any nonprofessional needs.

FALSE,B+,Rhythmatism,Steve Reid,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11323,"
Here's what happens when you oblige jazz artists to record themselves. The music is terrific; personally, I prefer this sampling from the forceful alto saxophonist Arthur Blythe to David Murray's work on Low Class Conspiracy, probably because it's simpler. Leader Reid, a drummer, always provides what the title promises, and like so many of the new players Blythe isn't limited to modern methods by his modernism--he favors fluent, straight-ahead Coltrane modalities, but also demonstrates why he belongs on a tune for Cannonball. But the sound is really lame--the drums are mixed up front without any gain in clarity or presence, and the horns could be coming through the bathroom door. A label like Blue Note, say, hasn't first-released any music this solid in years; I wonder how much just one album a year of it would cost.

FALSE,B+,Reckoning,R.E.M.,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2916,"
This charming band makes honestly reassuring music--those guitar chords ring out with a confidence in the underlying beauty of the world that's all but disappeared among rock-and-rollers who know what else is happening. As befits good Southerners, their sense of necessity resides in their drummer, which is why the Byrds analogies don't wash (who ever noticed Michael Clarke?) and why they shouldn't get carried away with the country moves (slow ones really are supposed to have words).
"
FALSE,B+,Fables of the Reconstruction,R.E.M.,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2917,"
If you had any doubts, new producer Joe Boyd clinches it: their formal frame of reference is folk-rock, nothing less, and nothing more. Because they're Southerners, they've always defeated folk-rock's crippling stasis: they have a good beat, and you can boogie to them. But as formalists they valorize the past by definition, and if their latest title means anything it's that they're slipping inexorably into the vague comforts of regret, mythos, and nostalgia. Trading energy for ever richer textures, their impressionism sacrifices its paradoxical edginess: it's doleful, slower, solidly grounded but harder to boogie to nevertheless.
"
FALSE,B+,Lifes Rich Pageant,R.E.M.,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2918,"
Musically, this talented minor band's fastest-breaking album represents no significant departure from the past, though just how many recapitulations of their lyricism one needs is clearly beginning to trouble those who took it too seriously in the first place. The players still make them and the singer-lyricist still refuses to define them, and while his projection has improved, it's hardly crystalline and wouldn't tell you anything you didn't know if it was. I mean, this is music for mushheads, and that it retains an undeniable if rather abstract charm only proves that there's a little mushhead in all of us. I give album four the nod over number three for its compelling snare sound and dynamic cover version. And insist that any normal person can make do with number one, when all this was a tad more spontaneous.

The ""air"" side combines the bite of their realest rock and roll with the shameless beauty their cult once lived for--it's funny and/or serious and/or rousing and/or elegiac right up to ""The Wrong Child,"" a title that speaks for itself and heralds the shit to follow. Which they dub the ""metal"" side, with heavy tempos and dubious poetry that make good on their intermittent moments only during the funny, serious, elegiac ""I Remember California.""

If the medieval dance tunes and Bach sarabandes on last year's Lady and the Unicorn were neither rock and roll nor my cup of tea, the same goes for these Child ballads and folkie blues. But anybody who can induce me to listen to something called ""Willy o' Winsbury"" all the way through is no ordinary folkie. I know because his mates in the Pentangle just tried it on Solomon's Seal. Which reminds me that Renbourn at his best is supple and modest--and bluesy--enough to remind me of the Pentangle at their best.

FALSE,B+,Street Called Desire,Ren���,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8277,"
Their youth and street aura are as much Peaches &amp; Herb as Womack &amp; Womack or Ashford &amp; simpson, but maturity is what they're after--the determined bliss and hot friction of a union beset like most unions by temptations, intrusions, distractions, and the need to eat. Though they sing better than they write, they also sing better than the competition, and as it happens this is the strongest set of songs in the tradition since W&amp;W's Love Wars--nothing classic or groundbreaking, but sometimes the truest hearts aren't legendary ones.

Thrashing their guitars or shambling like bumpkins or reading the personals w/musical accompaniment, this young band has a loose, freewheeling craziness that remains miraculously unaffected after three records. They'll try anything--there's even synthesizer percussion on one cut. If the rock and roll spirit is your bottom line, you'll love 'em. But because they play it so loose they do gravitate toward sloppy noise, which means that too often they're more conceptual than a loose, freewheeling rock and roll band ought to be.

FALSE,B+,Don't Tell a Soul,The Replacements,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3823,"
Circa Let It Be, Bob Stinson's guitar was a loud, unkempt match for Paul Westerberg's vocal, only he'd juice the notes with a little something extra and probably wrong, defining a band whose idea of inspiration was crashing into a snowbank and coming out with a six-pack. Especially on side two, the basic guitar move here is much classier: new guy Slim Dunlap plays hooks. On ""Back to Back"" Westerberg sings ""Back to back"" and Dunlap doubles a four-note cadence, on ""Achin' to Be"" Westerberg sings ""She's achin' . . ."" and Dunlap chimes in two-one two-three--like that. They aren't always so simplistic, but a decade-plus after the dawning of power pop the device reeks of the mechanical--except in country music, where formula is part of the charm, it's tough to bring off without sounding corny or manipulative. At its worst--I vote for ""Achin' to Be,"" which starts off ""She's kinda like an artist"" and never once slaps itself upside the head--Don't Tell a Soul is both. At its best--the Who homage ""I Won't"" (""I w-w-w-w-w-won't""), the Tommy Stinson anthem ""Anywhere's Better Than Here,"" or even ""I'll Be You,"" with Dunlap reaching bell-like through serious clamor--it sounds like old times.

""I Do My Swingin' at Home,"" Billy Sherrill has him say, but what makes Charlie special is that he also swings in the studio. That's one reason this doesn't sound like a formula country album. Another is that after ""Nice 'n' Easy"" he and his wife take over the songwriting on side one. Best: ""Memphis and Arkansas Bridge,"" about getting lost in the big city.

FALSE,B+,Talk Is Cheap,Keith Richards,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5944,"
State-of-the-art rock and roll traditionalism. Steve Jordan and Ivan Neville aren't just schooled in the verities, they're cocky enough to teach the verities new tricks, and the songs really do have a near-classic, half-remembered feel. It isn't just the late date that prevents them from going that extra mile, though--it's that Keith is singing, and Keith wrote the words. He's the soul of the Stones, fine. But as the Stones defined it, neotraditionalism takes concept, and no matter how fucked Mick is, concept would seem to be his department.

FALSE,B+,Can't Slow Down,Lionel Richie,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8283,"
Given Richie's well-established appeal to white people, this surprisingly solid album bids fair to turn into a mini-Thriller, and good for him--it's a real advance. In the years since he became a ballad writer he's learned how to sing them--""Hello"" is nowhere near as magical a song as ""Easy,"" but the grain of Richie's delivery gives you something to sink your ears into. And where the Commodores' funk often sounded a little forced, his jumpy international dance-pop comes to him naturally even when he's putting on that stupid West Indian accent.

FALSE,B+,Dancing on the Ceiling,Lionel Richie,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8284,"
Though it's customary to situate Richie square in the middle of the pop mainstream, in fact he's more austere than that, and more distinctive--his placidity and simplicity yield a lulling, almost mantralike entertainment that recalls Sade or J.J. Cale. Granted, his clich������������������d verse""Ballerina Girl"" is all too noticeable. And sometimes he doesn't put his heart into the semi-fast ones. But he compensates with a knack for tune that puts him over the fine line between lulling and boring--a knack that Sade or Cale would go metal for.

Well then, is this Lou Reed without chemicals or Loudon Wainwright III with a cold? If the former, he'd better renegotiate his right to be fey by balancing off each new LP with some rock 'n' roll drone (""Road Runner,"" say, or the Earth Quake cuts on Beserkley Chartbusters). And if the latter, there'd better be one funny song as astonishing as ""Pablo Picasso"" (or ""Rufus Is a Tit Man"") every time.

FALSE,B+,Rock & Roll With the Modern Lovers,Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7636,"
This all-acoustic record is even further in general tough-mindedness from Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers than that fey testament was from The Modern Lovers; it defines the difference between a child who is cute and a child who knows adults think children are cute. Sometimes I think I should hate it. But in fact I don't, because its self-indulgence represents not the manipulative arrogance of a star but rather the craziness of an almost powerless case of arrested development, and you can hear that. However unattractive a child Richman may be, he does convey the fragile lyricism only children are capable of.

In Australia she's been dubbed ""queen of jazz,"" which says more about Australia than it does about jazz. As does she--what's most appealing on this U.S. compilation is topical (and usually humorous) material about her native continent that's recommended to Nick Cave and Olivia Newton-John. But though she musters an impressively gruff blues timbre and on occasion some rudimentary swing, I'm not convinced she always goes flat on purpose, and when she emotes she may strain the credulity even of those who set their standards by Nick Cave and Olivia Newton-John.

Blues devotees wonder why Robinson, originator of what is now regarded as Boz Scaggs's classic and clearly a blues musician of courage, imagination, and skill, remains unknown off the circuit. Let me suggest some reasons: 1) He's so smart he gets a lot of mileage out of his voice, but the voice itself lacks power as an instrument and a dramatic vehicle. 2) His songs are well-written but hardly catchy; the closest this comes to a hook is the chordal ascent on ""Gotta Wake Up."" 3) His formal extensions are stylish and thoughtful, but he rarely lets loose and just has a good time.

Smokey has a right to the romanticism that has saturated his solo career--ick with kick has always been his specialty--but I get more from the Big Time soundtrack than from Smokey's Family Robinson. And then there's this, in which various Motown hacks attempt to approximate the bright, direct style of a less mature Smokey and come up with four songs (two of which begin each four-cut side) that actually do so. Whereupon Smokey, pro that he is, sings them as if he wrote them himself.

The tardy top-forty success of ""Crusin'""--plus maybe, who knows, an evocative title ������������������ la A Quiet Storm--has created the impression that the follow-up album's the comeback, but commercially and artistically that was last year's Where There's Smoke . . .

Aspiring popsters should welcome this proof that our greatest living poet is able to make do (and then some) with sneaky-fast melodies and rhythms and a vocal style of irreproachably guileless sophistication. Lets them off the, er, hook. Wordwise, that is. Not melodywise, rhythmwise, or voicewise.

FALSE,B+,Touch the Sky,Smokey Robinson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8295,"
Since his turn-of-the-decade renaissance, Smokey's been slipping back among the marginalia, where qualitative distinctions (better than Yes It's You Lady but not Being With You) get fine if not strictly personal. This one's recommended especially to cheating-song fans--""Gimme What You Want"" is defiant enough for Millie Jackson, ""All My Life's a Lie"" defeated enough for George Jones--though I'll admit that what pushed me over the line was the way the positivity of the title cut fades out on a pleading ""touch it, touch it"" that I'd swear aims lower than the sky.

The one about how much he wants to get next to a young thing who's been almost family since she was a baby is as convincing as ""Shop Around."" But with Smokey convincing doesn't necessarily have anything to do with factual. Which is the only reason ""And I Don't Love You"" (who else would begin a song ""The whippoorwill--whippoor won't""?), ""Gone Forever,"" and the agonizing ""I Can't Find"" don't have me worried (much) about him and Claudette. Sure there's filler, some of it written by Essar himself--he would try and get away with ""Close Encounters of the First Kind"" in 1984. But one thing you can say about Smokey's filler that you can't say about anybody else's--Smokey's singing it.

At first this seems disgracefully skimpy--six romantic ballads totalling 27:36, including a slow ""My Cherie Amour,"" a cover of Herb Alpert's vocal debut, and one count-it one (old Mary Wells) tune by Smokey himself, for title and ""concept."" Then you notice a gliss, a chuckle, a soulful paragraph or two, and realize that he's singing even more exquisitely than usual. Then, if you're me, you get annoyed at the Mo-on-the-town arrangements, with their full string sections and muted trumpets. And then, if you're me, you find yourself transformed by the urge to act as nice as Smokey himself.

Twelve songs, just like the old days, every one sweet and smooth and tinged with pain. And just like in the old days barely half of them are as vivid (musically or verbally) as hits like ""The Tears of a Clown"" or ""I Don't Blame You at All.""

If this live-double souvenir of Smokey's farewell tour with his group were the only Miracles record I owned I'd play it a lot. It totals less than an hour including patter and offers little that's new, but the show band gets through all the oldies with a minimum of extraneous swing and only on ""Shop Around"" does Smokey betray the kind of embarrassment that so frequently afflicts upwardly mobile performers reprising their teen hits. Good for him--he knows these are great songs, and he sings his ass off.

With its saxophone parts and enriched vocals, this reaffirms Robinson's affinities with cabaret after two albums of straight rock and roll and two inspired compromises with postmodernism. ""War Baby"" is a wrenching triumph and ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"" a great moment in gay liberation, but though it's nice that he sings ""Looking for a Bonfire"" and ""Listen to the Radio"" more affectingly than he did on North by Northwest, I'd rather he'd written more affectingly.

Positioned at four and six, the Max Martin-aided ""Show Me Love"" and ""Do You Know (What It Takes)"" are key, but without Robyn and her boys' ""Bumpy Ride,"" ""You've Got That Somethin',"" and ""The Last Time"" at one, three, and five you wouldn't listen twice. Then, a few spins in, you notice a hint of velvet in her timbre--more like suede, really--that suggests not sensuality but emotional depth. Which in turn makes the orchestrated popsongs about romantic responsibility sound thoughtful rather than mawkish. Too bad she'll turn 21 like every other teen idol.

Comprising six recent full-length dance tracks by the bandleader whose clarion baritone has made him the biggest singer in Zaire for twenty-five years, this is a well-designed compilation documenting Africa's dominant pop style. Most of the cuts have real tunes, with French lyrics accessible to a wide range of high school graduates, and two feature his female protegee M'bilia Bel.

""Love Radiates Around"" has a once-in-a-lifetime melody and was written by a pal of theirs, but its blissful sentiments don't suit this depressing compromise of a ""rock"" record any better than it would one of their Robert Fripp jobs. Even turning out songs on deadline they're sardonic weirdos, and though the material could be stronger, the monkey wrench is the received irrelevancy of the synthbeats and guitar solos furnished by three strangely indistinguishable production teams.

What's most distinct about the best jangle-pop band to surface in years is also what's weakest--the way the jangle-pop commonplaces ""sparkling,"" ""effervescent,"" and ""boisterous"" that adorn their raves don't actually apply. ""Addictive,"" yes, which is why admirers rave and why I'm giving them their due. Lyrically, the mood is basically melancholy, which in songs like the mournful ""Bellarine,"" the reminiscent ""Cappuccino City,"" the pro-immigrant ""Mainland,"" and my favorite, the love-out-of-reach ""Talking Straight"" are dark notes I'm inclined to suspect their stauncher fans don't feel, because that would dull their jangle-fix. FYI, the Hope Downs of the title is an iron reserve in Western Australia, but those words do have other resonances, don't they? Sub Pop connects them to ""the feeling of 'standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold onto.'"" The persistence of jangle-pop, for instance.

Back in '67 men were men and rock groups were rock groups: the Beatles ""long-awaited"" Sgt. Pepper appeared only nine months after Revolver and was followed by Christmas's Magical Mystery Tour, and the Stones released three albums. I don't propose to determine whether Between the Buttons and Flowers are A's or A pluses, but this one's a challenge--probably the most controversial LP they ever made, it features two communal jams of a most un-Stoneslike looseness, a (mock-?) psychedelic jacket, and a very subdued Mick Jagger. Really, Mick doesn't sing here, not expressively, he simply projects lead vocals through a filter which is one metaphorical equivalent for the sense of distance that is the album's obsession. A lot of people consider Satanic Majesties a, how you say it, bummer, but I'm fond of it; without a doubt it contains several great songs (""Citadel,"" ""2000 Man,"" ""2000 Light Years from Home,"" and Bill Wyman's ""In Another Land"").

Flowers it ain't, but Jamming With Edward it ain't either. The second side holds up better than the first, the sound and musicianship are rough and thin throughout, and most of the arrangements were obviously given up in the middle (remember One Plus One?), sometimes because the songs were worth giving up on. But Bill Wyman's ""Downtown Suzie"" and Oldham-Richards's ""I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys,"" to choose two previously unheard for all too obvious reasons, rank with all but the greatest Stones originals, and at its worst this still represents the world's greatest rock and roll band during the period when they were earning the title.

No one will ever mistake this for a great Stones album, but I bet it sounds more interesting than It's Only Rock 'n Roll should we take the time to compare and contrast in our respective retirement communities. The mid-'60s charm of such tossed-off tropes as ""Where the Boys Go"" and ""She's So Cold"" goes with music that's far more allusive and irregular and knowing: for better and worse its drive isn't so monolithic, and the bass comes front and center like Bill was James Jamerson.

Understandably, the material includes three meditative standards, and unsurprisingly, Rollins meditates up a storm at several speeds. The historical moment only intensifies his religious feelings about music; he's humble and masterful, questioning and joyous, swinging and polyrhythmic. Scott fits in, running changes with a satisfying physicality. But the heightened circumstances make clear that Anderson's main job in this band is to give the boss breathing room. And under the circumstances, there's too much of it.

FALSE,B+,War ina Babylon,Max Romeo,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7661,"
Romeo has long been a professional rude boy ina the Anglian outposts of Babylon, and this career training is reflected in the brightness of his reggae, refreshingly explicit and immediate (both musically and lyrically) in the wake of second-rate Toots and Marley. In fact, I find this album more attractive than all but two reggae LPs released stateside in 1976--the Mighty Diamonds and the first Burning Spear. But I won't argue with anyone who finds it tediously close in spirit to the foregone conclusions of Peter, Paul &amp; Mary.

FALSE,B+,Never Say Never,Romeo Void,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8310,"
This is no EP, it's a dance twelve-inch with three B sides nobody will remember. And nobody will remember anything about its reason for being except Debora Iyall lashing out with one ""I might like you better if we slept together"" after another. But that's not the reason they'll remember. They'll remember because of the beat, big drum doubling big guitar, and the sax breaks marking time. Which is quite enough.

FALSE,B+,Greatest Hits,Linda Ronstadt,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7668,"
Because it compiles work from both Capitol and Asylum, I anticipated an ideal sampler, especially when the first side induced me to enjoy ""Desperado,"" which she sings real purty. But the second side features her inferior versions of no less than three songs, suggesting that one might be better off obtaining her best music from its corporation of origin.

FALSE,B+,Simple Dreams,Linda Ronstadt,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7670,"
In which Andrew Gold goes off and Pursues His Solo Career, enabling Ronstadt to hire herself a rock and roll band. She's still too predictable--imagine how terse and eloquent ""Blue Bayou"" would seem if instead of turning up the volume midway through she just hit one high note at the end--but she's also a pop eclectic for our time, as comfortable with Mick Jagger as with Dolly Parton, interpreting Roy Orbison as easily as Buddy Holly. Even her portrayal of a junkie seeking succor from Warren Zevon's ""Carmelita"" isn't totally ridiculous. And I admit it--she looks great in a Dodger jacket.

FALSE,B+,A Retrospective,Linda Ronstadt,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7669,"
Safe (five cuts from Heart Like a Wheel, worth owning itself), genteel (six from Linda Ronstadt, her most conventional album for the label), and occasionally tasteless (""Hobo"" is pure artysong and ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" failed nostalgia), this is nevertheless a listenable compilation. ""Lovesick Blues"" and ""Rescue Me"" rock a lot better than ""Heat Wave,"" the Stone Poneys stuff surpasses that on Different Drum, Capitol's 1968 ""Silver Threads and Golden Needles"" sounds fresher than Asylum's 1973, and the genteel stuff does mix well, as they say.

FALSE,B+,Things Fall Apart,The Roots,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3848,"
Stop the violence in hip hop, but make an exception if these guys will shoot the piano player. Kamal gets away with his omnipresent ostinato beds here mostly because the band is looking back to the old-school rap they loved before they discovered jazz lite. They even sample now and then--I've never been so happy to run into Schoolly-D in my life. What's so consistently annoying on their earlier intelligent records is almost hooky on this one, integral to a flow that certainly does just that, which isn't to say you won't be relieved when it rocks the house instead. Gee--maybe they've gotten more intelligent.
"
FALSE,B+,Undun,The Roots,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15536,"
It speaks well for their strength of mind that Jimmy Fallon hasn't just been good for their economic viability--he's been good for their music. But superb though their 2008 and 2010 records were, and admirable though their equipoise has been, concept albums are such sinkholes that the partial success of this reverse-chronological tale of a doomed small-time hood is more surprising than its partial failure. Maybe I could work out plausible meanings for every song like some exegete brushing the cobwebs off ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands."" But all song cycles have holes in them, and really, just exactly what level of sagacity do we expect from Black Thought--or Bob Dylan, for that matter? What I get from Black Thought, as usual, is flashes of insight and articulated feeling. The sharpest verse here is Dice Raw's on ""One Time,"" which along with ""The Otherside"" is the closest the song cycle comes to a stand-alone song. So what I get from the album as a whole isn't a feel for the fictional Redford Stephens. It's the pop refrains, Euro orchestrations, and simplified drumming absorbed by a sound that shows no sign of standing pat.

"
FALSE,B+,Lady Sings the Blues,Diana Ross,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7677,"
Billie Holiday is uncoverable, possibly the greatest singer of the century, yet the fact is that Ross's versions--which occupy only two sides of this soundtrack album--are intensely listenable. That's the word I want, because it doesn't fit Holiday, who either seizes your full attention or disturbs you in the background. While copying Holiday's phrasing and intonation, Ross smoothes them out, making the content easier to take without destroying it altogether. This may be a desecration and a deception, but it speaks to the condition of a ghetto child who's always had a talent for not suffering, for willing herself up and through. Not every singer turns into a junkie, after all.

FALSE,B+,Diana Ross' Greatest Hits,Diana Ross,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7680,"
I'd hoped this would drag me kicking and giggling to rock and roll perdition, just like the old Motown best-ofs. Instead I found I had to learn to like it. Which I did, eventually--these are good pop tunes for the most part, and her ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" sounds more valid now than it did when Marvin &amp; Tammi were fresh in my ear. But rock and roll perdition is beside the point, because this isn't rock and roll.
"
FALSE,B+,Diana & Marvin,Diana Ross & Marvin Gaye,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7683,"
Motown's record division could really put out some terrific albums if the publishing division wasn't always butting in. Of the six Motown-composed tracks, only Ashford &amp; Simpson's ""Just Say, Just Say"" and the hit, ""My Mistake,"" have any charm of their own. But this girl-boy duo sound just great on two Bell-Creed songs and the follow-up single, Wilson Pickett's ""Don't Knock My Love."" And while I suspect it was Marvin who edged Diana into the warmest and loosest--and streetest--performance of her career, maybe it was just the proximity of ""Pledging My Love.""

FALSE,B+,Eat 'Em and Smile,David Lee Roth,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8316,"
With everybody from Patti to Belinda to Peter to Eldra kissing pop's ass, Roth gives it a pinch and keeps on trucking. Maybe because he lived out his wimpier fantasies on last year's EP, here he's free to mastermind his own piece of multiplatinum potential. Sure he covers ""That's Life,"" but he also assembles a metal band that'll cut old buddies: Maynard Ferguson drummer, cult heaven bassist, and on guitar former Zappa and Lydon sideman Steve Vai, who splits the difference between parody and virtuosity. I mean, Vai is funny without opening his mouth. And of course, so is our voluble auteur, who makes Miss Liberty a burlesque queen and neither lady a whore.
"
FALSE,B+,Too-Rye-Ay,Kevin Rowland and Dexys Midnight Runners,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8319,"
Rowland's arrangements are impossibly busy and his vocals impossibly mannered, but on this record he does the impossible--makes me believe he's found some young soul rebels. The unison horn voicings and post-Stax fiddles impart an underlying simplicity that'll pass for Celtic, and if Rowland swoops and swerves where a real soul singer would just emote, his earnestness prevails anyway.
"
FALSE,B+,Roxy Music,Roxy Music,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3023,"
From the drag queen on the cover to the fop finery in the centerfold to the polished deformity of the music on the record, this celebrates the kind of artifice that could come to seem as unhealthy as the sheen on a piece of rotten meat. Right now, though, it's decorated with enough weird hooks to earn an A for side one. Side two leans a little too heavily on the synthesizer (played by a balding, long-haired eunuch lookalike named Eno) without the saving grace of drums and bassline.
"
FALSE,B+,Stranded,Roxy Music,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3026,"
Any artist as oblique and ambitious as Bryan Ferry deserves an oblique, ambitious review, here provided (unintentionally) by Sidney Tillem in his ""Figurative Art 1969: Aspects and Prospects"": ""By moral in the context of art I mean a style which executes the deeper social and psychological function of form, as opposed to a particular aspect of vanity called taste. Pop sensibility, pop consciousness, pop sentimentality have been invaluable in clarifying the provincialism and nostalgia that actually permeate a culture that has come to pride itself on sophistication. But they have not resulted in a new art simply because the requisite idealism has been lacking.""
"
FALSE,B+,Country Life,Roxy Music,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3025,"
The Teutoni-textures of this music are proof negative of Bryan Ferry's deep-seated romanticism. But what happens when romanticism goes sour? And what is Phil Manzanera doing on that Nico record that closes with her version of ""Deutschland Uber Alles""? Oh well, I've always said good rock has to be dangerous. But when did I say it could be slow?

FALSE,B+,The High Road,Roxy Music,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3032,"
At 26:28, a generous live mini. Limber amplifications of the putatively impassioned ""Can't Let Go"" and the formerly unbearable ""My Only Love"" grace the A. ""Like a Hurricane"" and ""Jealous Guy"" redefine the parameters of rocksy retro on the B. Next time you want to hear Bryan croon or Phil wail, take a flier.

Borrows ""Do the Strand"" from For Your Pleasure (originally on Reprise, fellas) and ""Love Is the Drug"" from Siren and Greatest Hits, the better to showcase Roxy Music the creamy dance band. I wouldn't swear it's a better album than Manifesto, from which it appropriates four cuts. But I would swear it's a better album than Flesh + Blood, from which it also appropriates four cuts.

FALSE,B+,Omerta,Royal Crescent Mob,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8321,"
Although those who think all funk sounds the same might confuse them with, er, Cameo, unlike other umpteenth generation new-wavers they have identity to burn. Say they're '60s types hip enough to have learned their wacked-out anarchy from Pedro Bell's mid-'70s psychedelic cartoons. Partly because funk gets over on a groove more muscular than they can cut and partly because they put their all into a self-manufactured EP, only ""Get On the Bus,"" which also led the EP, and ""Mob's Revenge,"" for an ass-grabbing asshole and featuring a rousing ""You're fucked"" refrain, belong on their best-of. But their identity comes this close to carrying them over the top anyway.
"
FALSE,B+,"Something New, Old and Borrowed",Royal Crescent Mob,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8322,"
The borrowed is the largely legendary Land of Sugar, now available only as a Play It Again Sam import. The new is a Richard Gottehrer-produced single, half generic white funk, half sui generis garage pop. The old is five cuts ""live at the fair,"" though just exactly which fair is left unspecified. I smell a ringer right down to the wild cheers for the James Brown cover and the cries of ""You suck,"" though the Led Zep cover and the vamp-with-intro about corn dogs and heat-vs.-humidity certainly do the concept proud.

FALSE,B+,Rufusized,Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7689,"
Chaka's got a mostly new, mostly black band, and it makes a difference, especially in the in-house songwriting, with hooks courtesy guitarist Tony Maiden. The lyrics are worth catching, too, especially the answer to ""Rocket Man,"" in which the wife croons ""The universe is calling you"" without a hint of sarcasm. Guess that's what assuming the spiritual mannerisms of Stevie and Aretha--launching your voice into free fall, I mean--can bring you to.
"
FALSE,B+,Live--Stompin' at the Savoy,Rufus and Chaka Khan,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8326,"
Especially since ""Ain't Nobody,"" the killer hit her last album cried out for, comes courtesy of Rufus's main man Hawk Wolinski, this reunion is like a gift--for three sides live and one studio she's finally free of her freedom. It's not the '70s best-of a cynical admirer like myself might wish, but the material is stronger than anything she's compiled with Arif Mardin for sure, and ""Ain't That Peculiar"" is a complete natural. But beyond ""Ain't Nobody,"" Wolinski contributes nothing special songwise. Which I guess is one reason she wanted her freedom.
"
FALSE,B+,King of Rock,Run-D.M.C.,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3053,"
You can tell these guys are real rock-and-rollers because they sounded so much fresher before they got what they wanted, and you can tell they didn't get it all because their rhymes still make a lot of sense sometimes--especially ""You're Blind,"" a protest for and at the ghetto rather than about it. But their well-timed ""You Talk Too Much"" routine runs aground on stupid insults (""nagging wife,"" gosh) and old jokes (""Why don't you find a short pier/And take a long walk,"" groan). ""It's Not Funny"" is either a perverse albeit well-named joke or a complete washout. Even the boasts run thin. ""Take airplane flights/At huge heights""? I mean, what do sucker MC's do? Just taxi around the runway?
"
FALSE,B+,Tougher Than Leather,Run-D.M.C.,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3055,"
Coming off their sophomore jinx and out to prove their mastery, they ended up celebrating it as well; coming off their triumph and feeling too damn big for their minor label, they merely demonstrate it. Technically, the kings are nonpareils--not a duff beat or a forced rhyme. But for the moment they lack desire. I'll enjoy the genre-busting side-closers anywhere, the original-metal title tune and anticrime message on the radio, and the rest later.
"
FALSE,B+,Down With the King,Run-D.M.C.,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3057,"
A triumphant comeback, but the comeback is spiritual and the triumph formal, which adds up to art rather than culture. Where multiple producers usually signal overweening identity crisis, this is debt collection--since rap as we know it proceeded from their innovations and accommodations, there's no one in the music who doesn't owe them. And though the two Bomb Squad cuts owe Cypress Hill in turn, all the other guest overseers--Q-Tip, Jermaine Dupri, Pete Rock, EPMD--drop plenty flavor without impinging on the group's aural identity. Sure of their hard-not-gangsta ethos, equally deliberate in the vocals and the bass and drums, they always sound like Jay, Run, and Darryl Mac. Yet with their own spare production style signifying only as a trademark, they live off those outside shots, and the boasts about the stages they useta rip up ring truer than the ones about the trends they're gonna start. I hope their godfather status is good for sales as well as respect, influence as well as sales. But I wonder how much their return will mean, even to rap aesthetes, if it isn't.

I know it wouldn't be an authentic disco album without filler, but he's too blandly male a singer to put over pro forma romance. The exception is ""Supernatural,"" as you'll figure out if you match title to persona and consider the possibilities. And when he cops an attitude--on five cuts by my count, culminating in the deep-dish ""A Shade Shady""--he brings off a time-warped genderfuck all his own.

FALSE,B+,So Many Roads,Otis Rush,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7700,"
Rush has been the bluesfan's bluesman for years, but this album--recorded live in Hibiya Park, Tokyo, a/k/a Pepper's Lounge East--is the first time I've been able to hear why. Reason's simple--lots of room for his guitar. Rush is a ""good singer"" with a ""good instrument""--sweet, penetrating, slurred--but the words aren't where his soul goes. It goes into the form itself. Like B.B. King's, only less predictably by now, his solos expand upon the Chicago verities in almost jazzlike flights without ever transgressing against them.
"
FALSE,B+,Brenda Russell,Brenda Russell,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7702,"
If it's pop you crave, slow down a minute and check this out--eight love songs, all in sensual-to-pert medium tempos, all sweetly hooky. Russell's singing is breathy, soulish, and trickier than it seems, and though her lyrics are sometimes quite clumsy, they always sound felt and particular. Even the string arrangements avoid the vague and saccharine, especially those by David Wolfert, who produced Dusty Springfield's best album of the '70s. The material isn't as powerful, but this reminds me more than a little of Dusty's best album of the '60s, and that's high praise.

This is weirder than what you'd expect from a man whose Phil Spector savvy and slick gospel piano have helped stabilize both Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Joe Cocker. Russell has all of Mick Jagger's whine and shriek and none of his power, so while the singing is distinctive, and valid, it grates--impressive material from ""Dixie Lullaby"" and ""Shoot Out on the Plantation"" would simply be more so with other vocals. If not Delaney, Bonnie, or Joe, how about Marc Benno?

From ""Roll Away the Stone,"" more iconoclastic than Mott the Hoople's, to ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" more iconoclastic than Robert Heinlein's, the first side reminds you what an uncommon rock and roller he can be. But on side two, which yokes ""A Song for You,"" ""This Masquerade,"" and ""Hummingbird"" to three potboilers from Will o' the Wisp, you realize that his iconoclasm was (is?) as accidental as his standards.

Always defiantly thin both sonically and conceptually, M.I.A.'s best sidekick forever is an ideal conduit for a Bmore electro that doubles as the sound of ingrained urban poverty--a poverty complemented by a few throw-in anthems that use electronics to simulate affluence instead. Finally we've reached a tipping point resembling the riot grrrl moment of the early '90s, one in which every feisty hip-hop soprano has a you-go-illygirl edge on her notebook-toting male competitors. Selling point of the unfortunately download-only deluxe: two singsongy old M.I.A. collabs that drive the point home.

Instrumentally and vocally, these three Virginia over-40s are folkies. Ann Rabson's woogie piano and Gaye Adegbalola's unamplified guitar are high-generic only--their originality is in their feminist redefinition of blues-circuit raunch. Never again do they get as lewd or as fine as ""Middle Aged Blues Boogie,"" in which Adegbalola stakes her claim on that good young cock (and tongue) as if it was her right as a fully sexed human being, but there's a matter-of-fact candor to ""Fess Up When You Mess Up"" and ""School Teacher's Blues"" that's rare among younger guitar poets. And if Rabson has decided in her considerable wisdom never to take care of another man, only an MCP could blame her.

Look at it this way--if the Atlantic genius factory hadn't tried to transform this all-time ready-steady-go into a '70s folk hero, Mercury would never have hashed together these Quintet rejects. Apparently the potential singles were already used up--covers of Roy Sharpe's ""Linda Lu"" and Tom T. Hall's ""The Homecoming"" are the standouts. But every one is as unkempt and wonderful as the rest of Doug's Mercury stuff.

Saint Prix's chouval bwa rhythm is an uncle of zouk, much less high-tech even in this modernized version and a little light for my tastes--the leader counts the flute among his accomplishments, and rarely does his keyboardist rev up high enough to drown one out.

Jack Antonoff or no Jack Antonoff, pop-tailored synth sonics do not a pop album make, and artist avowals to the contrary, being personal requires more than the will to do so--it takes a certain kind of talent, one of the few Annie Clark may not possess. Big choruses you find yourself humming? But of course. Alluring lyrics that walk the tightrope of legibility? She passes that test. So there's not a track here that isn't manifestly memorable and intelligent. What's missing is the more amorphous and lowbrow aesthetic quality called accessibility. It's certainly possible to imagine fans in the hundreds of thousands aspiring to Clark's latest self-presentation. But the smaller number who identify with her are deluding themselves--she's a genius and they're not, and she's proud of it. So admiring every song though I do, I warm to precisely two: the one hooked to her ""I can't turn off what turns me on,"" an endangered principle or is it compulsion in this sociosexual moment, and the imploring ""please""s moaned by the putative top in the sadie-maisie cosplay tale ""Savior.""

Tugboat-like, his material chugs so steadily that I bet few under 35 will cotton to it, and he never tops a six-minute opener that chronicles the enduring love of a banker and a short-order cook.

More confident and hence more fun than Caravanserai, this proves that a communion of multipercussive rock and transcendentalist jazz can move the unenlightened--me, for instance. Good themes, good playing, good beat, and let us not forget good singing--Leon Thomas's muscular spirituality grounds each side so firmly that not even Flora Purim can send it out the window.

FALSE,B+,Moonflower,Santana,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7721,"
Mixing greatest oldies with lesser newcomers, salsa classics with rock covers, European concert hall with San Fran studio, this seamless double album should stand as the working definition of a world-class band. My objections stand, too--the improvisations sometimes divert when they should sustain, the groove is often too easy, and the vocal ensembles sound like commercials. But all these flaws, for better or worse, suit music of such global appeal. And Carlos Santana has never played so well for so long. In the rock guitar tradition he is less a man of style than of sound, a clear, loud, fluent sound that cleanses with the same motion no matter how often that motion is repeated--as long as the intensity and the context are there. On this album, the live cuts provide both.

Like Chuck Berry's, Santana's lexicon of licks has never guaranteed entertaining improvisation, and the square rhythms of his one-shot roots rock &amp; roll &amp; band (MG's and Thunderbirds converge on Muscle Shoals) flatter his guitar as aptly as any funkbeat. You'll still find solo atmospherics here, but at least this time they take after Booker T. rather than Sri C. And though the vocals go to damn near everybody but Carlos himself--Booker T., Kim Wilson, Carlos's dad, even Greg Walker, heretofore the finest singer ever to drop in on him--it's Willie Nelson who shows us what for, on a country tune that's the one cut on the album which completely transcends revivalism.

His renown as the man who brought black-tie New Year's to Bay Area haute bohemia seems a fitting climax to a career that's transformed Marin County languor into the hippest in pop cool. Listening back to his biggest tunes, the best of which (except for the mean, jaunty pimp-song ""Jojo"") seem to have been recorded in the mid-'70s, you can hear everything from old compatriot Sly Stone to more recent compatriot Elton John. But many of his ""hits,"" in case you didn't notice, were recorded right here in 1980, and so this collection includes three from Middle Man, one from Urban Cowboy, and one brand new fabrication. Silk Degrees isn't as tuneful. But when I want to remember how Marin County languor converted the masses, that's what I'll play.

Admirers of Red Crayola's Kangaroo?, the only album in history based on Marxist art criticism, will find this hauntingly familiar, not just in its often arcane leftism but in its apparent indifference to musical niceties like vocal pitch. Its pleasures are manifold, and its variety not of the obvious sort you might expect from four guys who play twenty-eight instruments. They combine awkwardness and grace, comedy and admonition, intellect and grunge in politically enlightened proportions. And borrow their pithiest lyric from Mao Tse-Tung.

My opposition to ""good"" voices is well-documented, and I admittedly find it impossible to hear the alternative I pine for in my mind's ear--something sweeter, softer, more murmured. (Paul Simon half an octave lower and cleansed of the cutes? Never mind.) But I know damn well I'd enjoy their pomo chamber-rock more if the singer could carry a tune. There--I said it and I'm glad.

From the beginning, rap has been a music of aggressive, expansive possibility, claiming the world on beat and boast alone. This Philadelphia street tough claims only his turf. His powerful scratch rhythms are as oppressive and constricted as his neighborhood, and his sullen slur conveys no more hope or humor than the hostile egotism of his raps themselves. I'm not saying he isn't realer than all the cheerful liars the biz has thrown back to the projects, or that his integrity doesn't pack a mean punch. But he's still an ignorant thug, and he's cheating both his audience and himself by choosing to remain that way.

FALSE,B+,Country Fiddle Band,Gunther Schuller,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7740,"
Why do I love this semiclassicized perversion when country fiddle and bluegrass music that strives for authenticity leaves me cold? It's all in the candor of the striving; as usual, I'm put off by the way so-called folk groups formalize a tradition that had spontaneity and unselfconsciousness at the root of its attraction. This silly symphony is something else. The melodies are fetchingly tried-and-true, the (unintentional?) stateliness of the rhythms appropriately nineteenth-century, and the instrumental overkill (twenty-four instruments massed on ""Flop-Eared Mule"") both gorgeous and hilarious. A grand novelty.

In the wake of willful hype and confused debut, this follow-up has been panned or ignored, an injustice. I'm impressed that four English guys could get the Byrds' kind of bittersweet, covertly strange c&amp;w so right, though actually it's not so different from what the Stones started doing with r&amp;b.

Great start: two songs in which gender spirals down the rabbit hole are followed by a Pink Floyd cover done Bee Gees-style. These star-time party boys never get brasher, funnier, or better, and their midtempo Elton isn't ironic enough.

Where American Honey is lascivious, the second album by this Houston rapper whose Lamborghini I've never understood is jutht plain thilly. Celebrating the women he fucks on the drugs and alcohol the real-life Travis supposedly eschews, the rapper-organizer taps a raft of people who owe him something, and if they're somewhat less august than DJ Khaled's band of toadies, they get more done as they establish Auto-Tune as the human side of screwed-and-chopped. Universal pitch correction makes it harder to tell one rapper from another even as big names Kendrick Lamar and Young Thug nail focus tracks. So let's hear it for 21 Savage and Kid Cudi too.

The ""hairy-armed women's liberationists"" of the title track are still with us, but at least this compilation avoids the fag-baiting that dishonored his first album, not the only sign of growth.

Never would have believed it, but the switch from Brian Jackson's supportive groove to Carl Cornwell's elliptical horn charts adds intellectual and historical weight to the songs that merely say good things as well as those that put them pungently. The two that constitute the latter category kick this off like the great album he's got in him.

""'B' Movie,"" his smartest political rap ever, is also his first airplay hit since ""Angel Dust,"" maybe because black radio cherishes no expectation of crossing over to Ray-Gun. Hooray. But no less than four cuts--the jazz and reggae tributes as well as the Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye covers--are diminished by the mere serviceability of Scott-Heron's post-Brian Jackson musical conception (execution?), because each invokes the power of music that only becomes truly powerful when it's more than serviceable. That's not to say each of them isn't of service, though.

This is what happened to Pharoah Sanders and I say yeah. The danceability of Jackson's music reifies the tribal aspirations of new-thing avant-gardism just as Scott-Heron's talent for modest analysis brings all that cosmic politicking down to earth. Also, I'm really getting to like Scott-Heron's singing--his instrument will never equal Leon Thomas's or Pharoah's, but that's not what it's about.

Scott-Heron stokes the protest-music flame more generously than any son of Woody, and in sheer agitprop terms ""Angel Dust,"" one of those black-radio hits that somehow never crossed over, is his triumph--haunting music of genuine political usefulness. Of course, it would be hard to imagine the Arista promo team busting its butt to get ""Third World Revolution"" on the air as a follow-up, even if it had a hook, but I'll settle for a tribulations-of-stardom song with an educational refrain: ""Do you really want to be in show bizness?""

Last year's Good and Gone import EP was too perfect for neogarage, too formally aware to get rough enough, but here (with two of the EP's best reprised) these pros seem like a different kind of tribute band--not Garageland Calling but London Sandinistas, strictly roots punks who can really play their axes. I don't mean ex-punks, either. They bury those roots except when they need a hook, and age has not withered nor custom staled their compulsion to snarl at the military-industrial complex and the girl next door.

Despite lyrics beholden to Mark Lanegan's attention-grabbing baritone, a big spooky aspiring commodity fetish that puts quantity before quality in the feeling department, these Northwest veterans have started roiling and hooking and knocking 'em dead at the very moment they seemed ready to expire of corporate torpor--not Kurt &amp; Co., but definitely good for a fix. It isn't just songs, which are in evidence on their SST best-of and discernible on their Epic product, and before you credit the production, which must help some, ask yourself why Don Fleming can't do the same for Gumball.

Seals will never be a Muddy Waters or B.B. King, and his fifth LP lacks the edge of Midnight Son or Live and Burning. But he's such an impassioned craftsman he makes the distinction problematic, and he doesn't stand still--this time he's singing tenderly enough to bring off the self-servingly sentimental ""I Can Count on My Blues."" Which I guess he can.

They sing, they rap, they sex it up; they honor Rob Base and Taana Gardner with subtle samples and proud savoir-faire. I say the murmured ""a mountain of spices in the arms of the desired"" could almost be Coleridge (all right, Rossetti). My wife says it sounds like Sidney Sheldon. And therein lies their charm.

The gears that never quite mesh in this disquieting but hardly apocalyptic industrial ambient may be metal and may be plastic but are probably both. Over steady drumming with a martial feel, they evoke two kinds of bum transmission, one automotive and the other an AM station breaking up on a late-night four-lane. Phones ring occasionally. Doors squeak. Pretty people murmur and croon. But that bird you hear chirping isn't--isn't chirping, isn't a bird. Think the part of a Tricky album that's no way funky. Stabilized by nary a foolish word, the unease is so unapocalyptic it's almost comforting.

FALSE,B+,Conversations With Kenny & The Legacy of Lee,Serengeti,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14713,"
There's one problem with this concept album: It's a genuine sequel, so that those who don't already know middle-aged white guy Kenny from Dennehy may have trouble relating to him as he descends into a 12-step funk. No such problem with his new acquaintance Lee, an African-American with entrepreneurial dreams of escaping his sanitation job by opening a laundromat. Sincere and clueless, Lee is defeated every which way, first by in-laws who turn Bubbles &amp; Fun into a crack bazaar, but even worse in the end by the sincere, clueless white bohemian chick he hooks up with. Whether sampled or electro, Tony Trimm's beats lend not just musical presence but groove and a few hooks to plotting more nuanced than any summary can suggest. Hip-hop is regularly extolled for its storytelling, and there are individual tracks that justify the hype. But Serengeti's understanding of character development substantially surpasses that of, to name a personal favorite, Ghostface Killah. Even with lesser beats, it would make him a rapper worth seeking out.

B) Ronnie Biggs singing ""Belsen Vos a Gassa"" is at least as entertaining as Johnny Rotten singing ""Belsen Was a Gas.""

Like her stepmother, Mauritanian iggawin queen Dimi Mint Abba, Seymali has one of those foghorn voices that wears you down after it's knocked you over. Complete lyrics probably wouldn't help that much, but not knowing every word hurts. So what kept this album in the play pile for me was less the singing than the band, which with Seymali playing a traditional females-only harp is anchored by another hereditary griot, her guitarist husband Jeiche Ould Chighaly. Justly, they regard theirstyle as a modernizing, genre-bending ""fusion."" In fact, the musician who stands out mans a trap set. His name is Matthew Tinari, he's from Pennsylvania, and he manages them. Good for him.

I prefer Go for It's soft-spoken groove, but the brilliant vocals and processed high-end percussion of their latest crossover move are an up.

This semipro is an accomplished musician and a better writer. Otherwise, couldn't no concept lift him out of the generic welter of New Orleans bluesmen plying their trade in an entertainment center with scanter historical claim on blues--as opposed to jazz, funk, rock and roll, and countless pianistic celebrations of the second line--than Memphis or Houston, Clarksdale or Chicago. But what distinguishes Shannon's songs about his love life and his work life, Oprah Winfrey and his right to sing the blues, is their context--taped conversations from the back of his cab with locals who've seen their pleasures ruined by the pleasure industry and out-of-town assholes who got their idea of revelry from old tit magazines. Makes one wonder how much joy can be left in a city fogged in by the rosy mirage of a tourist economy. And gives Mem Shannon the right to sing the blues.

By replacing the three heaviest losers on the English LP with three catchy little numbers, American Arista has come up with what might be the most interesting case of great-song-plus since Billy Swan's I Can Help. Shelley's voice is definitely harder to take wobbling around this discofied electropop than outshrieking the Buzzcocks' guitars, but the one-man groove suits his marginally solipsistic homophile romanticism quite neatly.

On a Milanese label distributed stateside by the good folk of Record People (66 Greene Street), this combines more of Shepp's chronic poetry-with-jazz with a nice boppish number on one side while the sax-solo-over-Latin-riff of your dreams flows over some 26 minutes on the other. Simple to execute, but I'm glad somebody bothered. It's danceable, too--but does it have disco potential?

Benga is a vaguer term than the notes suggest, indicating any modern Kenyan dance-pop, not just Luo but Kamsa or Luhya or Kikuyu, that moves the light and rather folkish Kenyan guitar sound toward the big-time West African competition as it explores tribal rhythms of more meaning to Kenyans than to us. Without their guitarist-leader, self-crowned ""King of Benga,"" Owino Misiani, Shirati Jazz recut some hits in London for this collection, a good thing in what is largely an ill-recorded singles music. They do sound light and rather folkish to me--delicate without juju's cosmopolitan intricacy, rhythmic without mbaqanga's urban drive. But in exotics, charm counts for plenty.

And you have to hand it to those Japanese--without much depth to account for, the audio ain't bad. And maybe you should hand it to Shocked too. She's got more vocal personality than is common among solo folk, her guitar accomps her wherever she goes, and though she may be a little long on folkie mythos (sleeping in the park, guys with tattoos, etc.), she has a reporter's eye and a tale-spinner's ear.

Personally, I'm sorry she chickened out of doing the cover in blackface, because it would have added yet another fucked-up twist to her impossibly confused attempt to sort out American music's racial debts. After all, her confusion is no more impossible than anybody else's, just further out there, and at least the opacity of her pontifications on minstrelsy illustrates how deep the mysteries run. As someone who knows a fair amount about minstrelsy, I'd point out that most of its tunes were written by whites, albeit whites who aped and/or stole from blacks, or anyway (speaking of confusion), claimed to--after 1860, 'twas oft complained that newer minstrels weren't faux-darkie enough. And as someone who'd like to know more, I wish Shocked had said damn the copyright lawyers and detailed the sources of all her new songs, which--except for the gnomic ""Arkansas Traveler"" on the up side and the preachy ""Strawberry Jam"" on the down--are at their best when they seem influenced but not imitated. ""Prodigal Daughter"" out of ""Cotton-Eyed Joe"" is a coup--hooray. But is there a sense in which the equally praiseworthy ""Come a Long Way"" is also a rewrite? Or did those notes just float in from the ether?

Fine bit-by-bit, with worthwhile bonus goodies (especially the four from the import-only Silhouette) and unexceptionable sequencing and selection, its generous length places an impossible burden on these quintessentially slight popsters, reducing them to the light background entertainment those with no tolerance for fragility thought they were to begin with.

She sings as a woman, a man, a who-can-tell; she rhymes ""broken"" with ""Yoakam"" and ""buck up"" with ""fuck up.""

Essentially a producer-composer rather than a performer, Sigerson pursues AORish rockcraft and studio-guaranteed aesthetic distance in the manner of such paradigmatic early-'70s ironists as Randy Newman and Fagen-Becker--but also, before you get your hopes too high, John Simon and Terry Melcher. His theme song is ""My True Feelings"" (""are whatever you think you see""); his themes are both hooky (musically) and kinky (verbally). At his best (""Over and Over""), he proves how life-affirming the hookily kinky can be; at his worst (""Danish Modern""), he proves how weak-minded irony can be.

Beneath a lusher surface, her voice enriched with overdubs and less idiosyncratically accented, Sill has become a real militant. Christ is a ""Soldier of the Heart,"" a ""Vigilante"": although ""the chosen are few"" we're supposed to ""see how His mercy shines,"" presumably because he saves any of us sinners at all. Last shall be first or not, this is pretty repulsive as ideology, yet until the kyrie eleisons at the climax I find it paradoxically seductive.

All I know about this predominantly black group is that its home town is Munich, in Germany, and that its current single, ""Fly, Robin, Fly,"" is currently, well, taking off. The style is very bare and pure, sort of minimal disco, with lyrics so simple-minded they couldn't have been devised by anyone who knows English as a native language.

Quite consciously--why do you think the new single is so equivocal about the phony hues Kodachrome lays on reality?--Simon sacrifices the manic-depressive range of his solo debut in search of an equivalent for S&amp;G's all-encompassing homiletic pleasantness. The vocals are softer, smoothed over with borrowed or double-tracked harmonies, and the pep shots from more specialized styles (by the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Onward Brass Band) less speedy. The lyrics celebrate domestic satisfactions and seem to find political ambiguities more curious than ominous. None of which is bad or dishonest--it suggests a new grace and flexibility for the mass-pop mode, and invests small subjects and emotions with an almost luminous wit and awareness. But I have my doubts about Kodachrome too.

I like Mick Hucknall enough to not want to mention that there are only two songs on this album--one by David Byrne, one by the Valentine Brothers, both of which he runs away with. And until the last two tracks--the finale is ""Picture Book"" itself, which wanders worst of all--he and his Brit soulsters carry it off on mood and groove alone, and with hardly a love song, either.

Exactly how deep you find his songs depends on whether you find Waylon Jennings more moving than George Jones or Willie Nelson and the extent of your attraction to psychedelic drugs and Tibetan or any other kind of Buddhism. ""Turtles All the Way Down"" is one of the great tripping songs. ""It Ain't All Flowers"" is trip-hop country. And when he says love is all that matters I believe he means it. But I didn't need him to tell me that. I'd just as soon he tell me about coal mining, or what must be an interesting marriage.

Hippies were rainbow extremists; punks are romantics of black-and-white. Hippies forced warmth; punks cultivate cool. Hippies kidded themselves about free love; punks pretend that s&amp;m is our condition. As symbols of protest, swastikas are no less fatuous than flowers. So it's not surprising that Siouxsie Sioux, punks' exemplary fan-turned-artist, should prove every bit as pretentious as model-turned-rocker Grace Slick or film-student manqu������������������ Jim Morrison.

Like Jim Morrison, greatest of the pop posers, Siouxsie Pseud disguises the banality of her exoticism with psychedelic gimmicks most profitably consumed at their hookiest, and voila. Although two of the four unavailable-on-album 45s on this compilation go nowhere, most of these nightmare vignettes are diverting placebos, of a piece even though they span three years of putative artistic development.

Having embraced Doug's sloppiness, do we now penalize him for getting it together? It's a shock to hear him make like a big-band singer, but on the two opening cuts (both self-composed and -produced) he sounds enough like a good one to remind me that Texas was famous for ""territory bands"" in the '40s. And while the Quintet-style side two is never quite inspired, it's never less than competent fun. Yeah, competent--the singing especially has the kind of force and definition he's always rendered irrelevant in the past. His old fans don't need this record. But those who've always found him ragged might just go for it.

The hallmark of Doug Sahm's warm, reliable, steady-rocking Tex-Mex is that it always sounds like you've heard it before--not the lyrics, which Doug just jotted down on some rolling papers five minutes ago, but the riffs. This can drive you crazy--""Nuevo Laredo"" is ""Mendocino,"" obviously, but where the hell does ""Revolutionary Ways"" come from? When the mood is right, though, it gives the music a kind of folkish inevitability that doesn't get boring because Tex-Mex is such a stew of influences. This is way too loose, and forget the slow ones, but what fun.

Prey to moralizing condescension like all self-appointed spokespersons for the downtrodden, Jamaica's female dub poets do enjoy one advantage over their brethren--they see through the male supremacism that suffuses the island's alternative culture as well as its official ideology. This former schoolmarm leads both sides of Heartbeat's 1986 Woman Talk anthology on conceptual reach alone, and here she gets to put her theatrical experience to work, impersonating both a big-talking petty criminal and a girl from the hills gone paranoid schizophrenic in NYC. The riddyms and the eco-African rhetoric could be deeper, but this is one propagandist who isn't afraid to admit how fucked up struggle can get.

The disco disc features identical versions (at 8:06 and 6:04) of the two side-openers--the title track, a magnificent, soul-shouting sisterhood anthem that could set straight cheerleaders and militant lesbians dancing side by side, and ""He's the Greatest Dancer,"" a seductive tribute to a fellow who gets to doff his designer clothes in the presence of countless panting women. (I wonder if I would have been so amused by the boy from New York City in 1965 if I'd known that in 1979 he'd be taken seriously.) All that's missing from the album is ""Lost in Music,"" that one-in-a-hundred I-love-you-know-what song that illuminates its subject. Plus a couple of useless slow ones and some chic riffs. So the d.d. would be your buy--if you could buy it.

Two gentle male alt-whatever thirtysomethings negotiate the tricky shoals of their kindafuckedupness, rapping and cooing to hold their bad nerves at bay, with Son Lux's beats ordering their universe. Serengeti's ""Calm it down"" matches Sufjan's ""I won't be afraid."" But it's Geti's joking around that eases their shared mind.

Skaggs's taste and technique are impeccable; not one of these ten songs, many of them classics I'd never heard before, falters melodically or lyrically, and the arrangements, snazzy though they are, are so steeped in country tradition they could be from decades ago. Which I guess is my beef, because the only way you'd guess it isn't decades ago is from the faint folk-wimp whine in Skaggs's mountain tenor.

If Skaggs has come up with the best country album of the year, as he probably has, it's because despite his abandonment of bluegrass purism he's still a bluegrass purist at heart. Which means his commitment is more to the style than to the songs. Which means that above all his success is proof positive of the pusillanimity of the competition.

Nothing if not an astute traditionalist, Skaggs understands that what makes country music go is the tension between heaven and hell. But where most great country singers come off mealy-mouthed in the virtuous mode, Skaggs makes it sound as if he only sins because he knows he's supposed to. This may mean he's not a great country singer.

Technical brilliance and conceptual integrity put Skaggs on top of Nashville's neotraditionalist totem pole and make his albums run together like bluegrass. But this one has an edge. Maybe it's the moments of calculated grace--blues intro to ""Walkin' in Jerusalem,"" Everlys cover that could break them up all over again, duets with James Taylor and Sharon White. Or maybe it's just the drum sound.

Recorded live in 1983 on a two-track TEAC and God knows what else by a reconstituted bunch of originators, some of whom hadn't seen one another in a decade and wished it was longer, this forty-eight-minutes-a-side retrospective sounds better than the '60s studio rarities Top Deck compiled a few years ago and is a lot of fun to boot. We're talking party soundtrack for lazybones, the universal polka hop-and-shuffle of a thousand folk dances. Bump bottoms to ""Confucius,"" ""Fidel Castro,"" ""Lee Harvey Oswald.""

Fred Frith and Tom Cora's fractured songforms on ""Side Free"" make their seditious point more sharply than I'd feared, but I'm glad I had the sense to play ""Side Dirt"" first--I do prefer songs to song forms.

North Carolinan David Willis is a journeyman beatmaker-producer--big credit: no-big-deal Camp Lo--who's spent the major chunks of his two-decade career in New York. Recently he oversaw two official releases by Young Money second-stringer Curren$y, the kind of thug lite who's admired by Rick Ross's real-fake claque. Those who prefer those albums bemoan the loss here of two Mos Def raps I crashed my search engine seeking out. They're probably good--Mos Def has it all over mos of the nonentities who provide the vocal sounds on this beats-first showcase. Not Jean Grae, though--here's hoping Willis lures her out of her apartment. And note that the Mos Def songs in question, ""Cream of the Planet"" and ""Taxi,"" finish this off on the upswing as sayonora instrumentals. I listen to hip-hop for the rapping. But I've spent a lot of time dwelling on the music here, which combines beats per se with grandiosities like the dramatic intro to ""Nothing but Us,"" the guitar hook of ""Scaling the Building,"" and the full-on movie theme that carries ""Cream of the Planet.""

More or less the nonstop raver you'd expect, only friendlier, offering a much clearer sense of a performer relating to an audience than most concert LPs. Since I've never laid eyes on loud-man Noddy Holder, maybe it's just that I'm untrammeled by preconceptions, or maybe Holder's such a simpleton he's a cinch to suss, or maybe Holder's a genius. But most likely it's a little of all three. Surprise: the (sweet) pop of ""Darling Be Home Soon"" works better than the (automatic) overdrive of ""Born to Be Wild."" Second surprise: just before the final verse, someone approaches the microphone and delivers a very articulate belch.

This includes ""Gudbuy t' Jane"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now,"" the best cuts on Slayed? because it compiles the English hits of these Anglopop phenoms. I take it the reason ""Gudbuy"" and ""Crazee"" are the best cuts on Sladest as well is that these Anglopop phenoms turned into raving maniacs only recently. Clearly, it's what they were meant to be, and although Slayed? is less tuneful, I prefer it. You don't ask an air raid siren to play ""Stardust,"" or even ""Glad All Over.""

Proof that their now superceded farewell, 2007's The Woods, was actually a turning point: great punk band to great rock band. Half the tracks on a placeholder they've long since earned are from The Woods and 2015's No Cities to Love. Tempos are identical, arrangements unchanged; there's not a gift cover or a new song. But live and new, the old punk material does more than hold up--it changes, not exactly for the better but for the firmer. If Carrie is our Joey Ramone, Corin is our Mick Jagger. And you gotta love how Janet dominates the mix. She was always the genius musician here.

On their own label, with Eminem/Fiona Apple adjutant Mike Elizondo overseeing half the album, they shift focus to Alexis Krauss's teenpop roots--""I Can't Stand You Anymore"" has the killer chorus, ""I Can Only Stare"" the balladic gravitas, and both are Elizondo tracks. This is a healthy development with plenty of upside, but it works better in principle than in practice. Krauss may never master pop's heartfelt commitment to putative sincerity, and the one with the killer chorus is also one of the two where Elizondo claims composition as well as production credits. The sincerest is ""Baptism by Fire"" toward the end, where Krauss's ""I want to listen to your heart"" adds a welcome sweetness to the band's raging rhetorical parameters. Elizondo has a writing credit on that one too.

For once a white reggae style that rivals its models for weirdness and formal imagination. The choppy lyrics and playful, quavering, chantlike vocals are a tribute to reggae's inspired amateurism rather than a facsimile, and the spacey rhythms and recording techniques are exploited to solve the great problem of female rock bands, which is how to make yourself heard over all that noise. Arri Up's answer is to sing around it, which is lucky, because she'd be screeching for sure on top of the usual wall of chords. Some of this is thinner and more halting than it's meant to be, but I sure hope they keep it up.

As Nova Scotian as lox and bagels, it's orthodox North American neohip.

A lot of folks just don't like Patti anymore, and so have taken to complaining about the pop melodicism (""AOR sellout"") and shamanistic religiosity (""pretentious phony"") she's always aspired toward. Me, I wish she'd forget she was such a bigshot, and I find ""Seven Ways of Going"" and ""Broken Flag"" as unlistenable as (and less interesting than) ""Radio Ethiopia."" But this is an often inspired album, quirkier than the more generally satisfying Easter--especially on the sexual mystery song ""Dancing Barefoot,"" quite possibly her greatest track ever, and, yes, the reading for the dead pope that she goes out on.

No, she hasn't regained her sense of humor, but aren't you fast losing yours? ""I'm no Sufi but I'll give it a whirl"" makes light enough of the mystic path her political obsessions follow.  And if sometimes her hymns vague out like ""Trespasses"" or over-generalize like ""Jubilee,"" the boho reminisce of ""In My Blakean Year"" represents where she's coming from, the sweet solemnity of ""Gandhi"" and ""Peaceable Kingdom"" sings the sacred, and the amateur-Arabist rant-and-release of ""Radio Baghdad"" speaks poetry to power.

A live version of a revered studio album is de trop. Packaging the two together, so that anyone likely to be interested has to buy a remastered original, is wretched--what Ralph Nader was put on earth to prevent, as both he and Smith tragically forgot. However. The live version is different and in no way worse. It's bigger and fuller yet not more pretentious--more passionate, maybe. Obviously but crucially, it's also older--she's Johnny's mother, consumed by empathy rather than ecstasy. In short, Horses is now a piece of repertoire, subject to two competing interpretations. I'm glad I own both.

Smither comes within a dud original and a few extraneous covers of bring it off, and they're all on side one. Overdisc the two originals are for real and the way he wraps his voice and fingers around ""Maybelline"" and ""Glory of Love"" makes them sound not brand new but old as truth.

After disliking their other albums instantly, I was confused enough by my instant attraction to table this one, especially since I had no stomach for the comparisons I knew an investigation would entail. And indeed, I still can't stand the others. But here Morrissey wears his wit on his sleeve, dishing the queen like Johnny Rotten never did and kissing off a day-job boss who's no Mr. Sellack. This makes it easier to go along on his moonier escapades, like when he reveals that looks and fame don't guarantee a good social life. Which gives you time to notice the tunes, the guitars, the backup munchkins.

Supposedly, Johnny Marr's unobtrusive virtuosity and subtle hooks saved Morrissey from drowning in his own self-involved wit, but on this U.S.-only retrospective of twenty-four previously uncollected songs I hear Marr and Morrissey gliding along on the crest of the same conversational cadence. Morrissey's nattering volubility can get annoying, but the cadence itself always has its charms, and just when you think you've had it he gets off a good line.

For a principled slacker like Snider, diffidence is an aesthetic principle, but here it tends to obscure some affecting little songs.

This woman's languorous, swaying folk-jazz fusion is striking enough to suggest that her debut LP will become some sort of cult item. And it's better than most cult items. But her groove does not quite carry cuts as protracted as ""It Must Be Sunday."" Nor is it an encouraging sign that the most commercial lyric on a verbally distinguished album, ""Poetry Man,"" is also the most fatuous.

Except for ""Mercy on Those,"" a quite remarkably tedious profession of self-righteousness that occupies the last 6:06 of side one, Snow's gifts as a singer and lyricist are finally channeled. The silly mystical ideas are way down below her overriding good sense; up above we find a fairly strong, direct, and happy woman who is by no means vegetating in her contentment, perhaps because she's too insecure ever to become complacent. She's rocking a lot more, correct practice for a content but uncomplacent person, and when her voice wavers it no longer sounds as though it wants to disappear altogether. And the three non-originals--""Teach Me Tonight,"" ""Don't Let Me Down,"" and ""Shakey Ground""--make quite a combo.

But punch a few buttons and you get a 10- or 12-track tribute to great divas male and female.

But Soriano's guitar is so nimble and articulate you forgive him his pleasantries, and on his second U.S. album his sisters add sweet and spicy accents to his beseeching vocals, which may deliver the Spanish lyrics but seldom leap any language barriers.

Of griot family, the seminal Senegambian salsero sang forcefully from the sternum and grooved unshakably from the fundament, a principled disciple-evangelist who recorded regularly with Orquesta Aragon in Paris and occasionally with his Manhattan heroes as well. In Dakar he was the dancing master of the postcolonial elite, steadying his bands' Congo-rooted ""Latin"" beats so that they signified for West Africans. In what I assume is completist grandeur on a two-CD set whose fran?ais-seulement notes are impeccably free of useful detail, these 26 ('70s?) ('80s?) (classic?) (early?) tracks are solid and resonant once the recording quality rights itself. Seldom, however, do they rise above, with the biggest exception the same ""Marie Gomis"" available in somewhat duller audio on the Sosseh album I've puzzled longest over, Monguito El Unico and Laba Sosseh. Three of the other four tracks on that record also repeat here, with the bonus that this ""Yamanekh"" adds a speedy and welcome three-minute coda. A titan, definitely, and near as I can tell--compared to Sar's easier-to-find Laba Sosseh, for instance--this is as good as you're liable to find until some saint does a proper comp.

FALSE,B+,While You Were Out,Soul Asylum,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8411,"
Dave Pirner's songs and Chris Osgood's sound do focus their barrage-band intensity, but once again the most striking track is a slow country-folk rip, this one cribbed more or less direct from ""On Top of Old Smokey."" Which isn't to put down Pirner's better-than-average tunes, but to suggest that barrage meanings may not be his calling.
"
FALSE,B+,Let Your Dim Light Shine,Soul Asylum,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3236,"
Welcome evidence that Dave Pirner may not be the Bob Seger of his generation--because where in the late '70s temptation came in the form of classic rock, in the mid-'90s it lies along pop's primrose path, a development that should offend only grunge nostalgiacs. The tunes of these neatly crafted songs are up top, their ""roots"" submerged the way roots usually are. And the often funny, sometimes fantastic lyrics are so smart you'd almost think Pirner knows how cheap he got away last time. After lingering over idioms like ""don't get my hopes up"" and ""left to my own devices,"" he moves on to vignettes in which his pervasive depression connects to something less collegiate than existential angst--the hard, sad lives of other people, several of them women seen not as objects of sex or romance, just struggling humans like him and me.

FALSE,B+,"To Syria, With Love",Omar Souleyman,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17211,"
In a way it's simple and in a way it's anything but. The simple part is that if you like rhythmically intense music that's spare and huge and human-scale all at once, you have to hear this intransigently masculine Syrian exile: call-and-response between his imploring baritone and oud lines adapted to baritone synth (over percussion aplenty, you bet). If you're impressed, as you will be, buy an album, why not? Moreover, you might as well start with this one, which has Diplo's label behind it the way 2013's Wenu Wenu had Kieran Hebden's. The not-simple part comes if you've already got your Souleyman album--Wenu Wenu itself, or the live Haflat Garbia, say. This one's more . . . I don't know, these differentiations are so marginal, focused or measured. Also, the Arabic lyrics you'll need a booklet to parse yearn on two occasions for his lost homeland rather than some metaphorical woman. But if you already own two of his albums, I doubt you need a third.

The vapidity of ""A happy face, a thumping bass, for a loving race"" wouldn't bother anybody if these Londoners didn't take dread in vain--with hair like that you're supposed to be more, you know, cultural. But for a disco band, they're quite all right, really--very tuneful, with a nice loping groove and vocals out of Chic and Eddy Grant. And though I wish they liked saxophones, the flute is them.

Anglophilia's favorite androids were destined from day of manufacture to meet up with some rock technocrat or other, so thank Ford it was Giorgio Moroder, the most playful of the breed. They even got a minor dance hit out of it--""Beat the Clock,"" a good one--but that's not the point. The point is channeling all their evil genius--well, evil talent, then--into magic tricks. Like the ultimate voice-box song. Or the title tune, which sounds like ""Baba O'Riley"" and then breaks down into Eno (or is that Gentle Giant?). Fun fun fun.

But she's sure put some benwa balls into a slut act only wankers took literally, and now the balls have beats. From ""Gimme More""'s ""It's Britney bitch"" hiya to ""Piece of Me""'s single-of-the-year sonics, from ""Ooh Ooh Baby""'s ""feel you deep inside"" to ""Perfect Lover""'s ""touch me there,"" this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked.

Moreover, it's possible the stupidity of the sex symbol up front is an illusion exploited by her legal guardians and maybe even the symbol herself. But it's such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy. She's just too straight-faced with the botched Bellamy Brothers joke, the nauseous ""Your body look so sick I think I got the flu,"" the abstemious ""Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,"" the concupiscent ""I'm a little selfish"" become the childish ""I'm a little sailfish.""

There's miraculous rhythmic progress from the polkafied chug-along of the Specials' ska to the suave Caribbean lilt here, which makes Jerry Dammers's most reclusive flights functional. But Dammers (together with mouthpiece Stan Campbell) never convinces me that the anomie he evokes so stubbornly has the public dimension that its proximity to ""Bright Lights,"" ""Racist Friend,"" and ""Free Nelson Mandela"" implies.

I don't often wonder what the world is coming to because someone can't get a record contract--after all, life is unfair--but here I'm tempted. A sharp, witty bar-band-blues LP like the first is one thing, but the mid-tempo stuff on this entry could fit in right next to Tom Petty and Bob Seger if only some hotshot producer would oil Robert Bobby's voice up a little. That's no advantage as far as I'm concerned, but uncommercial it ain't. What could be the problem? Surely not the antinuke overtones of ""Hearts Like Atoms Split."" Maybe somebody noticed the chorus of ""Anna"": ""Anna, anabolic steroid/Oh Anna, you made a man outta me.""

FALSE,B+,What We Saw From the Cheap Seats,Regina Spektor,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15729,"
Outside of country music (and I don't know who compares there), pop music is home to few friendlier artists than Regina Spektor. So well-meaning you want to kiss the tip of her nose, she uses her classical chops to craft tunes that will help any normal listener smile. But although a practical humanist is a rare thing, this one often needs more spice or even grit, and here her whimsy is front and center. I love ""All the Rowboats,"" about a museum--""Masterpieces serving maximum sentences/It's their own fault/For being timeless""--and ""Firewood,"" about a piano. ""Ballad of a Politician"" plays off ""Shake it, shake it baby"" (hands, get it?) and ""Open"" comes with a gurgling groan. But many of these songs are merely bemused, and when she revises ""I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,"" all she achieves is a different singalong from the one you expected.

You're a fan of the Spinners' first tenor, Felipe Wind (sp?), whose vocal improvisations, as free as Al Green's though in more of a jazz scat mode, play against the Spinners' disciplined harmonies in a virtuoso demonstration of the limits of slick.

The notes identify them as ""pioneers"" of ""topical lyrics that were realized by the production of the song,"" which makes me think again about the way the first two cuts, ""1984"" and ""Mechanical World,"" shift texture and tempo. By the stars, I do believe these fellows helped invent art-rock. This is not an unmixed distinction, but it could be worse: the topicality is a notch above ordinary rock sci-fi (they have a sense of humor), the derivations more jazz than classical. The big plus here though, is that great shining 2:39 of hard rock guitar, Randy California's ""I Got a Line on You.""

Avatars of a slightly slowed-down Belgian industrial-disco style (subculture?) that I suspect is called ""new beat"" because buyers will know what the phrase means anywhere in the EEC, they don't overdo the wimp and doom factors that ruin so much synth-based dance music--just play them for tune and discord respectively. A taste for sex and the occasional funny bit facilitate this achievement.

A few songs grab you, the rest grow on you, the lyric sheet makes some sense. Dynamics fill in for groove. But even after you run the hooks through your head for a day--""Take the fifth,"" ""fitted shirt,"" ""that you're next to me""--you don't have much idea what Britt Daniel is on about, except maybe that he wonders why he works so hard on his songs, and (duh) has yet to find true love. And beyond ""Take the fifth,"" no phrases stick out as free-floating signifiers, either. In short, the indie-pop conundrum in a nutshell too slippery to crack--unless you really like filberts.

Britt Daniel's voice is so unyieldingly masculine it could make you miss the soulful self-pity of a Gavin Rossdale. So what keeps me playing his long-delayed return to the majors is the sound effects. Hums and handclaps and whistling. Vibraphone gurgle and harp arpeggio and Fairlight fanfare. Drum rolls and digital clickety-clacks. Piano plinking, piano freaking, organ swells, keyb distorts. Guitar colors of every description--pseudo uke! fingering squelch! neck strum! There's a falsetto moment. There's a duet vocal. You too can be glued to your chair waiting for the next surprise like it's a hidden joke on a Fountains of Wayne album. Start with ""Knock Knock Knock,"" which is jammed with them. Or if you prefer, just light up and spend 40 minutes giggling when you least expect it.

Fledgling producer David Wolfert doesn't get her voice as subtly as Roy Thomas Baker (or Jerry Wexler) did, but he gives her more good songs than she's had in a decade.

I find it hard to be objective about the woman who in 1969 joined Jerry Wexler to make one of my favorite--hell, one of the greatest albums of all time: Dusty in Memphis, pop with strings on top, good old boys below, and the most exquisite material of a class act's career in between. Springfield's only rival was and is Dionne Warwick, but Warwick has Bacharach-David in her karass while Dust was stuck with Ivor Raymonde. This mid-60's hits compilation could be a lot better: it predates the definitive ""The Look of Love"" and bypasses inspired filler like ""Mama Said"" and ""Do Re Mi"" for the hideously orchestrated schlock she spent her biggest years transcending. Yet though she never belted like she crooned, she put so much heart, soul, and mind into her big ballads that most of the time you can ignore the kettle drums. I only wish I could hear what Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin--and Dusty--would have made of ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me.""

""The Angel"" and ""Mary Queen of Arkansas"" are turgid unaccompanied-acoustic horrors that could scare anybody off this particular Dylan hype. But the jokey lingo and absurdist energy of everything else are exactly the excesses that made Dylan a genius instead of a talent--it takes real conviction to save ""But did not heed my urgency"" with ""Your life was one long emergency."" Even urban-mythos rambles like ""Lost in the Flood"" are not without charm. And in songs like ""Growin' Up"" and ""Blinded by the Light"" there's an unguarded teen-underclass poetry that has Springsteen's name on it.

""Promised Land,"" ""Badlands,"" and ""Adam Raised a Cain"" are models of how an unsophisticated genre can illuminate a mature, full-bodied philosophical insight. Lyrically and vocally, they move from casual to incantatory modes with breathtaking subtlety, jolting ordinary details into meaning. But many of the other songs remain local-color pieces, and at least two--""Something in the Night"" and ""Streets of Fire""--are overwrought, soggy, all but unlistenable. An important minor artist or a rather flawed and inconsistent major one.

The title and no doubt the intermittently ""commercial"" sound are about band democracy, or maybe dictatorship of the proletariat--Stampfel gives up three lead vocals and five songs and gets the most uneven record of a career that's never confused consistency with virtue. The division is almost too neat--only one Stampfel loser, and also only one non-Stampfel winner, the John-Lee-Hooker ad absurdum ""Mindless Boogie,"" which together with Stampfel's democratically romantic ""Bridge and Tunnel Girls"" may actually earn the college-novelty rotation he's always deserved.

Staples's argument is, first, that the thug life was forced on him, not merely because he grew up on the wrong side of Long Beach but because his parents were gangbangers, and second, that white America is invested in the thug life, via not just the systemic racism that keeps African-Americans down but the systemic sensationalism of white hip-hop fans scarfing up gangsta horrorshow. As a white hip-hop fan who's resisted every thug coup d'art since the Wu-Tang Clan (who were major, I was wrong, but I hate guns and I hate sexism and I'd rather be wrong than tag along), I believe the sensationalism is more ironic than causal except perhaps insofar as gangsta swagger impresses boys in the hood who might otherwise settle for the crap jobs staying in school is good for. But give Staples credit--he doesn't swagger. He's always hard, often impassive, occasionally callous, but never brutal or mean, and nothing in his rhymes, flow, or beats boasts or romanticizes. What good that'll do who knows. But he's not part of any problem I can see. As thug coups d'art go, this takes Rick Ross to court, renders Freddie Gibbs more unnecessary than he already is, and is hella cooler than Iceberg Slim.

For no discernible reason--when last seen (on Broadway), they appeared ready to settle for Winnemucca if Vegas didn't call--this is their toughest and best Stax LP. Once again the prime virtue is consistency, but this time they add a few lumens to the average brightness of each performance. And though their social vision may be vague, at least they were political before it was commercial, which gives them an edge. Best cut: ""My Main Man,"" about Jesus.

Mike Piccirillo and Gary Goetzman, who brainstormed not only the Heads cover that brought the Staples back last year but also the bedroom-eyes embarrassment that was supposed to cement their chart status, here discover that the great pop subject of this reformed gospel group is public morality. And lead off with two covers--the first from, are you ready, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, topped by ""Life During Wartime""--so incandescent they lend a glow to the producer-penned protest sentiments that follow.

David Hinds has always signed his music by swinging the beat a little more than is normally advisable, and this time, subtly but tellingly, his jazzbo tendencies catch up with him. Where in the past he'd add a subliminal tension to the groove by extending syllables slightly, here his phrasing sometimes goes slack--at one point he even adds a ""now"" that would do Joe Piscopo proud to the line ""As long as Babylon is my foe."" So despite strong material, this lacks the requisite steely edge. And whether the confusion of ""laboratory"" with ""lavatory"" is simple ignorance or one of those deep Rasta puns, it sums up his wit and wisdom on ""these times of science and technology"" all too neatly.

After all, to a certain kind of reclusive aesthete, well-crafted West Coast studio jazz is as beautiful as anything else, right? Only I'm no recluse. I hated this record for quite a while before I realized that, unlike The Royal Scam, it was stretching me some; I still find the solo licks of Larry Carlton, Victor Feldman, et al. too fucking tasty, but at least in this context they mean something. I'm also grateful to find Fagen and Becker's collegiate cynicism in decline; not only is ""Deacon Blues"" one of their strongest songs ever, it's also one of their warmest. Now if only they'd rhymed ""I cried when I wrote this song"" with ""Sue me if I play it wrong,"" instead of ""Sue me if I play too long."" Prefering long to wrong could turn into their fatal flaw.

An excellent comeback from two bad albums, marred only by the lyrics. John Kay's lyrics have always been awkward and preachy, in a fairly endearing way, but he had the sense to keep them fuzzed behind, so that they had to be discovered.

Problem is the mere competence that afflicts so many well-meaning bands: it's versatile of them to generate as well as sample beats, but ""A.F.R.I.C.A."" went nowhere musically, and Wise's smart talk is buried in a ""Float On"" remake even ickier than the original. Album two gets across not on ace cuts like the revolutionary credo ""Freedom or Death"" (Professor Griff please copy) or the sampling credo ""Talking All That Jazz"" (James Brown please copy), but on a camaraderie that reaches deeper than the usual homeboy bonding. How much further it can go remains to be seen.

A landmark: the first rock record to use the word ""fuck"" (""fucking,"" actually) at the end of a line, an achievement typical of its occasional flaws--the rhyming word, ""plucking,"" is forced--and unrepresentative of its success. The eighteen-minute title cut is a decent, serious, and touching reminiscence of sexual growth that for all its male bias is recommended to songwriters reluctant to shed their adolescence. The other songs are well-observed despite their sentimental tendencies, and guest guitarist Jimmy Page proves that folk-rock is his metier.

Well past his moment at 32, he died on the road in 1970, leaving this, more or less: two doowop-derived soul-r&amp;b sob-song classics, trilled and scatted pull-out-the-stops demolitions of Doris Day's ""Secret Love"" and the Gershwins' ""Summertime,"" and other vehicles for his piercing tenor and sharp groove--notably ""Fat Boy,"" about an overweight lover who may be built for comfort but is also, for once, insecure. In short, a more distinguished body of minor music than can be claimed by many better-remembered later soul men who'll remain nameless here.

FALSE,B+,You're Not the Woman You Used to Be,Gary Stewart,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1345,"
In case it's not clear why rock and rollers are so excited about a new country singer, it's because he really sings rockabilly, which supposedly flourished for a few years in the mid-'50s and then vanished. What I like best about this compilation of flop singles from a few years ago is the way Stewart transforms rockabilly's adolescent phobias about wimmin into unabashed burlesques involving the likes of ""Big Bertha"" and ""The Snuff Queen.""

FALSE,B+,Battleground,Gary Stewart,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1351,"
As with so many country albums, one's faith fluctuates from listen to listen: the songwriting isn't always absolutely choice, at times the voice lurches back toward the gulps and hollers that swamped his attempted comeback, and his guilt sounds more emotionally whole than his rowdy ways, which is why he's always been a country singer with r&amp;r affinities rather than vice versa. But this is his best in 13 years (just lucky, I guess). His r&amp;r groove is sharp-witted where Steve Earle's is muscle-headed and the average Nashville cat's just mechanical. And whether he's pledging desperate devotion or spitting out the perfect pun-trope ""Seeing's believing/So I'll be leaving today,"" you know damn well it's his fault. Whatever it is.

After Smiler I was convinced that his talent had vanished; this makes it seem that he'll be breathing life into ten songs a year in perpetuity. The Southern session men he works with here suit his more generalized interpretive approach, on the ""slow side"" as well as the ""fast.""

FALSE,B+,The Best of Rod Stewart,Rod Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7891,"
As if to prove how arbitrary compilation albums from consistent album artists are, this omits four selections from Sing It Again Rod. The third side, which features both halves of a previously uncollected single and the previously unavailable-on-disc ""What Made Milwaukee Famous,"" has its uses. And the stuff from Smiler should never have come out in the first place.

Cut for cut this is Stewart's most consistent Warners album, and it does rescue three tracks from Foot Loose and Fancy Free. But its malfeasances are so annoying--there are already three (Mercury) albums that include the anachronistic ""Maggie May,"" and it would be nice to have the disco mix of ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" on an LP--that maybe you should seek out Atlantic Crossing. ""Tonight's the Night"" you know to death, right? But when's the last time you heard his ""Three Time Loser"" or ""This Old Heart of Mine""?

This group tests our male-timbre chauvinism--Ian Lloyd sounds disconcertingly like a goil. Too bad he voices the same old male sentiments--don't let me down, push me 'round, or complain when I leave at the dawning--because the music is special: dense, clean, kinetic, almost mid-Beatles in spirit, but contemporary. If only they'd written one lyric as breathtaking as most of Michael Brown's melodies or as strong and as flexible as Lloyd's voice turns out to be or as commercial-meaningful as their hit remake of Hot Chocolate's ""Brother Louie.""

This isn't so much hard country as quiet honky tonk, which I don't hold against Strait, a handsome and discerning fellow whose pleasant baritone, though not designed to swallow whole cans of corn (cf. John Anderson, Ricky Skaggs), boasts a subtle, built-in catch. But he's so unassuming I'm afraid he's destined to remain a minor pleasure--one more lonely tiller in fields left fallow by Billy Sherrill.

As an unreconstructed rock-and-roller, I prefer my country music out on the edge--if not zany or wild-ass then at least (and often as best: Jones, Frizzell, Wynette) deeply soulful. Despite his regard for the zany, wild-ass, and deeply soulful verities, what I get from Strait is a convincing show of honesty. And what I get from his best album and song selection to date is a convincing, tuneful show of honesty.

Timely details--cellphone cutouts and charging problems, TV sex tips. Eternal truths--he's sure she's done bad stuff, but in the heat of argument can't remember just when. Dodgy plotting--obscure bit with Simone's coat leads to sad ending with a twist. A hook marks each chapter--right, chapter. This makes engrossing listening if the effort suits you, but it's useless as background music--behind Alan Sillitoe, Roddy Doyle, Dick Hebdige, the box scores, anything.

FALSE,B+,Full Time Woman,Alice Stuart,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7919,"
Beautiful melodies and clean, countryish, somewhat static postfolk arrangements transform these lyrics into memorable statements of feeling and principle. A bit male-identified, I admit, but the salutory synthesis of small voice and independent spirit proves that a woman doesn't have to be macho to be autonomous. Now who'll prove it for men?

One reason Paul Weller's rock and roll never convinced non-Brits was his reedy voice, which he has no trouble bending to the needs of the fussy phonographic cabaret he undertook so quixotically and affectedly after retiring the Jam. I'm sure the move has cost him audience, but the new format suits the specifics of his socialism. A self-made Fabian rather than a would-be demagogue, he hopes to inspire militance with description and analysis. My Ever Changing Moods was so moody it flirted with incoherence, but here the politics are concealed on the surface of a fluent if not seamless Europop that goes down easy.

James Taylor is merely a wimp--Russell Thompkins, Jr. is a Wimp God. The creamy fluidity of his falsetto is miraculous, and the settings provided by composer-producer Thom Bell simply heavenly. Unfortunately, the material isn't as consistent on the group's second album in a year (three hits plus uneven filler) as on the first (five hits plus impressive filler).

Skinflints and formalists both, indie guys resist the digital bloat that sends most releases ballooning toward an hour, and I say good for them. The three otherwise unreleased tracks on this EP would have fit physically onto the new album but undercut it conceptually, and all the worse if few listeners would have noticed. More powerful than Beaster, less revealing than Copper Blue, this is Mould Inc. in ""dark"" mode. Fans will be content to pay extra for it. Admirers won't suffer if they pass it by.

They're as quirky as you thought they were, but no longer are their quirks strictly personal, which may help their disjointed musical effects impact on the rest of us. Bj������������������rk's Freudian fantasies are subsumed in a not unfantastic adult sexuality, and she shares more of the stage with Einar, who plays madness to her empathic concern even when she's abandoning him to the encroaching ice. The end of the world interests them now that they've got a place in it: they face or face down their doom with a humor and affection that's sometimes fatalistic but never passive. In short, they're beginning to sound like a band with at least as much future as the rest of"

In which schlocky Michael Omartian replaces magic man Quincy Jones and Summer is born again. You know why? Because Omartian believes in Jesus, that's why. The result is the best Christian rock this side of T-Bone Burnett, and not just because it's suitable for Danceteria, although that helps. After all, can T-Bone claim to have introduced the concept of agape to the secular audience?

FALSE,B+,Another Place and Time,Donna Summer,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6127,"
I tried to credit her comebacks, giving up only when that song about fucking Einstein cracked WBLS. But though Stock Aitken Waterman are no Einsteins, they're smart enough to know a voice when they hear one, which usually happens when they listen to other people's records--they've invented a pop machine that enables singers as adenoidal as the average British teenager to pass for Motown Mark XC after one or two treatments. Since Summer's great gift has always been her ability to emote inconsistent banalities as if her life depended on them, which after all those failed comebacks it kind of does, she lights into these retooled tunes with a phony enthusiasm that must have scared the shit out of Bananarama. Ever up, ever danceable, ever there, she's once again a believer, or rather ""believer."" And hidden over on the second side is a succinct new cliche about why women leave their men.

A/k/a Cornelius Green of Opelousas, Louisiana, Sundown came out of a decade's retirement to cut this modest but exemplary blues LP.

Mark Kozelek has always been one more alt-rock sad sack to me, and without much a beat at that, so I won't pretend there's any musical reason to listen to this wall-to-wall bummer. But where he's generally obsessed on an alt-rock melancholy about which most human beings could care less, here he explores something that happens to everyone: death in the family, mostly in working-class Ohio, where he grew up. There's his second cousin Carissa gone at 35 in a freak garbage fire, his uncle gone the same way long ago, his kindly grandma in L.A., and worst of all his dad's pseudonymous mercy-killing friend--who with his wife taken out of her misery turned the gun on himself only then ""failed at suicide"" and got sentenced to prison. All of which induces him to write ""I Love My Dad"" and ""I Can't Live Without My Mother's Love,"" and whether you're attracted to his songs or not you feel just how bad this depressive is gonna hurt when his long-separated parents go. That's musical enough for me.

For the most part this miracle of homogeneity bounces along in the background, occasionally brightening the room with a riff or a harmony or a phrase or a touch of electricity that betokens writer-producer Smokey Robinson expressing himself. ""Your Wonderful Sweet Sweet Love"" and ""Floy Joy"" and ""Automatically Sunshine"" aren't prime Smokey. But they're choice, meriting my most generous Muzak rating.

Winner of a Sony talent contest at 19, he uses amateur technology to define a private dreamworld rather than a public space, and he cracked black radio almost instantly, going pop with the DIY cockiness of his rapper homeboys. This is electronic cocktail soul as thrill-a-minute mood music, and as usual the secret is rhythm--playful riffs and echoes and synthetic percussion setting off a hopelessly slight, totally supple voice.

FALSE,B+,I Can Help,Billy Swan,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7941,"
As befits an unknown one-shot who names his album after his big single--especially a single that advances the rockabilly moment eighteen years--Swan has made an LP with a B side. Only it's one of those B sides thrown together so casually that you find yourself attracted by its elan. Programmed with ""I Can Help"" are four listenable examples of Swan's detached singing style, all separated from nostalgia by wacky absurdist touches. But on side two the absurdism is provided solely by Swan's willingness to waver perversely off pitch on otherwise straightforward tunes from Elvis Presley, Charlie Rich, and C. Boone, whoever he is. It's only a sloppy quickie, but I like it.

Any rockabilly who sings ""I'm still me and you're still you"" as if he's boasting, or trying to, knows the intense nervousness of good old macho in a way Carl Perkins only had nightmares about. Which is why this record is as good as it is, and also why it isn't any better.

Chagrined with Billy's tendency to cope with maturity by hitting himself over the head with violins, I almost didn't give this a chance, which would have been a shame--it's simple and gentle and steadfastly tuneful, mostly domestic with a few winsome courtship songs to prove he's a Nashville pro. Theme: ""Not Far From 40."" Still loves rock and roll, he says, and I know just what he means.

With percussion techniques borrowed from the scrap industry and a guitar bottom that lows like mechanical cattle and howls like the wind in a zombie movie, this is no wave with five years of practice, too messy for mysticism and too funny for suicide. In the great tradition of their live sets, it gets wearing, and lyrics are available to suckers on request. Not only isn't it for everybody, it isn't for hardly nobody. I think it's a hoot.

FALSE,B+,"The House of Friendly Ghosts, Vol. 1: Featuring Khaira Arby",The Sway Machinery,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15516,"
This strange record would mean less without the bound booklet written by guitarist-vocalist, cantor's grandson, and transcultural seeker Jeremiah Lockwood. And it would mean rather less than that without the three songs by Saharan diva Khaira Arby, whose own Timbuktu Tarab is more consistent but less gripping. The band comprises Lockwood, a drummer, and three horn players who add major oomph to Arby's stately, impassioned showcases. Camels grunt, children trill, women chant. And then there's Lockwood, a deeply pretentious guy who sometimes puts his transculturalism over, but don't count on it. Thank Allah that Arby contributes some backup vocals as well. Thank Jahweh too, I suppose.

Side one is pure pop for then people, eight pieces of punchy Chapman-Chinn bubblegum from the mid-'70s glam band whose cross between T. Rex and Slade made the competition look both authentic and inefficient. Songs like ""Poppa Joe"" and ""Wig Wam Bam"" will take on the spiritual resonance of ""Chewy Chewy"" only if you happened to reside in Britain when they were dominating the airwaves, but give them a few spins and they'll push your fun button. Side two is more problematic, summing up as it does the period after they parted with Chapman-Chinn to write their own songs and earn their own royalties, or so they thought.

Frustrated because I couldn't grok Bluroraimeemann even after isolating their tunes and turns of phrase, I turned to another pop album I'd never gotten and had a revelation. Not a new idea--what a difference a band makes is old theory by now. Just an experience--this particular band at the moment of this recording, two or three or four guitars layered into densely striated sludge with shiny ribbons of metal sticking out. Perfect for accustoming confused young adults to his sensible truisms about romantic commitment.

FALSE,B+,Fool Around,Rachel Sweet,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2854,"
Two compositions by (ousted?) svengali Liam Sternberg have been replaced on the U.S. release by prime, straightforward rockers. This makes sense. Like Tanya Tucker, Sweet thrives on simple material, and while I like Sternberg's catchy, thoughtful songs, their fussy, uncolloquial moments don't suit Sweet's hot-teen persona: Deborah Harry might sound charmingly klutzy on the rhythmically overwrought ""Cuckoo Clock"" or ""Suspended Animation"" (""I could wait for any duration""), but Sweet just sounds like she's following instructions. Unfortunately, both these songs were left on the LP, while natural Sweet stuff like ""Just My Style"" and ""Truckstop Queen"" (on Stiff's Akron anthology) were omitted. This doesn't make sense.

When Harvey Fuqua brought Sylvester back to the vinyl wars last year, he was seeking a disco hit. Well, eureka--""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"" is a real mutha for ya, one of those surges of sustained, stylized energy that is disco's great gift to pop music. In fact, the whole first side is classic dance montage. Side two proves that Sylvester remains incapable of impersonating Cissy Houston or Eddie Kendricks, though he's getting closer, and n.b.: on the most convincing cut he strays down into his speaking voice.

In which Mr. S. stretches his two best tricks--for thrills, a supernal burst of sound too sweet for a shriek that he unlooses well above his normal falsetto range; for romance, a transported croon--over a consistently satisfying four-cut disco album, with help from his own Martha Wash and the Labelle-without-camp of Hodges, James and Smith. The title track tinges Sly Stone with Andy Warhol, but the tour de force is a remake of Ben E. King's ""I (Who Have Nothing),"" and you know what? Its artificiality suits the schlocky lyric at least as well as King's virtuoso dramatics.

Funk's answer to the Thompson Twins conflate the organic and the electronic more blatantly than Prince.

Nick Lowe Title Pun Trophy: ""You Are in My System.""

FALSE,B+,Melting Pot,Booker T. & the MG's,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7955,"
Here the Memphis motorvators surpass the somewhat boxy rhythms that have limited all their albums as albums except for Uptight, which had vocals. Al Jackson's solidity, a linchpin of rock drumming as surely as Keith Moon's blastoffs and Charlie Watts's steady economy, is unshaken by the shifts the arrangements demand, and his deftness permits a more flexible concept in which Booker lays back some on organ and Steve Cropper gets more melodic input. A Vegas-jazz (""L.A. Jazz Song"" is a title) boop-de-doo chorus upsets the balance of side two pretty badly, but for the first twenty minutes this is unbelievably smooth without ever turning slick.

Always skeptical of live albums, I note that this is their second in a four-year period that has netted only one studio job while establishing them as a world-class live band. Number one was a useful overview; number two is a soundtrack, albeit for the finest concert film I've ever seen, that repeats three songs from the overview and four from the studio job.

Where Paul Simon appropriated African musicians, David Byrne just hires them, for better and worse--this is T. Heads funk heavy on the horns, which aren't fussy or obtrusive because Byrne knew where to get fresh ones. What's African about it from an American perspective is that the words don't matter--it signifies sonically. The big exception is the glorious ""(Nothing But) Flowers,"" a gibe at ecology fetishism that's very reassuring in this context.

FALSE,B+,Ain't It Something,James Talley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1655,"
The country populism on Talley's previous album was vague enough to suit Johnny Cash or Charley Pride (not to mention Jimmy Carter) and went with mawkish love songs and some dubious B.B. King guitar. This one is as tough culturally/politically as Tryin' Like the Devil, as tender romantically/domestically as Got No Bread, and puts in some James Brown funk where it belongs.

Led, not to say dominated, by an impressive twentysomething singer-songwriter-guitarist named Ousmane ag Massa, this Tuareg guitar group came together at a Western-funded private school designed to protect the desert people from a Malian educational system that's stacked against them. They're vocal about their debt to Tinariwen, founders and leaders of their musical/political movement, but from the opening riff of their 2010 debut they don't favor Tinariwen's austerity. ""He watches a world in movement evolving beyond him,"" that song translates, and they want better than to watch. Quite often you can hear how much.

It's so simple even arrant schlockmeisters like Lambert and Potter can pull it off. You'll need a dynamite single to set the mood, of course, but if you're patient and work hard there'll be an ""It Only Takes a Minute"" every year or two. Make sure a couple of the other entries from your songwriting mill are of top quality (""Ready, Willing and Able,"" ""In the City"") and then--this is important--fill holes with outside material (Edgar Winter, George Clinton, AWB) for variety. So how come no other disco-oriented vocal group has produced a satisfying album this year? Might as well ask why money is green.

FALSE,B+,Genuine Houserocking Music,Hound Dog Taylor and the Houserockers,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8474,"
The HouseRockers were the Ramones of Chicago blues, cutting three wonderful, virtually indistinguishable albums before Taylor left this self-composed epitaph in 1975: ""He couldn't play shit, but he sure made it sound good!"" His secrets were cheap equipment, a slide fashioned from the leg of a kitchen table, and the most enthusiastic reliance on ""Dust My Broom"" since Elmore James. It's completely fitting that this all-new album should be almost as fine as the two that came out of the twenty-cuts-a-night 1971 and 1973 sessions from which it's culled, yet somehow reassuring that it doesn't quite match up. Taylor slurs too much, quite a claim in this context, and ""What'd I Say"" and ""Kansas City"" are bar-band throwaways, by which I mean that George Thorogood, Taylor's chief epigone, could do them better.

FALSE,B+,Koko Taylor,Koko Taylor,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7975,"
Taylor sounds like you always wanted those women with Big in front of their names to sound--powerful, even rough, without ever altogether abandoning her rather feminine register. But though mentor Willie Dixon is the greatest contemporary blues composer, he's no more reliable album to album than any other song factory--the best lyric here, ""Love You Like a Woman"" (""But I'll also fight you like a man""), isn't his. Terrific production, though--his soul devices are so crude and obvious they're funny, amazing, or at least odd.
"
FALSE,B+,I Got What It Takes,Koko Taylor,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1949,"
Taylor's first album in three years illustrates the difference between blues as (theoretical) pop music on Chess and blues as (theoretical) art music on Alligator. There's a certain hothouse quality to this album--it's devoid of endearing, enriching commercial vulgarities. But both band (featuring Mighty Joe Young and Sammy Lawhorn on guitar and the endearing Abb Locke on saxophone) and material (from Taylor and Dixon through Elmore James and Magic Sam and Ruth Brown to Otis Spann's unnecessarily theoretical ""Blues Never Die"") range beyond Chess's commercial strictures, which more than makes up.
"
FALSE,B+,The Earthshaker,Koko Taylor,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7977,"
Considering its size, Taylor's voice has never been what you'd call rich--she flubs the pitch quite a bit, and on the slow ones she's often sounded flat emotionally as well. But it retains amazing presence--by now it's deepened and roughened so much that her late work for Chess sounds girlish by comparison. Two or three of the slow ones here really drag, always a crippling flaw in Chicago blues, but the uptempo stuff is exemplary--the songs are fun as songs, and the guitar on her latest remake of ""Wang Dang Doodle"" is ace.
"
FALSE,B+,Queen of the Blues,Koko Taylor,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8475,"
This is definitive only in the sense that any good Chicago blues album is. But she does sink her chops into some exceptionally well-conceived songs on the A, and on the B she's got Albert Collins, Son Seals, and Lonnie Brooks sprucing things up guitarwise. Also, not a slow one anywhere.

Title tune's the only time they've yoked melody/noise/sound and sense/nonsense/paradox at optimum archness without undercutting either or both. The other one with words comes close. The two instrumentals only partly fulfill their modest mission in life, which is fusing strum and skronk.
"
FALSE,B+,The Blow Up,Television,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8478,"
John Piccarella and I annotated this eighty-five-minute tape because guitar heroes like Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd deserve a heroic live album. While the more word-heavy songs worked better in the studio, on the likes of ""Foxhole,"" ""Prove It,"" and ""Marquee Moon,"" ahem, ""Verlaine takes off in directions that even he probably didn't anticipate, indulging a lyrical wanderlust he never permitted himself when he had time to think about it. And Lloyd, always constrained by the necessity of getting his solos and rhythm riffs just right in the studio, goes nuts here--what he wanted to express on `Satisfaction' was so beyond his chops that he would regularly unwind his bottom E string, twist it behind the neck, and tense the guitar like an archer's bow, producing the unearthly noises preserved for posterity on this cassette."" You also get two other key covers and a definitive ""Little Johnny Jewel."" But the sound could have been brighter--cf. Arrow, the bootleg disc where I first encountered the finest of these performances. And so, as with so many ROIR cassettes (and commercial tapes in general), audio makes the difference between a laudable document and living history.

FALSE,B+,Television,Television,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3435,"
I prefer the more rocking, songful old Television, but it's a tribute to Tom Verlaine's conceptual restlessness and force of personality that in a world where alternative guitar means making noise or mixing and matching from the used bins, these four veterans have regrouped with a distinct new sonic identity. Droll, warm-hearted, sophisticated, cryptic, jazzy yet unjazzlike, they sound like nothing else--except, just a little, old Television, mainly because Verlaine has ignored the Lloyd Cole jokes and refused to alter his voiceprint.

The producer gets one side--live ""funky music,"" a song about white people that's actually nasty, and the Franz Mesmer Memorial Version of ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone,"" all 11:45 of it. The group gets the other--sweet ballads of varying quality plus three minutes of easy Isaac Hayes funk. The album is their best of the decade--mostly on the strength of the producer's side.

Separating the jokes from the japes, eschewing atmospheric preciosity, and climaxing with two great pieces of lovesong schmaltz that define the group's seriousness, this is as consistent a 10cc LP as you can buy. But I miss oldies like ""Johnny, Don't Do It,"" ""The Worst Band in the World,"" ""Oh Effendi."" And I still don't believe ""Dreadlock Holiday"" is ""Safe European Home"" in corporate-rock drag.

The Sylvester homages of house-circuit fame are attractively soulful if a mite specialized--slower than us old-timers like our dance music, especially when we're not dancing. But from the first scrapes of its pseudosynth violin vamp, ""That's the Way Love Is"" shouts H-I-T--a classic pain-of-love cliche, all hooks and harmonies and going to the bridge. That it never broke pop is why old-timers get mad at Paula Abdul. The followup is a touch slower. I'm rooting for it anyway.

Terakaft are a livelier Tinariwen spinoff/breakaway featuring grooveful guitarist Diara and two spry nephews. Like all Tuareg musicians, they were exiled by the Islamist takeover of northern Mali, when, as several cryptic translations suggest, so many friends became enemies. Which may explain why this album doesn't manage quite the lift of 2011's Aratan N Azawad even with production input from Afropop good guy Justin Adams. Under the circumstances, lift's a lot to ask. But it is what they broke away for.

Tex is a novelty artist whose subject is morality, so that in one song a little old lady brains a mugger with a can of sauerkraut, in another Tex advocates tolerance for ""sissies,"" and in a third he sings a humorous chorus about having his hands cut off--all over some very punchy dance tracks by James Brown out of Stax-Volt. Amazingly rich and spirited for a comeback album off a freak hit.

In which an obscurity named Ben Barnes who probably doesn't want the press to know his age or how he brings in the extra-musical funds I'm sure he needs offers an object lesson in how to pull a lot of ass by projecting a sly, dirty sweetness, and in how to write striking songs about pulling a lot of ass by adding tunes to his winsome tales and come-ons. The catchiest of all is called ""Suicide Notes as Love Notes,"" and is preceded by one called ""Dr. Nuegurl"" that begins ""Dr. Nuegurl looks at me and says/That's what you get for fucking a 20-year-old."" The finale is called ""Happily Ever After,"" and I hope for the sake of whichever woman he's singing it to that he means it. For his sake too, actually. He is kind of attractive.

It's an old trick, this articulateness-in-inarticulateness, but in the words, the singing, the drumming, even the guitar (though you can tell the guitarist wants to be good real bad), this joke hardcore band that got lost on its way to college definitely has a bead on it. Start with side two, which rises from the singer as jollied-along asshole into smart and almost straight dope on Pleasant Valley teens, then quickly devolves into won't somebody come over, unhousetrained dog, demented half-audible vamp, and ""Tree 'n Sven Orbit the Planet,"" which is an instrumental, as it damn well better be.

Billed as greatest hits but actually just live, and not especially well-chosen by my no-more-or-less-idiosyncratic-than-theirs lights--where's ""How Can I Sing Like a Girl?""? And of course there are bait cuts, new songs their wee fan base presumably can't live without. What I wouldn't have figured is that ""Doctor Worm"" (""I'm not a real doctor but I am a real worm"") and ""They Got Lost"" (trying to find a radio station so low-watt it fades out no matter which way they turn), are my favorite things on a record that includes ""XTC Vs. Adam Ant"" and ""Meet James Ensor,"" reflexively clever titles I include as a guarantee that the songs live up to them.

They're such novelty nuts that trying to get into a groove with them would be like trying to build a go-kart with Legos. They're about individual pieces, not structural strength, and thus always demand a count. My calculation: overlooking the nine subminute snippets--most annoying even at that length, with bows to the nine-second ""Tick"" (""If it wasn't for that tick/We would not be in this predicament/Not be in this predicament that we're in,"" over and out) and the 24-second closer (she neither killed him nor made him stronger)--that leaves 16 songs that pretend to be songs, including one A plus, two clear A minuses, and six close enoughs. One of these is as strong as--and more soulful than--anything in their catalogue: the 2:04-minute biography ""Tesla."" Thumbs up as well to ""Black Ops,"" because it's always fun to hear the word ""communist"" in a song, and ""Replicants,"" because for some arbitrary reason it tickles me. The arbitrarily amusing--their specialty.

How about that--it's Peter and the Wolf. Thomas is a cabaret artist now, more at home for better or worse with arty Euroswingers like Chris Cutler and Lindsay Cooper than he ever was with roots-rockers deep down like Richard Thompson and Anton Fier. For a while there, his whimsy seemed arid and forced. Here, once again, he's palpably ""Enthusiastic.""

I assume they reprised the title song because they thought it was a sure shot, but they miscalculated, which is too bad--this album could use a sure shot. Thomas is deep, the material intelligent, and the mix of soul and disco disarmingly offhand. I like every cut except the gris-gris-for-tourists ""Princess La-La."" But I don't love a one of 'em.

Including an unredundant remake of a tune that merited two versions on his best-of as well as two other '80s hits he left off it, which was slick, this 2015 recording was cut in Accra, mixed in Berlin, and features Afrobeat trapmaster Tony Allen here and there. On ""Oye Hasem"" especially, second banana Ebo Taylor's horn arrangements get wearing, and Thomas definitely needs those chestnuts to tone up his tune stock. But for a new Afropop album with a subgenius frontman who has to be 60 by now, a stroke.

Moderate fame and/or extreme divorce has rendered Thompson predictable. He writes well-crafted songs about his love life, and while most of them are pretty good, only ""Fire in the Engine Room"" packs the old metaphorical wallop and only ""You Don't Say"" sneaks in the old emotional double-take. He does take leave of himself on ""Walking in a Wasted Land,"" the generalization level of which betrays yet another pop pro who should get out more, and whose guitar isn't going to save him forever.

From his vintage bike to his veiled belief that Salman Rushdie had it coming, the innate conservatism of this policeman's son is manifest, and at times his prejudices about artistic substance produce meaningful threnodies of no immediate artistic interest. But even the boring stuff goes somewhere, and nobody throws a meaner party. His tales of sex education and old 78s are so cranked up and cranky you wonder how you ever could have thought fun would be easy, and he gets almost as much mileage out of not understanding women as George Jones. Wonder whether George could get through the changes of ""I Misunderstood."" Or add a little zing to ""You Dream Too Much.""

I wish there were an American folk duo that combined such engaging music with such committed intelligence. (The McGarrigles don't count--they're Canadian.)

Back to Fairport conventions after their El Lay lies vanished into the ether, and of course it's a disgrace that an ""independent"" label won't let Americans hear the stomp and clang and clamor of real folk-rock--Richard's storehouse of strange licks, tunes, and styles just add to his axemanship, and Linda's acid contralto is a lead instrument. But though only the heavy-handed title satire lacks surface charm, the songwriting is thin--too many ordinary ideas aren't twisted the way his most striking phrases would have you believe. Also, are ""Justice in the Streets"" and its praise-Allah chorus about Teheran? Or am I just being paranoid?

FALSE,B+,Big Trash,The Thompson Twins,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6128,"
No one cares, but this is their best by miles. The singing is as characterless as ever, but at last their brains show, and when their well-named homage to Blondie and the B-52's adduces Salvador Dali, it leaves no doubt that they admire him as a charlatan, not an artist--or at least that they regard the two callings as closely related. So maybe the B-52's should hire Bailey/Currie when they need something catchy and meaningless, as they do. Deborah Harry did just that last year and wound up with a side-opener.

Next to Grand Funk, they're the country's top touring act, and they sell singles in the multiple millions besides. They're slick as Wesson Oil. And when they choose the right material and go light on the minstrel-show theatrics, they're fine--next to ""Maggie May,"" ""Joy to the World"" is the most durable single of the year. Their albums do vary--avoid the ""Joy to the World"" vehicle Naturally--but I think this is the best. Even if you're hostile, you'll have to concede that any group that can string together great-but-obscure songs from Marvin Gaye, Joni Mitchell, and Moby Grape without inspiring a rush back to the originals has something going for it. Wish they'd cut the poetry reading, though.

Things seem to be winding up for the Kings of Oversing, but this fourteen-song compilation demonstrates that the singles, unlike the albums, didn't diminish much. It also suggests that though they're praised when at all for translating weirdos like Nilsson and Newman into AM, they also deserve credit for preserving the odd goody (two apiece) by the likes of Paul Williams and Hoyt Axton. Only Lighthouse keeper Skip Prokop proves beyond help.

Don't you wish you knew some Americans who could cop snatches of Jimmie Rodgers and the Golden Gate Singers and ""Don't You Start Me Talking"" and ""The Night Has a Thousand Eyes"" without imitating any of them? These are guys who not only consider it their mission to keep rock and roll ""The Devil's Music"" for as long as the world goes to hell, but who also don't want the world to go to hell.

With its DOR beat and football-disco chorale, the title track of their sixth EP since 1983 is a deceptively catchy antiyuppie rallying cry, and all three tunes on the B--especially ""Crazytown,"" the theme song of a hundred more forgettable bands--are worth hearing twice. This is more than can be said of the B fodder on EP number five, Death of the European, soon to be rendered altogether extraneous by the appearance of its title track on their second album.

There's half a carload of new songs from a writing machine that's already filled two LPs and two EPs since 1985.

The Johns' maiden release, 1982's ""English White Boy Engineer,"" exports the U.K. equivalent of Timbuk 3's nuclear science major to South Africa, where he blames the bad stuff on the Afrikaners. Great. But in general this reminds us that a single is what a cult band puts out when it doesn't have enough songs for an album. Some of it is upstanding rant, like ""AWOL."" Some of it, wouldn't you know, is EP-tested, like ""Brainbox"" and (that again?) ""Death of the European."" And some of it is pure B-side, like the beatbox showcase ""Two Minute Ape.""

For the how-many-hundredth time, it's the punk miracle, here performed by late-twentysomething singer-guitarist Kory Seal with help from older sister Jessie Seal on drums and backup vocals plus a bassist friend. The tempos are brisk but seldom speedy as the tunes mine the nursery-rhyme and playground-chant riches of punk drone and whine, with Kory laying in guitar hooks whenever he intuits we might be getting bored. His core attitude is earned alienation, his ""I'm always just gonna be me"" neither boast or self-laceration. By living ""Paycheck to Paycheck"" he earns the right to dis the ""Struggling Artist"" whose parents pay the rent. But he backs it up by branding ""fuck the government"" ""an excuse,"" by admitting he should ""interact with people,"" and by wondering where the ""Lonely Webcam Girl""'s parents are.

Either they're the best Senegalese band to surface since Baaba Maal's or David Murray has gotten a hell of a record out of them. A conflict-primed groove launches Tidiane Gaye's tenor into transports of falsetto, and jazz-steeped guest altoist Abdoulaye N'Diaye links Dakar to New York more idiomatically than Murray could have. Their name, meaning something like Work-Reward, is the slogan of Cheikh Ibrahim Fall, a leader of the same Sufilike Muridist brotherhood that counts among its adherents Youssou N'Dour and Senegal's current president.

True folkies, the MacDonalds evolve toward lyric sincerity--or on the debut single, an obvious stiff (which doesn't mean a terrible song), straight sarcasm. Occasionally they get away clean--""A Sinful Life"" tugs at my heartstrings for sure. But crooked sarcasm remains their special gift. I'm happy not to know whether they consider the disco champs of ""Dance Fever"" winners or losers in the end. And I wonder whether their latest foray into tape technology, ""Sample the Dog,"" couldn't break from further out in left field than ""Future's So Bright"" did.

""Dirty Dirty Rice"" is the single, and before you say, ""Just what we need, another song about soul food,"" give them credit--that would be ""Dirty Rice."" Dirty dirty rice is a street delicacy available in the dumpster of your local Popeye's, and releasing singles about such stuff could keep them on ""the B side of life"" for the rest of their natural days. Since they not only cop to the prospect but can live with it--""I like my free time and I love my wife""--I predict that their songs will remain winsome and wise for as long as the record company puts them out. And that they could hit the jackpot again without trying.

This is certainly the most ""conceptual"" of the three Morris Day showcases, but ""Jungle Love"" certainly digs as deep a pocket as ""Cool"" or ""The Walk,"" and the two spoken-word tracks are outrageous, weird, and waggish enough to hold up against Morris's dubious (mock?) confessional ballads on What Time Is It?

In a misguided attempt to correct for personal affection, I underrated these Akron prog-jokers' 1979 Contents Dislodged During Shipment, their only major-label and non-retrospective album. So I'm not about to make the same mistake with this one just because my wife and I wrote the liner notes (for free, speaking of personal affection). It's a hodgepodge of course, including several unusually useful live or otherwise alternate versions. But after putting it aside for a while, I find that it rarely lets down as it herks and jerks between free jazz and tight postpunk and theoretical Zombies and the usual array of key changes and tempo shifts in pursuit of what I once dubbed ""the eternal secret of the whoopee cushion."" The official album's better, and I am a fan as well as a friend. But why shouldn't I be?

Musically, Oakland's finest is a throwback, his repetitive monotone trailing midtempo drum-machine beats embellished by low-tech scratches, simple bass and guitar lines, and other synthesized band noises. Not exactly uplifting, either--though he extols the hard haul that got him his Benz, he accepts ""freaks"" and ""rock cocaine"" as viable career alternatives, and in general is as matter-of-factly despairing as anyone who opposes suicide can be. Thing is, despair suits the ""City of Dope,"" the generic urban dystopia that the hards down south half-wittingly glamorize with their fancy samples and staged defiance.

FALSE,B+,Toots in Memphis,Toots,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4024,"
From Sam or Dave or Wilson Pickett these oldies would be the latest nostalgia move, but Otis's greatest student has always been shy of the soul songbook: for him, a new batch of reggae is the past he can't escape and Stax-Hi the chance of a lifetime. Like all aging soul men, he can no longer flush out the gravel at will, but the vocalese is incorrigibly exuberant, the material ranges within the concept, and Sly &amp; Robbie synthesize the unimaginable groove you'd expect.

FALSE,B+,Reggae Got Soul,Toots and the Maytals,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4021,"
In Toots the physical voice is all but equivalent to the artistic ""voice,"" the way that term is applied to poets sometimes, and all its warmth, humor, and vivacity come through here. But what has made Toots doubly impressive is the amazing hit songs his voice was attached to. For starters: ""Sweet and Dandy,"" ""5446 Was My Number,"" ""Monkey Man,"" and ""African Doctor."" None of these has been released on an American Maytals album, and nothing on this album, not even ""Rasta Man"" or ""True Love Is Hard to Find,"" equals any of them.

FALSE,B+,Pass the Pipe,Toots and the Maytals,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8009,"
This isn't as well-crafted song for song as Reggae Got Soul, but because it doesn't assume that ""soul"" equals U.S. success it's a lot less confused, and I like it more. The music's momentum is unimpeded by bad faith, and the three compositions that do stand out--especially ""Famine,"" as amazing a juxtaposition of horror and good cheer as Jimmy Cliff's ""Viet Nam""--sound like great ones.

FALSE,B+,Toots Live,Toots and the Maytals,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8511,"
Toots's spirit and improvisatory verve merit a concert LP, and for a while I thought this one might double as a best-of--I was even ready to hold my fire on the inevitable remake of ""Funky Kingston"" when offered the first U.S.-album version of his magnificent ""5446 Was My Number."" But the exigencies of crowd control induce Toots to work that bittersweet ex-con's victory cry as a shoutalong, and when something similar happens to the climactic ""Time Tough"" I give up. Toots's ability to exult in suffering (cf. the unfortunately omitted ""Famine"") may be a miracle, but loaves and fishes it ain't. So why should a multitude join in?

Since there's more ""world music"" than anybody can hear, not to mention enjoy, often preferences are arbitrary. No aficionado of Spanish romanticism, I've never gotten into salsa, but I happened to go see Toro at S.O.B.'s, where I was won over by his unassuming fingerpicked mastery of the cuatro (kind of a large 10-string mandolin), as well as the unassuming cornball showmanship of his group. Maybe that's why I like his sweet mountain record better than, say, Daniel Ponce's hot city record or Nana Vasconcelos's big ethnomusicological record on the same label, or maybe it's because I've always resisted horny bands while favoring the simple charanga this vaguely recalls. A salsa trumpeter I know says he likes it too--sound reminds him of Penguin Cafe Orchestra.

What's most impressive about this music is its sinew. The tracks are strong, yet although they usually include at least seven instrumental parts, they never sound lush, full, or even jubilantly multipercussive, which given Tosh's increasingly ominous lyrics is a good thing. Yet while Tosh's lyrics are more correct politically than Marley's, they're only marginally more eloquent. His singing is rather less eloquent.

Who knows what got him--some combination of ganja and the screws beating him half to death just when his music took its definitive downturn in the late '70s. Anyway, by finessing his recent past--only four tracks less than seven years old--compiler Neil Spencer camouflages the sad deterioration of one Jamaican artist whose hazy alienation always had a political edge. Sly &amp; Robbie, great Mick Jagger cameo--it's enough to make a charitable person forgive the insufferable ""Mystic Man,"" which is of course included.

Toussaint relies on overdubbing to camouflage his often colorless delivery and occasionally colorless songwriting. But if going solo stretches him thin, it also stretches him--the phasing-and-saxophone on ""Goin' Down"" is a producer's dream come true, ""Victims of the Darkness"" is recommended to Norman Whitfield, and on ""Out of the City"" he reminds us that in the country ""the grass is greener on every side.""

You know what they mean by calling this a disco group? They mean that all the fast songs sound pretty good and all the slow ones don't.

Among the attractions of this compilation of disco hits going back to 1972 are three snappy originals, Mr. Bass Man, a rock and roll version of ""Zing Went the Strings of My Heart,"" and a disco version of ""Sixty Minute Man"" that divides him in two.

The five-minute version of Wilson Pickett's ""Ninety-Nine and a Half"" is the key to this album. Jimmy Ellis can't match the depth of the original, and neither can the rhythm arrangement, which is light, festooned with horn licks, fanciful if you like it and just fancy if you don't. But if you like it it's not only fanciful but functional--that is, danceable. As are the other six cuts on this album, the two forgettable ones as well as the four catchy ones.

Traore has been walking a tightrope since her 2000 debut, and it's not getting easier. There's limited outreach in any tongue to songs about your right to pursue a musical career albeit--translation from the Bamanan provided--""Brought up by the rules of the nobility/Forbidden to sing or speak in public."" Escaped from the Malian troubles in Paris, she recorded her fourth album with Polly Jean Harvey adjutant John Parish, and musically they get results--from the opener on out, Scottish drummer Seb Rochford and Italian guitarist Stefano Pilia make Mali rock in ways unknown to Oumou Sangare or Bassekou Kouyate, and Traore is less pretty in turn. But non-Bamanan speakers may well find that her supple vocals are no more engaging should they follow her unremarkable spiritual tribulations in English or French. And non-Bamanan speakers who only start paying attention with the rote English-language populism of the continental and womanist praisesongs at the end may never go back and read along.

With his rotogravure cover and spare instrumentation, Nashville's hot new thing cultivates an aura of neotraditionalist quality, as is the fashion these days. Fortunately, the quality at least is real. He sounds like an unspoiled John Anderson singing the material of a lucky George Strait.

Travis doesn't get lucky on this one, which is dragged like most country albums by its quota of ordinary--maybe ""Singing the Blues"" should be ceded permanently to Guy Mitchell.

As always, the auteur with his name in big letters has a mild voice and a mild sense of humor: in this case, he used to be in the Sopwith Camel and cuts his pastoral whimsy with a synthesizer.

EPs are still supposed to showcase emerging bands, but many of the best are true ends in themselves if not totally sui generis, like this impossible answer record, which proves who was the body and maybe soul although not brains of the Velvet Underground. With forever-young Jad Fair playing front man, they run through three joyous VU obscurities, a Jimmy Reed blues, and a throwaway instrumental just the way the original guys might have if jaded hadn't been their thing.

The illusion of commercial potential that induced the Velvets to tighten up without squelching their experimental impulses can't be sustained by any Moe smart enough to have come this far, and so, encouraged by her loony Half Japanese bandmates, she wastes valuable minutes fucking around. Songs meander, her third ""Bo Diddley"" in three albums still doesn't get it, the endless instrumental is Sonic Youth in runny jam mode. Except for the jam, it's all nice enough--Tucker's modest middle-aged housewife is an innovation in much the way her drumming once was. But ""Work,"" ""Spam Again,"" and ""Hey Mersh!"" are Amerindie knockouts, lived postpunk takes on the grind and release of lower-middle class adulthood, a subject rock and rollers usually leave to Nashville company men.

But she and Ike really put their increasingly unfashionable rough-and-greasy notion of soul out there, and despite the speeches, backup singers, and guitar demonstrations a lot of their show is captured in disc.

Tina hasn't regained her voice, which makes this recovery a certain rather than a likely fluke, but I find happy accidents in every cut except maybe ""Drift Away."" Highlights include the nutball title hit, a stripped-down ""River Deep, Mountain High,"" a tribute to East St. Louis's ""Club Manhattan,"" and ""That's My Purpose,"" keyed to a line I happen to be a sucker for: ""Let your face be the last I see.""

Charges that Tina has betrayed her precious heritage come twenty years too late--not since she and Ike reeled off five straight r&amp;b top-tens between 1960 and 1962 has she pursued the black audience with any notable passion. Her benefactors of the late '60s were Phil Spector, Bob Krasnow, the Rolling Stones, and the Las Vegas International Hotel, where she and Ike were fixtures at the time of Elvis's comeback; their big numbers of the early '70s were the totemic rock anthems ""Come Together"" and ""Proud Mary."" That she should now realize the pop fabrications of white svengalis is just a couple more steps down the same appointed path, and she's damned good at it, even an innovator--Private Dancer remains the archetypal all-singles all-hits multiproducer crossover, and Whitney Houston should be so soulful. Unfortunately, the follow-up musters no archetypal crossover singles, and no totemic rock anthems either (Bryan Adams induces her to go metal, which is more than Bowie or Knopfler can claim). Fortunately, ranking svengali Terry Britten gets his own state-of-the-pop-art side. If he and Tina can't convince you that rich people have feelings too, you're some kind of bigot for sure.

They're ten-year pros from Jamaica's north coast--rather than Kingston, hence the title--whose hotel gigs have taught them the ins and outs of soul (and doowop?), and though this isn't as upbeat as their signature ""Rasta P'on Top,"" it shows a range no competing harmony group approaches.

The music of this Harlem crew is loud beats anchored to spare guitar, the hip hop obverse of death metal if death metal didn't always strain for drama. In between the bleakest, strongest crack track ever and realest, losingest prison track this side of the Lifers Group comes the autobiography of some Nino Brown or other, only the last we see of him he's still counting his money; fuck Bensonhurst, he says, but that doesn't stop him from enslaving his own people, and the rappers append no warning, no moral.

After much listening, I am not convinced that Tyner is the total pianist. True, there are more ideas per minute on his simultaneously released solo album, Echoes of a Friend, than on Keith Jarrett's Solo Concerts. But the mystical empty spaces that Jarrett explores or exploits do have an irreducible validity that a bad idea does not, and unfortunately, Tyner is not above bad ideas, especially those Tatumesque flourishes with which jazz buffs satisfy their craving for soppy romance. (Why is the rock an droll fan listening to solo piano albums at all? The rock and roll fan is not always sure himself.) But Tyner's failings, which aren't major anyway, are less egregious in an ensemble setting like this one. At its best, this music breathes with a lushness and lyricism that never cloys: the melodies and harmonies and polyrhythms are sensuous without coming on about it. Strength that never offends.

Unlike most of her cocharting cofemales, Ullman has undertaken a conscious genre exercise--she plays girl-group tradition for naive if not dumb passivity. The songs new and old are tuneful and right, the production exquisitely not-quite-schlocky, but just-compare her ""Bobby's Girl"" to Marcie Blaine's original--Ullman sings with too much force and skill to make the conceit convincing. On the other hand, it's probably her musical conscience that saves the project from unmitigated ""ironic"" condescension. ""They Don't Know"" did hit at face value, after all.

After a year of fix-it-in-the-mix, the gutsier audio of this long-awaited U.S. version just doesn't transform the harmolodic guitarmaster's Rough Trade debut into a sow's ear. It's still too stiff, too composed, too contained, not (primarily) because the sound is too thin, but because at a mean 4:20 the tracks are too damn short. The compositions are so brilliant they never relax or rock out, and Olu Dara and Oliver Lake get in David Murray's way. Hemmed in by crossfire, the sextet never finds room to wail with the ecstatic power of the classic Tin Palace quartet, which always did justice to what Ulmer loves about his three favorite local rock bands--not just the arrant Colemanism of the Contortions, but the surprising harsh angularity of the Voidoids and the climactic dynamics of the Feelies. Though they implode with more brains and soul than any fusion mucksters, they never bust loose. Which is half the concept, right?

FALSE,B+,Free Lancing,James Blood Ulmer,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1630,"
Ulmer's conception is so audacious, so singular, that he can't cut a bad record--his most pro forma moments would make you sit up and notice ordinary jazz-rock. But despite his uncanny one-take double-track drone and the polyrhythmic facility of Amin Ali and Calvin Weston, I find the trio format thin here, and the three lyrics are trivial compared to ""Are You Glad to Be in America?"" and ""Jazz Is the Teacher."" Recommended to unbelievers and George Clinton: the hard, horny funk of ""High Time.""
"
FALSE,B+,Part Time,James Blood Ulmer,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8542,"
Cut at Montreux around the time of Odyssey, Ulmer's strongest LP, this repeats four titles and is close to his weakest. The live recording dulls his sonic concept, with only ""Swing and Things,"" compacted into 3:27, providing compensation. Which isn't to say he doesn't still outrock Pat Metheny, or that ""Encore,"" the most striking of the three new tunes, shouldn't get an encore.
"
FALSE,B+,Live at the Caravan of Dreams,James Blood Ulmer,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8543,"
Decked out like a rent-a-pasha on the colorized cover, bellowing/muttering lyrics he might as well be making up on the spot (""Gonna get me a cow and dick around""?--nah, can't be), Blood's too wild and woolly for his own good here. But if wild and woolly is the price of live and well, his admirers should be happy to pay up.
"
FALSE,B+,Live,"The James ""Blood"" Ulmer Blues Experience",1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1633,"
The advantage of this live album over Ulmer's studio blues isn't choice material but excess guitar. He's a more proficient (jazz) composer than (r&amp;b) songwriter and a more exciting player than either. His funky rhythm section has slipped into blues-rock, and that he was one of the first jazzmen to understand why Hendrix treated his axe as a noisemaker doesn't mean he commands Hendrix's palette--although he's gotten louder with the years, he still reverts to single-string lines. But with Sonny Sharrock dead, he smokes the competition. Guitar diehards should get hip to this wild, solid cross-section of a seminal genre buster.
"
FALSE,B+,Systems of Romance,Ultravox,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8060,"
This time these guys have mastered their concept. John Foxx's detached, creamy baritone works against the instrumentation's electronic cast for a streamlined rocksy music that suits titles like ""Dislocation"" and ""Someone Else's Clothes."" But unlike Bryan Ferry Foxx talks as if he's detached clean through, unlike Brian Eno he's encumbered by delusions of existential significance, and unlike both he's never funny.
"
FALSE,B+,The Undertones,The Undertones,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3889,"
Nice lads, nice lads--suddenly the world is teeming with nice lads. I like their punky speed and adolescent authenticity, but I'd prefer the reverse--among adolescents these days the speed takes care of itself, while finding something besides teendom to write about is a problem.

FALSE,B+,Positive Touch,The Undertones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8546,"
""Here's more songs about chocolate and girls/It's not so easy knowing they'll be heard""? No, that was last time. Here's still more, and it's even harder--not being sure whether they'll be heard or not (at least in the land across the sea) is worst of all. Nevertheless, the boys are equal to the task--just about every one of the fourteen is catchy and felt. Almost inevitably, though, the arrangements are a little fancier, to no special avail, and the same goes for the subjects. Good luck, lads.

FALSE,B+,Dream Sequence,The Unknowns,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8547,"
Near the top of the post-power pops, nasty and catchy instead of cute and same, is a Georgia-rooted L.A. quartet led by a guy who wields a mean-looking cane and suffers mean-looking tics, both of which he seems to need. Former Rachel Sweet svengali Liam Sternberg recommended the offbeats and echoed guitar that twist these loose-limbed tunes so neatly. Start with side two, which starts with ""Suzzanne.""
"
FALSE,B+,Lethal,UTFO,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8552,"
They got no principles, so they head for the street, where rap albums sell--with its skeezer, its hard-on, and its dozens, even ""Let's Get It On"" isn't radio-ready. At their most B-boy, they tempt me to organize a boycott of my fellow ""suckers"" and ""fags,"" but they do it with flair, and though the quotation marks around ""Lethal"" and ""Diss"" will be widely misconstrued, they satisfy my admittedly flexible irony requirement. Not only that, ""The Ride"" is a dick rap that burns rubber, and ""Burning Bed"" is a better half's revenge.
"
FALSE,B+,War,U2,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4062,"
The deadly European virus that's always tainted this band turns out to be their characteristic melodic device, a medieval-sounding unresolved fifth frequently utilized by monks in Hollywood movies. In other respects, however, their hot album is rock and roll indeed. The Edge becomes a tuneful guitarist by the simple expedient of not soloing, and if Bono has too many Gregorian moments his conviction still carries the music. Anyway, I'll take his militant if pacifist Christianity (""The real battle has begun/To claim the victory Jesus won"") over most of the secular humanism and Jah love rockers are going in for these days.
"
FALSE,B+,The Unforgettable Fire,U2,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4063,"
Eno has shaped this record to accentuate Bono's wild romantic idealism, and while I prefer his moral force I have to admit that the two are equally beguiling to contemplate and dangerous to take literally. The romanticism gets out of hand with the precious expressionism of ""Elvis Presley and America"" (enough to make the King doubt this boy's virility), the moralism with the turn-somebody-else's-cheek glorification of Martin Luther King's martyrdom (death stings plenty where I live). But he gets away with it often enough to make a skeptic believe temporarily in miracles.
"
FALSE,B+,Rattle and Hum,U2,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4065,"
Pretentious? Eux? Naturellement, mais that ain't all. Over the years they've melded Americana into their Old World riffs, and while Bono's ""Play the blues, Edge"" overstates this accomplishment, their groove is some kind of rock and roll wrinkle. This partly live double-LP is looser and faster than anything they've recorded since their first live mini-LP, with the remakes of ""Pride"" and ""Silver and Gold"" and ""Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" improved by both practice and negligence. A good half of the new stuff could knock over unsuspecting skeptics, the B.B./Hendrix/Dylan cameos are surprising and generous, and as a token of self-knowledge Bono concludes a lecture on South Africa with a magisterially sarcastic ""I don't wanna bug ya."" Yet as usual things don't get any better when you decide to find out exactly what he's waxing so meaningful about.
"
FALSE,B+,Never Too Much,Luther Vandross,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8554,"
In music as tactful as this, where so much of the meaning is carried on the skip and flow of rhythm and timbre, songwriting doesn't matter all that much. So Vandross can attach tropes like ""sugar and spice"" and ""she's a super lady"" to undistinguished melodies and make me like them. But when his touch is just a little off, the great hit single you've just heard (or at least the good one that's sure to follow) seems almost as forgettable as the loser he's singing.
"
FALSE,B+,"Forever, for Always, for Love",Luther Vandross,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8555,"
Well, depends on what you mean by love--like any studio habitue Vandross is a sensualist at heart, an aural libertine who revels in sheer sound at the expense of any but the most received sense. His voice is so luxuriant I can understand why fans go all the way with him. But only on ""She Loves Me Back"" (set apart by the hard K at the end of the title phrase) do I really love him back myself.
"
FALSE,B+,The Night I Fell in Love,Luther Vandross,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8557,"
Though Vandross's devotion to pure singing will always be too pure to admit much content, his material has improved. Marcus Miller makes the fast ones hop to, and the ballads retain their shape no matter how far Luther stretches them--only dud's the ridiculously well-named ""My Sensitivity (Gets in the Way)."" On ""It's Over Now"" Mr. Nice Guy even orders his treat-him-bad woman to ""hit the road""--although it is his femme backups who utter the actual words.
"
FALSE,B+,1984,Van Halen,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8562,"
Side one is pure up, and not only that, it sticks to the ears: their pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops. Side two is consolation for their loyal fans--a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called ""House of Pain.""
"
FALSE,B+,Vanity 6,Vanity 6,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8565,"
The latest Prince creation is a male fantasy even if the girls did write the lyrics themselves, and Vanity's insistence on seven-inch dicks would have made me feel insecure before I discovered hormone treatments. But all eight of these dumb, dancy little synth tunes get me off when I let my guard down, and most of them are funny, hooky, and raunchy at the same time.

FALSE,B+,Van Ronk,Dave Van Ronk,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8064,"
Although I've always thought Van Ronk was hard to listen to--after all, his range is about half an octave--what he does with songs by fellow ""nonsingers"" like Peter Stampfel, Leonard Cohen, and Randy Newman makes me think some more. He shoots his shot at big-label production here, and now and then the orchestration (not to mention the material) turns surprisingly schmaltzy, but for the most part this shouted melee of song collection is a riot.
"
FALSE,B+,Sex With an X,The Vaselines,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15921,"
Back when Frances McKee and Eugene Kelly were charming the eyelashes off Kurt Cobain, they were a couple, and when they stopped being one they stopped being the Vaselines. Twenty years later give or take, they were friendly exes who'd never really found anything better to do. So to have some fun and pick up a spot of change, they got together and, no longer able to extrude their couplehood, instead said ""Let's write some Vaselines songs."" Title notwithstanding, there's somewhat less sex in these, and listeners who set store in self-expression might conclude that the slight dip in urgency reflects the new material's factitious origins. Compared to so many reunion albums, however, it's like they never left. Simple, funny, acerbic, tuneful, they're a cabaret act for people who can't play their instruments but have some facile friends with nothing better to do either.
"
FALSE,B+,Couldn't Stand the Weather,Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3344,"
The problem with guitar virtuosos is that most of them wouldn't know a good musical concept if they tripped over it, which happens just often enough to keep everyone confused. The exception that proves not a damn thing is Jimi Hendrix, the finest guitarist in any idiom ever. Though he comes close sometimes, this Texan ain't Hendrix. But between earned Jimi cover and lyric refreshment, album two is almost everything a reasonable person might hope from him: a roadhouse album with gargantuan sonic imagination.
"
FALSE,B+,Soul to Soul,Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8566,"
All right, all right--he's a great guitarist, and an intermittently commanding vocalist. Unlike most Hendrixites he can step a sharp shuffle, and unlike most Texas boogiemen he's a great guitarist. But he's still not a great or even commanding artist, because the classic album he has in him, Jimi Boogies, keeps getting ruined by installments of Stevie Ray Shows Off. This moves along right nice, especially on side two--until Vaughan elects to close with a long slow soulful one that only gets going with a Hendrix coda.
"
FALSE,B+,Stop Those Songs,V-Effect,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8568,"
Either Ann Rupel's vocals and David Zonzinsky's vocals and sax got squashed in the machinery somewhere or else their cheerful onstage chutzpah concealed chronic difficulties with breath production. Too bad--few bands anywhere make better rock and roll on the edge of artistic and political struggle. This may be because, as Zonzinsky likes to say, they're ""leftist"" rather than ""political"": their clarity of purpose helps them avoid the ingrown cacophony that their supposed comrades consider an improvement on programmatic oversimplification.

FALSE,B+,Velocity,The Vels,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8571,"
These three Steven Stanley-produced Philadelphians don't just dance in their heads. Not only do they command the spare formal pop eloquence that many popdance minimalists claim and few get next to, they have a generous regard for pop pleasure. Their simple hooks add up to full-fledged tunes, their basic-English lyrics are more than runes. And singer Alice DeSoto is unaffected and vivacious, a rare combination.

A taste for mbube, isichatamiya, ingoma ebusuku, or what these notes call cothoza will never come naturally to Americans, but if Ladysmith got you interested, try this. The sharp, nasal leads are dominated for the non-Zulu ear by waggish effects that are probably more sound than sense anyway--whoops, rattles, repartee, animal calls. In short, it's not especially beautiful, which is good. How many Joseph Shabalalas can there be? How many do you want?
"
FALSE,B+,Words from the Front,Tom Verlaine,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3992,"
Verlaine's ever-resourceful guitar has always been more richly endowed with mood and effect than with the hook riffs that make him a great rock-and-roller, and here for the first time things get too atmospheric. ""Postcard From Waterloo"" is a classic, but the strangulated vocals and expressionistic structures suggest that he really should get out more.

That's as in Afrikaner--e.g., vocalist/bassist/drum programmer Ren������������������ Veldsman, who cut this strange little record with Michele Howe two ""Sun City."" It's all rhythm and soulful chants/shouts that with the help of the electronic drums come across distanced rather than passionate. This seems appropriate, somehow--I don't miss the cloying sincerity of such white Africans as Johnny Clegg and Tony Bird. And n.b.: beyond a pleas to ""Save Crocodiles"" on the back cover, there are no politics here at all.

One band with two names so it could record over quota when it managed the journey to the studio in Nairobi, Vijana Jazz Band and its Koka Koka Sex Battalion doppelganger favored the typical East African iteration of soukous's rippling guitars. Sometimes this approach is compared to country music, but that's a metaphor, not a musical analogy--these guys aren't true soloists, and rarely is Nashville guitar so ramshackle. In East African rumba, guitars provide atmosphere more than content. The content's in the jocosely hectoring vocals and single-line saxophone interjections, which with this enjoyable little band are numerous and various enough to engage non-Swahili speakers who find some of the melodies warm and others tepid.

I give up--I've never been capable of resisting music this silly. At least this time they're not singing the praises of ""macho,"" a term whose backlash resurgence is no laughing matter, and the gay stereotyping--right down to ""The Women,"" every one a camp heroine of screen or disc--is so cartoonish that I can't imagine anyone taking it seriously. As for all the straights who think ""Y.M.C.A."" is about playing basketball, well, that's pretty funny too. But what happens when Victor Willis follows Teddy Pendergrass into sololand and reveals the wife and 2.4 kids in the closet?

He lived in England after almost dying young there, which was all this greasy-looking, airy-sounding ex-sailor needed to become a rockabilly legend. But Stateside he's remembered, when you get down to it, for precisely one record: his first and biggest, ""Be-Bop-a-Lula."" I bought it in 1956 and instantly adjudged its Elvisoid B side, ""Woman Love,"" a perfect cartoon of slavering lust, an opinion I hold to this day. Although he's a better legend than artist, Vincent and his Blue Caps also deserve credit for the chart-certified ""Bluejean Bop"" and ""Lotta Lovin'"" as well as a string of lesser rockers. Topped by ""B-I Bickey-Bi, Bo-Bo-Go"" and the barely chart-certified ""Race With the Devil,"" these include ""Git It"" and ""Baby Blue,"" neither of which I'd heard before his company put Vincent back in catalogue with this overenthusiastic CD-market compilation. But there's also the inexplicably omitted ""Who Slapped John?"" and ""Five Feet of Lovin',"" and ""She She Little Sheila,"" supposedly slated for a followup devoted to his Later Work. I await the second Fats Domino. And swear you should hear ""Woman Love"" once before you die.

If Jonathan Richman thought he was as sexy as Richard Hell, he'd come on like Gordon Gano. And if you believe Jonathan Richman damn well is as sexy as Richard Hell, which Gano is counting on, remember that what makes Jonathan's kiddie act so (shall we say) appealing is that he counts on nothing except his fingers and toes. Gano knows his stuff--the barely electric music is striking enough for rock and roll. But for all its undeniable humor and panache the effect is precious, wimp bohemianism so self-congratulatory it'll be sucking its own wee-wee next time we look.

If you can imagine mid-'70s Eno hung up on the Flesh Eaters (or a Gaelic counterpart that's somehow escaped my notice) and the Boomtown Rats, you'll get an idea of how these metronomic, exotophile Irishpeople sound, if not of why I enjoy them so thoroughly--which is probably because Eno abandoned the mid-'70s all too soon.

FALSE,B+,Feet on Fire,Virunga,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6162,"
Samba Mapangala is no titan--just a persistent pro with studio smarts whose career path took him to East Africa instead of France. A women's wedding song retrofitted with male chauvinist lyrics provides a stolen high. There are telling touches from English session men playing sax and accordion. And the record is definitely his kind of soukous anyway.

First side's got everything an insatiable Mission of Burma (or H������������������sker D������������������) fan could ask except Richard Harte's production, which might do justice to the band's command of detail.

Finally an album that captures the half of Mission of Burma who didn't turn to chamber music--the half that's half joke band--in all their half-assed glory.

They've learned their lessons well, ripping off riffs from everybody--what can you say when two slapshticking ex-Mothers steal a melody from a Graham Nash protest song?--and filtering it down into the finest pasteurized mush. For some reason, it sounds a lot like the Turtles. A charming exercise in the deliberate throwback category, a true artyfact. Recommended: the Hawaiian novelty, ""Nikki Hoi.""
"
FALSE,B+,Get to the Heart,Jane Voss & Hoyle Osborne,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8582,"
There's only one Irving Berlin song here, but it's Berlin's vulgar, magnanimous, democratic tunefulness that Voss claims for the folkie sensibility. And though her voice sure isn't as strong as Bessie Smith's, as she's good enough to point out in another tribute, she also wants to wail and moan. So where Joan Morris does Berlin by simulating the careful pitch and intonation of '20s pop singers, who still cowered in the shadow of operetta, Voss flats her melodies shamelessly, sounding half like a jazz improviser and half like Sister in her cups and/or parlor. Pianist Osborne is squarer than need be and composer Voss sometimes runs on at the mouth, but get to the heart they do.

FALSE,B+,You and Your Sister,The Vulgar Boatmen,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3901,"
These guys make much more than you expect out of what first sounds like almost nothing--just tuneful enough to warrant play two, their mild jangle gains sweetness and kick as your faith increases. But their lyrics come from an English prof who may be too much the formalist to say what he wants but more likely just doesn't know what he wants: hoping for more ""Change the World All Around,"" what you get instead is six minutes of ""Drive Somewhere."" It's such a great riff you wouldn't care if it kept going, either. But an honorable, self-aware nowhere is where it'll end up.

This expanded version of Solomonic's 1979 In I Father's House isn't primo Bunny. Even the nicely dubwise ""Rockers"" is flatter than side one of Rock 'n' Groove; what's more, the sacramental Tribute and the upful Hook Line 'n Sinker have me waiting on his soon-come live album. Nevertheless, this is a worthy sample of the unjudgmental preachments and reliable rhythms of Jamaica's solidest solo artist, and if you buy it maybe there'll be more.

Though his voice echoes more hollowly than the most scientific dubmaster would ever intend, the only concert the man's given in seven years sounds like it was a natural thing. His best studio albums have more distinct identities, but this is where to sample his invincible spirit.

FALSE,B+,Album II,Loudon Wainwright III,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8073,"
In which Wainwright untwists the dense associations--usually too literal and/or analytic to qualify as metaphor--that made his first album so hard to take, though for those who'd like to sample the mode ""Be Careful, There's a Baby in the House"" is as good as it gets. He may make you laugh, but he's not trying to be funny--this is bitter stuff whether he's trying to persuade a groupie to save his life or to explain that an old friendship has gone from backslap to handshake.
"
FALSE,B+,T Shirt,Loudon Wainwright III,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8074,"
Loudon seems to be approaching sanity as he approaches thirty, and while that bodes well for his career it won't help his (you'll pardon the expression) his art much. He needs one song as astonishing as ""Rufus Is a Tit Man"" every time out.
"
FALSE,B+,Final Exam,Loudon Wainwright III,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2129,"
The renewed bite here seems more a sign that producer John Lissauer has a knack for the exquisite programmatic effect--check out the Roches' demure buffoonery on ""Golfin' Blues"" or the way the band calls Loudon ""Mr. Guilty""--than that Wainwright is once again willing to apply his scalpel to himself. It was always brave, painful jokes like ""Motel Blues"" and ""Kick in the Head"" that gave the rest of his funny stuff its strength, and their absence from his two most recent albums may be why even his best new songs sound like one-liners rather than comic classics. Lotsa great one-liners, though.
"
FALSE,B+,A Live One,Loudon Wainwright III,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2130,"
The cheap seats are the only seats at a Wainwright show, and too often he plays to them, but here the screwy faces and strangled diction and spastic phrasing and easy jokes are kept in check. It's not as if his albums are so ornately orchestrated that the man-and-his-guitar format is a breath of fresh air. But he's a singer-songwriter who deserves a best-of, and this will do till he gets it.

FALSE,B+,I'm Alright,Loudon Wainwright III,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8588,"
Last time he was complacent in defeat, his irony all sarcasm and his permanent postadolescence an annoying bore. This time he's facing up--not to anything existential or absurd, that stuff comes too easy, but to what it might mean to make an alright career (and life) out of ""unhappy love."" The result is discernibly superior to the perfectly enjoyable one-liner miscellanies of the late '70s and not quite there even so. Just rooting for the Rangers and having his doubts about bell-bottom pants once made him a (very minor) prophet; now they make him normal. My suggestion: a concept album about having kids.

FALSE,B+,More Love Songs,Loudon Wainwright III,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8589,"
With regret and trepidation, I'd venture that divorce has been good for his songwriting--after almost a decade of hit-and-miss, this is his second straight to lay down an attitude. The two tracks that tackle the split head-on aren't clever enough for Nashville, which with this clever bastard is a plus. On the other hand, the wit of ""Man's World"" is subsumed by its antifeminist rancor, so that after ""Unhappy Anniversary"" side two rides on attitude alone.

FALSE,B+,Therapy,Loudon Wainwright III,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2131,"
He makes fun of it, and why not, but it's been good for him--the only time he revels in what a mean bastard he is you'd think he was describing somebody else. Not only has shrinkage sharpened his instinct for love's twists, it's gotten him musing about his great subject, parenthood. In ""Thanksgiving"" he rankles and dreams, in ""Me and All the Other Mothers"" he braves the playground, and in ""My Father's Car"" he's insecure about his dad, his mom, his kids, an ex-wife, and the state inside of 2:21.

His 1993 Career Moves did the live folkie best-of as right as it's ever been done. A decade on he's more half-assed--men's-lib lite from History, redundant third ""Westchester County,"" nothing off 2001's Last Man on Earth because his label changed (again). But with a couple of exceptions the songs were strong to start and improve in context, and there are five (out of 17) new ones--every one a winner, three played for laughs if you count ""Something for Nothing,"" which is about file-sharing. Know what? The old fart's against it, although he's too sarcastic to come out and say so straight. Know what else? He may convince you. This is a man who's been making mincemeat out of hippie muscleheads since Timothy Leary was a visionary.

Since he's also a mind-boggling original, however, next-big-thingers are sure to fib about the pleasures of his debut. He can write, and he'll write better; his voice has no obvious precedents, and he'll learn to define it. But for the nonce what he has to offer depends mostly on his piano, played to suggest amateur lieder or the accompaniment at rehearsals of Oklahoma!, and the compositional gift of a melodist whose songs seldom snap shut on a sure-shot refrain and incur no discernible debt to blues materials. Especially as embellished by Van Dyke Parks, whose nutball Americana has been waiting for Wainwright since Brian Wilson vacated the premises, his talent is too big to let pass. And if that doesn't make his hyperromanticism easier to take, there's no point being narrow-minded. Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle it ain't. But a hell of a lot more actualized than Loudon Wainwright III.

FALSE,B+,Wasn't Tomorrow Wonderful?,The Waitresses,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3907,"
You know what kind of waitress Patty Donahue is--the kind who's waiting to break into the arts. A little scatterbrained, maybe, but she can use ""alarmist"" and ""plotted"" in declarative sentences. Not only is she believable, she's full of insight--only the Springsteenian ""Heat Night"" fails completely, and to make up there's the anti-Springsteenian ""It's My Car."" But only ""No Guilt"" is the tour de force that any man who sets out to create feminist rock and roll had better go for every time out, which may be because Chris Butler never asked all those women he interviewed what kind of music they liked.
"
FALSE,B+,Bruiseology,The Waitresses,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3908,"
Instead of cutting back on verbiage, Chris Butler solves his clutter problem by revving the music up so high it blares over its own complexity. The result isn't something you'll listen to all the time, but for most of us the same can be said to Ornette Coleman and the Sex Pistols. And if Butler's thematic concerns aren't universal enough to merit such heady company, his grasp of specifics won't be denied.
"
FALSE,B+,Closing Time,Tom Waits,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8075,"
Waits has been around--one of the two songs that make this album is about driving home at dawn in a '55 Chevy, the other about contacting a girlfriend of forty years before. With his jazz-schooled piano and drawling delivery, he resembles Randy Newman more than such fellow inmates as Jackson Browne and David Blue--Newman feigns feelings for the purpose of mocking them, while Waits exploits an honest sentimentality which he undercuts just enough to be credible. He doesn't carry a tune as well as Newman, though, which gets to be an annoyance on side two.
"
FALSE,B+,Rain Dogs,Tom Waits,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3997,"
By pigging out on a nineteen-track LP that goes on for fifty-four minutes without a bad cut, Waits demonstrates how fully he's outgrown the bleary self-indulgences--booze, bathos, beatnikism--that bogged down his '70s. He's in control of his excesses now, and although his backing musicians shift constantly, he's worked out a unique and identifiable lounge-lizard sound that suits his status as the poet of America's non-nine-to-fivers. But the sheer bulk of the thing does get wearing--it never peaks. I wish he'd figured out a way to throw ""Union Square,"" ""Cemetery Polka,"" and ""Clap Hands"" into sharper relief. And realize that those might not even be his high points, or yours.

FALSE,B+,Codona 2,Colin Walcott/Don Cherry/Nana Vasconcelos,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8592,"
I don't trust music with bird noises in it, I don't trust concepts like ""again,"" and I don't trust Oregon sitarist Collin Walcott, composer of the tweety ""Again and Again, Again."" I wonder why Walcott's ""Walking on Eggs"" sounds like an Ornette Coleman tune while ""Drip-Dry,"" credited to Coleman, sounds like Walcott wrote it (sitars will out?). And when I really want recent Don Cherry I'll put on Johnny Dyani's Song for Biko and get Dudu Pukwana at the same time. But side one is the best UNESCO ad you'll ever hear. Starts with percussionist Vasconcelos's ""Que Faser,"" which sustains itself without obvious melody or beat for 7:08, and continues through the traditional African ""Godumaduma,"" a brief, elegant reminder of where Steve Reich learned his shit. And then there's Cherry's ""Malinye,"" where he states an astonishingly lovely theme first on melodica and then on trumpet before allowing the music to break into crowd noises that somehow enrich the mood, which is then picked up by none other than Collin Walcott--who by this time could sell me a used car, not to mention a brand-new day.

Producer-penned songs begin and fancy up each side, which is half the Hightone story--this would be one more piece of moderately sharp spit-and-shuffle blues without that spit-and-polish. The other half is label honchos Bruce Bromberg and Dennis Walker's insistence on artists determined to rise above--like Robert Cray, Ted Hawkins, and JLW, who must have started out emulating both Junior Wells and Buddy Guy and taken it from there.

I'm beginning to find that their slow groove has a winning depth of character--B.B. Dickerson and Papa Dee Allen get as personal on bass and congas as most rock and rollers do on guitar and piano, and their chants often say more than rock's so-called poetry. Nice to have a couple of hits for purposes of identification, too. But their very slow groove, the one that takes over side one with ""That's What Love Will Do,"" makes me think they take the whole idea of Vanilla Fudge too seriously.

Not that their displacements achieve the depth of either artist, of course--that's the point, and the self-deflation is a relief after the hyperconscious waking nightmares of the debut. Won't get them a telethon, but it's worth five minutes on David Letterman, and they no longer sound as if they regard displacement as their own nutty-professor-turned-ubermensch joke on the world.

Muddy isn't the commanding presence he used to be, but despite the three instrumentals his writing puts this album across. ""Love Weapon"" and ""Whiskey Ain't No Good"" are slow ones he thought about, Willie Hammond's ""Garbage Man"" and the high-gear ""Can't Get No Grindin'"" classic shuffles. Come to think of it, one of the instrumentals is a classic shuffle too--you almost forgive him for putting ""Dust My Broom"" through an electric piano and calling it ""Funky Butt.""

Live Muddys are flooding the market on multiple labels, with differences in quality slighter than they want you to know, but real nonetheless. What makes this well-recorded two-venue combo the choicest has more to do with sound, repertoire, and intangibles of commitment than with changing casts of axeslingers and harmonicats--the big man's basic slide is always what stands out in his bands anyway. Here he is in 1970, reasserting his distance from the just-deceased Leonard Chess's rock dreams--an old-fashioned artist returning to his legendary strengths. By Pablo's 1972 Paris disc he's gotten just slightly complacent; by Just a Memory's 1977 Montreal gig, which has better but more familiar songs, he's relaxed into a seigneurial blues entertainer. Here he still has something to prove--or find out.

Watson has been perfecting his own brand of easy-listening funk for years, and this time he's finally gone into the studio with his guitar Freddie and his drummer Emry and a bunch of electric keyboards and come up with a whole album of good stuff. The riff-based tracks go on too long but go down easy and the lyrics have an edge. Granted, Watson can't match George Benson's chops, but this is dance music, chops would just get in the way. And I prefer his Lou-Rawls-without-pipes to Benson's Stevie-Wonder-ditto.

Two big improvements for this very French packager of ear cinema. One: His movie-sample ""content"" is very much l'art pour l'art, often referencing the tools and tactics of his craft.

Those who find ""It's Raining Men"" suspiciously campy will be doubly offended to hear producer-songwriter Paul Jabara steer his reformed gospel singers into praise of the Anvil and edible men. Me, I think it's the ultimate gay disco song, four hefty-voiced black female survivors set loose on what is much more a gay than a female fantasy, and I love it--for its humor and for its uncompromising extravagance, from lyric to singing to orchestration to arrangement to beat. I tolerate the crass moments on this second long-playing contextualization because five of its six cuts make me laugh.

The live double their more bemused admirers have waited for years is indeed Weather Report's most (if not first) useful album. But it also defines their limits. This is a band that runs the gamut from the catchy to the mysterioso. Joe Zawinul is the best sound effects man since Shadow Morton. And when he gives himself room, Wayne Shorter can blow.

FALSE,B+,Best of the Vanguard Years,The Weavers,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15680,"
The Weavers brought Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly to the agora. They're where Jimmie Rodgers II learned ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine,"" where the Tokens learned ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"" where Peter, Paul &amp; Mary learned ""If I Had a Hammer,"" where the Sandpipers learned ""Guantanamera,"" where the Beach Boys learned ""Sloop John B."" True, Tennessee Ernie Ford didn't need them for ""Sixteen Tons"" nor Lonnie Donegan for ""Rock Island Line""; true, p.c. sentimentality was their stock in trade; true, female principle Ronnie Gilbert had heard too much Odetta and designated guitarist Fred Hellerman had heard too much Theodore Bikel. But Gilbert was a vital force anyway, and Arkansas bass man Lee Hays was as charismatic as Pete Seeger himself when they let him out. The Weavers' Vanguard years followed their icky pop run with Gordon Jenkins at Decca. Their radio viability kaput courtesy of Joe McCarthy, they made their living on a folk circuit they created, and their recordings from the period reflect that enforced simplicity to the songs' benefit. In deep hindsight, I find their re-recorded greatest hits no less energetic and enjoyable than the Byrds'. Starting but not ending with Seeger, they had something.

Webster's legend has never connected on record, and by coming down heavy on the soul standards retro-rocking blues fans yammer for, her much-praised label debut The Swamp Boogie Queen sold her short. Boogie as in woogie, not as in bar band, is her gift--a rolling piano style she certainly didn't invent and just as certainly owns--and here the experts get it down. The quintessential tough-talking woman with sexual needs and a heart of gold.

Like most know-nothings--""Knowledge is power/Got your books, go read 'em""--he equates freedom with individualism and wisdom with unbridled sentiment. But the Replacements were a monument to bad faith by the end, and being as it's time for him to shit or get off the pot, he shits. ""Things,"" to a woman who deserves better than the guy who wrote this song, will tempt you to forgive the songpoems about junkyard flowers and runaway winds. ""Down Love"" and ""A Few Minutes of Silence"" are new ways to say shut up. You'll want to hear that riff again--that one too. Because his official solo debut is considerably more raucous than Don't Tell a Soul or All Shook Down.

The moribund big man having bolted for CBS with the abysmal ""I Love to Sing the Songs I Sing,"" the moribund minor has no recourse but to piece together a best-of. Which is of course the best album released under the big man's name since his last best-of for the minor. He doesn't rap enough, but at least he doesn't essay any true ballads--the tag line masquerading as a ballad he damn near invented, and he's surprisingly OK on the Hollywood-Latin of ""Sha La La Means I Love You"" and the uptempo masculinity of ""I'm Qualified to Satisfy You."" Sha la la means anything you want it to mean.

Seven songs and four stories, and without question the stories have more bite. If topics like crying when your son leaves for college and coping with your father's prostate cancer seem mawkish by definition, God help ""Marlene,"" home from the hospice and dancing with her son in the backyard, or ""A Little More Love,"" White's prescription for everything this side of prostate cancer. I mean, ""Like a Friend"" makes me gag, and I'm a fan. On the other hand, the belief that stories about crying when your son leaves for college are mawkish by definition is a social disease. Those ready to combat it should avail themselves of White's humorous-to-hilarious, insightful-to-incisive antidote--cracked tunes, acoustic strum, and all.

Though I really don't believe that Esquerita and the Seeds, say, loom larger in rock history than, say, Gamble &amp; Huff and the Grateful Dead, this time I have to grant dumb-ass obscurantism its due. Whitfield isn't a genuine throwback, but he is a genuine historical oddity--an acceptable Little Richard substitute, with a band that doesn't fake it. He's not crazed or rubber-piped enough to go all the way with a frantic groove, though ""Mama Get the Hammer"" and ""Ship Sails at Six"" come close. But when everybody lets up a little, especially on semi-instrumentals like ""Walking With Barrence"" and ""Cotton Pickin'"" and the steady-spreading ""Go Ahead and Burn,"" Art Rupe would be proud. Time for thirteen tunes: an authentic 27:52.

No other r&amp;b copy band has such an in at the chicken shack that transcends all knowing, and not just because they play and sing their asses off on covers remarkable, generic, and recondite enough to get born again as new classics. They're smart enough to play cool as well--so smart that only when the chicken shack disappears (as mysteriously as it has materialized, I'm sure) do you wonder just why they're so hot to spend all their time there.

Whitfield has yet to take a composition credit on three albums whose best originals are indistinguishable from the obscure old backbeat grooves and frantic novelties that are his trademark, but he's the auteur for damn sure--just replaced his entire band, with no trace of shift or slippage beyond the two overextended blues-soul showcases that lift him over the 30-minute mark. These are merely generic because the boss has no special gift for expressive sincerity--not on the order of his gift for backbeat grooves and frantic novelties, here written mostly by his new helpers, and I dare you to pick out the ""real"" one without reading the label.

His best came last, and only those who already love the ingrained sorrow and liquored-up ease of I Wonder Do You Think of Me, which provides the four finest performances on this record, should invest in the glimmers it compiles: the way his brave front breaks through such Nashville formula as the cute longing of ""Miami, My Amy,"" the lust at first sight of ""Ten Feet Away,"" the terse lovewords of ""When You Say Nothing at All."" And in ""Tell Lorrie I Love Her,"" recorded in his living room two years before he died, a voice from beyond the grave tells us he could have sung his best any time the smart boys were ready to package him that way.

This record is more depressing than my dispassionate grade would indicate, not just because from the Who we expect better--do we, really?--but because its runaway fatalism invites dispassion. Peter Townshend has more to say about star-doubt than David Crosby or even John Lennon--he's not only honest but exceptionally inquisitive, and he's got a knack for condensing complex ideas. But despite their aper�����""However Much I Booze"" and ""Dreaming From the Waist"" circle around so obsessively that they end up going nowhere; I don't expect answers from the seeker, but I do expect him to enjoy the questions. No surprise that the two songs that break out of the bind are ""Blue Red and Gray"" (which means satori) and ""Slip Kid"" (about one more imagined teenager).

Every time I concentrate I get off on some new detail in Daltrey's singing or Townshend's lyrics or Entwistle's bass parts--though not in Moon's drumming, and I still don't relate to the synthesizer.

If nothing else, Keith Moon's death seems to have delivered Pete Townshend of his obsession with the band he created--and with his own mortality. His new sex songs are stylish and passionate, the strongest he's written for the Who in a decade. Problem is, his pretty-boy mouthpiece sounds like he's forcing the passion. Which reminds me that sex always has to do with mortality--and that mortality catches up with pretty boys faster than with the rest of us.

They're not just ladies' men, they're the big brothers every B-boy wishes he had. Or so they hope. Autobiographical examples make their stay-in-school and one-love advice more convincing than most, though just to cover all the bases they don't stint with the etiquette tips (""That's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble""). But nowhere are they catchier than on the ""tag team sex"" of ""I'm a Ho"" or more realistic than on ""The Good Part"": ""But I keep going for it and I won't stop/Because I don't believe there is a good part/Because I been searching and lurching and looking real good/Because if there is a good part it ain't in my neighborhood.""

Is a two-CD package that could fit onto one conning consumers, taking on airs, or wallowing in nostalgia for a lost time when songs were songs and double albums were double albums? All three. Yet there's no point denying Jeff Tweedy's achievement as long as you recognize its insularity. His simple melodies, felt vocals, and easy stylistic sweep all evoke a past when roots music came naturally, from bluegrass to the Rolling Stones--a past he preserves by removing it to the privacy of his head and your sound system. There's no dynamism to his music--the rockers are slackers, the hooks essentially atmospheric. Yet as objects of contemplation both have their power and charm.

Though it's possible Jeff Tweedy's wife told him to stop being a pretentious tweet, it's more likely she just told him to stop ignoring her. This doesn't mean he actually was ignoring her, mind you. But too late he figured he'd better make a point of paying attention, which meant no more pretentious tweet (for the time being). On the second-best track here, he does the dishes and mows the lawn even though she's not around to appreciate it. On the best, he admits consumers have the right to think his music means whatever they want it to. Everywhere he stops soundscaping and resumes songwriting.

Williams's exquisite clarity and thrilling range have always slotted her among the perfect angels for me, but there's a lot more to her work with Thom Bell, who finally challenges Burt Bacharach on his own turf, applying strings and woodwinds and amplifiers with a deft economy that textures rather than sweetens. And Williams's lyrics, while never startling, become increasingly personal as her professional confidence grows--she's wrinkling her brow more and her nose less. Dionne Warwick fans: welcome to the '80s.

Why do demos have such a mystique? Aren't they created solely to sell songs? And if Williams's prominence freed him of the need to compromise his expression, didn't it also free him of the need to put the song across at all? I mean, it wasn't evil bizzers who forced him to record with a band--the band was Hank's pride and joy. Listen to the static singsong rhythms of these strummed solo versions and you'll know why--when Vic McAlpin (?) provides a touch of vocal counterpoint on ""You Better Keep It on My Mind,"" it's like somebody just pulled up the shades. Nor are all the obscurities as epochal as the side-openers, ""Honky Tonk Blues"" and ""Jambalaya,"" both available and then some in livelier, more crisply recorded versions. Because Williams was a genius, his alternate takes are certainly of interest, and occasionally--the slow, stark ""A House of Gold,"" for instance--they're riveting. But this is for serious collectors. Casual collectors should put their money into Polydor's complete-recordings twofers before evil bizzers kill the project.

At times his son-of-an-outlaw obsession is worse than shtick, but here he does justice to the formula. Two candid songs about women tell you more about his sexism than he knows himself, two others explain why he's in that mood, the covers from Gregg Allman and George Jones define his parameters, and ""The Conversation""--with Waylon Guess Who, about Guess Who, Sr.--doesn't make you gag once.

Then I read the notes and began to suspect it was because he wasn't having much fun himself. All rock and rollers were in it for the money, but there are degrees, and somehow I think a guy who ended up shooting himself in his Laurel Canyon mansion after 25 years of pimping and pushing might have had trouble getting into the spirit of skillfully concocted sillyditties like ""Bony Moronie"" and ""Peaches and Cream,"" or ignoring the subtext of ""Little School Girl.""

Unfortunately, there aren't. Then again, indelible these aren't--too mushy around the edges. Williams has always worked her drawl, but here the extended vowels and slurred consonants tempt one to suspect she's afraid ""We were blessed by the watchmaker/Who gave up his time"" won't stand up straight next to ""We were blessed by the wounded man/Who felt no pain."" Unfortunately, it won't, and similar shortfalls cripple ""Soldier Song"" just before. What makes me half believe I'll want to hear this album again is the drawn-out religious rumination ""Awakening,"" where vagueness signifies, and every solo Val McCallum gets. Atmospheric. Play loud anyway, so it won't be.

FALSE,B+,Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone,Lucinda Williams,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16199,"
You'll never guess--a double album that would be punchier as a single! It doesn't help that the 20 tracks average over five minutes apiece, so that the philosophical grist of ""Temporary Nature (of Any Precious Thing),"" for instance, leaches what value its no-love-without-loss wheeze has as the song refuses to end. My strategy, which I've made a reality in my iTunes folder, is to finish off the top five of disc one with--somewhat less sure-shottedly--the bottom four of disc two. The political to the personal. Nine-minute cover to wander out on. Title: Down to the Bone.

FALSE,B+,Turn It Over,The Tony Williams Lifetime,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4016,"
I'm being complimentary when I say that though Led Zeppelin II is infinitely more cumbrous and stupid it packs the same sheer clamoring rock presence. Of course, drummer John Bonham insists on breaking the mood with a solo, while drummer Williams improvises continually on a steadier beat than is ordinarily acceptable among jazz devotees--when he, Larry Young, John McLaughlin, and Jack Bruce all play together it's impossible to distinguish front and back or melody and rhythm. ""Right On,"" two orgasmic minutes of raveup energy and master chops, almost makes me believe in his quavering, enigmatic vocal lines. Unfortunately, though, it doesn't make me want to listen to them, perhaps because he uses his voice to pronounce words.

FALSE,B+,Happy Come Home,Victoria Williams,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4120,"
Sui generis it may be, yet in a great semipopular tradition: oddball folkie meets El Lay, represented by her coproducers born-again Steven Soles and bicoastal Anton Fier, as well as venerable oddball Van Dyke Parks, whose string arrangements prove him her soul brother. Her roots are in Cajunland, so naturally she sings like a cross between Dolly Parton and Yoko Ono. If you fear art damage, I cannot tell a lie, so maybe you'll believe me when I add that it's tolerable. Shoes, Jesus, merry-go-rounds, and animals--lots of animals. Hirth Martinez would be proud.

FALSE,B+,Bang Bang,Kelly Willis,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1910,"
Up till the Joe Ely conceit she goes out on, this 22-year-old doesn't get a single lyric worthy of her lusty-voiced appetite for decent love. She claims she'll wrap her pipes around any original her drummer husband hands her, but since the five on the debut are down to two here, there's reason to hope that next time her Nashville handlers will put her in touch with an actual female songwriter. Would Lucinda Williams be asking too much?

FALSE,B+,Kelly Willis,Kelly Willis,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1911,"
Willis loves singing like George Jones loves singing, like Rosanne Cash loves singing, and once a fella notices how hard she tries and how strong she feels, he'll want to hug and kiss her till that smile is back on her pretty little face. But though the tunes are her solidest yet, Don Was's Billy Bremner guitar and Jellyfish harmonies don't set them off any more clearly than Tony Brown's neoclassical taste did. That's mostly because Willis's idea of a good lyric is a simple lyric. No wordplay, no narrative, no trenchant details--just the musical statement, alive and direct. OK, honey, if you say so. But I still think maybe you should join that T-group with K.T. and Mary-Chapin.

Recorded under Wills's supervision until he suffered a stroke before the last day's sessions, this double-LP doesn't represent the band at its peak. But though earlier recordings of most of these classic tunes are at least marginally sharper, it certainly captures the relaxed, playful, eclectic Western swing groove that Wills invited in the '30s. And Merle Haggard does sing lead on three cuts.

Can it be that Joe McEwen, the candidate for sainthood who almost single-handedly resurrected Wilson from the vaults, actually likes his big-ballad mode? Why else unearth his album-only ""Georgia On My Mind""? Why not pretend that ""Alone at Last""--which reached 8 pop and only 20 r&amp;b--never existed? And what about the obsequious if pyrotechnic Copa medley? Not that any of this stuff is without interest, or that the album-only ballad ""I've Got To Get Back"" isn't a jewel. Still, I wonder.

FALSE,B+,The Soul Years,Jackie Wilson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11477,"
What strikes you first about this post-1967 material is that new black producer Carl Davis has graced it with a groove, often a fairly mellow one. And for half the album Wilson sails along on top, relaxed and confident and supremely attractive. But as the hits get scarcer the arrangements get busier and Wilson starts emoting harder. Which does him no good.

FALSE,B+,New Beginnings,Larry Jon Wilson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8129,"
A sleeper from a previously unrecorded Georgian who looks to be around forty. Capsule portrait: he named his crippled son after his father, a dirt farmer who moved to the city with misgivings, and Bertrand Russell, both of whom he ""knew and loved."" The record is as original as you might hope, catchy and fresh-sounding despite overlays of schlock intended to hook the country audience. I wish I could say it was promising as well, but I suspect not. The drawback to rediscovering home truths, which is definitely Wilson's calling, is that when the excitement fades--and even a modest career takes its toll--the reaffirmations turn back into platitudes. That has already begun to happen on the weak cuts here.

From Bayside and/or Florida, they traveled south and/or north to record with the ubiquitous but stationary Mitch Easter, who never before has gotten so close to this kind of dense intensity--the extra drumbeats, the guitars that fall apart and then right themselves, the aggressive timing. It suffers the usual limitations of homage and formal exercise--you never really notice what the songs are about even though it's part of the game to write smart lyrics and sing medium clear. But especially on ""Delaware 89763,"" which sounds like it could have been recorded at the Star Club long about 1966, they make you hear Carolina Beatlism for the romantic fantasy it is--from the Beatlemania-manqu������������������ of the Spong"

With Bobby Sutliffe off following his muse like some junior Chris Stamey, Tim Lee remains as Peter Holsapple--sinewy soul, sandpaper cry, iron pyrite hooks, the works. No way is he as clever, but he compensates with an urgency that's his version of sound and groove both, and if a few of these jangle no-fail melodies went deeper than love hurts, he'd deserve better than he's likely to get.

FALSE,B+,Venus and Mars,Wings,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8136,"
Superficially, which counts for a lot with McCartney, his New Orleans venture is his most appealing post-Beatles album--straight rock and roll with a few pop detours and one excursion into ""When I'm 64"" nostalgia. So clear in its melodies, mix, and basic pulse that his whimsical juxtapositions--robots on Main Street, Rudy Vallee cheek by jowl with Allen Toussaint--sound like they might make some sense. Don't get me wrong--they probably don't, because McCartney's a convinced fool. But when the music is coherent it doesn't matter so much.

FALSE,B+,Wings Greatest,Wings,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8139,"
Twelve songs, five of them hits not on any previous Wings album, running 54:11 in all, replete with rhythm shifts and subthemes and counterplots and flights of fancy and forays into abject nonsense. In short, pop for potheads. All I could ask is a stylus-width scratch across ""My Love.""

FALSE,B+,Johnny Winter And,Johnny Winter,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8145,"
Ex-popstar Rick Derringer represents the North--real McCoy rock guitar, contentless AM songs, dumb vocals (watch out Steve Miller here comes Dino Valenti). Ex-bluesman Winter represents the South--spacey ex-blues guitar, formless FM songs, exalted vocals (and you thought spacey ex-blues was an insult). Result: best metal since Layla.

FALSE,B+,Still Alive and Well,Johnny Winter,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8147,"
Winter will never be an especially personable singer, but I like what's he's putting out on this monkey-off-my-comeback: two late-Stones covers, plenty of slide, and a good helping of nasty. Nastiest: the Delta-styled ""Too Much Seconal"" and ""Ain't Nothing to Me,"" dedicated to the subversive notion that sometimes the impassivity of country music is a little sadistic. White blues lives: the best and heaviest track is a Hoodoo Rhythm Devils song.

FALSE,B+,Icarus,Paul Winter Consort,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11491,"
Kind of a classical/jazz mix but with none of the stiffness that suggests--inquisitive, contemplative, eclectic, peaceful. And eloquent, much more eloquent than my description, which does more for the music than the lyrics that obstruct a couple of cuts.

FALSE,B+,Is This Real?,The Wipers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8152,"
Three guys from Portland (Oregon, but it might just as well be Maine) who caught on to punk unfashionably late and for that reason sound like they're still discovering something. Which hardly makes them unique--there are similar bands in dozens if not hundreds of American cities, many of whom send me records. What distinguishes this one is Greg Sage's hard-edged vocals--detached but never silly, passionate but never overwrought--and economical one-hook construction.

""`A Serious of Snakes'"" is 154 updated technologically, rhythmically, and spiritually, which is almost to say transformed utterly--dance-trance with a nasty surrealistic edge. ""Drill"" does the same for Pink Flag. ""Advantage in Height"" is less of both worlds. ""Up to the Sun"" is a cappella noodling. Welcome back.

Waiting for my annoyance to articulate itself, I found appropriate contexts--subways, elevators, etc.--and stuck this into my personal portable. Where to my shock it proved fun fun fun. Maybe they are about to jump to Windham Hill, but only because Windham Hill wants to escape its suburban demographic. Mellifluous, deceitful background rock--but ugly, and with a kick.

FALSE,B+,Behind the Curtain,Wire,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4201,"
For Pink Flag as opposed to Wire cultists, and of course there's a difference. We prefer them at their punkest, fastest, and shortest, as with the many titles on this 1977-78 outtakes comp that didn't make any of their first three albums or the On Returning best-of, all 17 of which fit easily on one side of a C-60. These include the five live songs not on Roxy London WC2--""Mary Is a Dyke""! ""New York City""! ""After Midnight""! (Eric Clapton's!)--as well as preliminary settings for riffs that will resurface in other guises. The other 14 tracks are punker, faster, shorter, louder, and/or rougher versions of songs Wire cultists have never forgotten and never mind hearing again.

Deprived of Bruce Gilbert's guitar, these fractious lifers return to and improve on their dance-rock '80s. From the scene-setting new-wavey relationship-gone-sour of ""One of Us"" to the climactic electropunk historo-fatalism of ""All Fours,"" though not always in between, they remind you why they were a great band. But they should know better than to dis the Mekons, who still are a great band when the time seems right.

Most of side two sounds like Roberta Flack, which disappoints me even though it probably doesn't surprise anyone else, Withers included. Well, I had my hopes for this man, but then, so did all the Roberta Flack fans, every one of whom must love ""Lean on Me."" Side one, I'm happy to report, begins with a nasty song to a trendy fox who wants Bill to see a shrink! Keep it up, Bill! and he does! Pretty much. For one side. Recommended, but barely.

Though the big deal is supposed to be the way collaborator Michael Jonzun brings Wolf's r&amp;b into the space age, there's more electronic pizzazz in current Chaka or Ashford &amp; Simpson. Such sweet sleepers as ""I Need You Tonight"" and ""Baby Please Don't Go"" and ""Here Comes That Hurt Again,"" all of them originals, sound like obscure Motown covers. In short, a gratifyingly unassuming solo breakaway.

Just how low-profile the new songs are is made clear when a sweet cover of ""Here Comes the Sun"" snaps you from drugged semiconscious enjoyment to full attention. I love the relaxed groove and wavering back-porch harmonies that go into their unique sound--lazy, tender, patient, long-suffering, tired of fighting. But they don't have to get by on atmosphere.

FALSE,B+,"Signed, Sealed and Delivered",Stevie Wonder,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8160,"
Sometime in the past (can it be?) eight years, Little Stevie became Big, and so did his frantic one-smash-a-year style--wheezes, shrieks, and all. Consistent Motown albums are rare, and Wonder is still an immature ballad singer, though at least now he's covering ""We Can Work It Out"" (some ballad) rather than (I'm not making this up) ""The Shadow of Your Smile."" All the good stuff here is stuffed onto one great side--the most exciting music by a male soul singer in quite some time, and it fits no mold, Motown's included.
"
FALSE,B+,Where I'm Coming From,Stevie Wonder,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8161,"
Wonder produced and (with his wife, Syreeta Wright) scripted this escape from Berry Gordy's plantation, and as you might expect it's not entirely successful. Unlike his corporate masters, though, Wonder prefers sins of commission--he's always out on a limb, and if that means ""classical"" flutes and images like ""ride the thorny mule"" it also means the zany, stuttering autobacktalk of ""I Wanna Talk to You"" and the possible Sammy Davis cover ""Take Up a Course in Happiness,"" not to mention the most expressive synthesizers yet recorded. And unlike the manumitted Marvin Gaye, Wonder never sounds like a simp--the sentiments may be stale, but their textures are fresh.

FALSE,B+,Music of My Mind,Stevie Wonder,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3352,"
Making the most of the inevitable, Motown boasts on the back cover that ""this album is virtually the work of one man""--he plays everything but one solo each on guitar and trombone. Sure could teach John Fogerty a thing or two about multitracked spontaneity--this music is mercurial above all else. Just like the blind genius he's always compared to, Wonder transcends taste. But because the specifics are less inspired than the gestalt--which is not to say I don't love ""Love Having You Around"" and catch myself enjoying the regrettable ""Superwoman""--it doesn't quite hold together.

FALSE,B+,In Square Circle,Stevie Wonder,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8650,"
Compare this to the others in your head and you'll be hard-pressed to specify what's missing, but slap on Talking Book or Hotter Than July and you'll hear how cushy it is--polyrhythmic pop rather than polyrhythmic rock. Stevie's effervescence is so indomitable that it's a pleasure even so, but nothing rises far enough out of the stew--""Land of the La La"" is no ""Living for the City,"" ""Part Time Lover,"" no ""I Just Called to Say I Love You,"" etc. Then there's the infectious ""Spiritual Walkers,"" in which Stevie gives it up to Hare Krishna and witnesses for the Witnesses.

Problem with this budget eight-song early-singles compilation is that at close to thirty-four minutes there isn't quite enough of it. The fast-faster-fastest sequence that leads into the slow, surprising obloquy on side one is excitement itself but doesn't put the anticlimactic Suicide homage across; ""Special Friend"" shoulda stayed a B side, and ""Cold Inside"" a dub remix. And given how often youth comes to full bloom these days, this is the Woodentops to buy nevertheless.

FALSE,B+,Big Smash,Wreckless Eric,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8655,"
A strange sort of double album, half of it the compilation indie Stiff stiffed with last year, the other a supposed commercialization. The theme is ""Pop Song,"" which begins with a murmured ""Put it in your mouth"" before moving on to ""Better write a pop record/With a money-spinning hook/If the muse don't hit you/You're off the books."" 'Tis said the spunk has gone out of the lad, but though he does wax lyrical at times--I like the one where he admires the style of a girl handing in her tube ticket--he's as rude and scrawny as ever. Maybe the new stuff isn't altogether fabulous, but Stiff led with a compilation because he's mortal. If you count yourself among the millions who didn't purchase The Wonderful World of Wreckless Eric, do so now--you'll hardly notice the pop songs' rough sheen. If you count yourself among the thousands who did, ask yourself how much you love him and act accordingly. I love him moderately myself. Grade for new disc only.

You'd never guess it from ""Clean Up Woman,"" but this album is the perfect union of the Betty who has worked in the Alston studio since 1964 and the Betty who won't be nineteen until September 21--teen love in all its moral passion and sweet concupiscence. Does her voice shoot upwards on ""I'll Love You Forever Heart and Soul"" because her spirit is soaring or because he just touched between her legs? Both, I hope.

I underrated this EP five years ago because, having never seen the band play, I had no inkling of how much I'd end up valuing their live recordings--how much I'd love hearing two perfectly unmatched voices interact in the moment. The up-front redundancy of the title cut is now extended by the reappearance of the live ""Rigor Mortis"" and the formerly EP-only ""Blood and Guts"" on the free Berneice Huff mixtape. That said, I always thought the vibraphone-bedizened ""Skip"" was the choicest EP-only here, ""Sweetie"" squeaks and whooshes as it rocks out, ""Millie Christine"" adds a raw declarativeness one of their milder numbers thrives on, and ""Airborne"" is the finest version of their finest song, which leads their first and finest album. But of course, they're all worth owning. As is this.

FALSE,B+,"Berneice Huff and Son, Bill, Sings . . . Popular Favorites",Wussy,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15899,"
I claim no objectivity about this wittingly ramshackle collection of remixes, demos, live versions, covers, and ancient interview snippets except as regards the number of times I've chosen to put it on at bedtime or breakfast--partly because my wife is as big a fan as I am, but partly because I knew by play two that what nonfans might consider its self-indulgences would never obtrude. The excellent new songs are all southern Ohio covers, two from their allies in the Afghan Whigs and one from someone named Jenny Mae. But if you believe that Lisa Walker may be the finest female singer working today, and that this band has never written a song you'll mind hearing again, then alternate versions are just a way to reaccess her vocal invention and their collective touch. Even the 2:33 worth of snippets fit in--Chuck and Mark are funny guys. Available gratis, of course, to anyone who likes 'em enough to visit their website.

I'm at a loss to describe this album of ""drones and songs"" conceived and recorded after Wyatt's crippling accident except to say that the keyboards that dominate instrumentally are of a piece with his lovely tortured-to-vulnerable quaver and that the mood is that of a paraplegic with the spirit to conceive and record an album of drones and songs.

In which the CPUK turns the unwary art-rocker into Pete Seeger. Long convinced that there's no percentage in soft-soaping the masses, Wyatt is more candidly propagandistic than, say, the Weavers--no ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine"" (the Raincoats would never speak to him again), two tracks praising Stalin Foiler-of-the-Fascist-Foe. And his modernized concept of the folk enables him to transform a Chic song into a hymn. But internationalist sentiment still prevails--from Bangladeshi folk-rock to a stirring ""Guantanamera""--and so does the shameless lust for killer melodies. In fact, if Wyatt had a freak voice as universal as Pete Seeger's he might move the left-wing masses quite nicely.

Nothing like d-i-v-o-r-c-e to bring out the independent woman in you--the only marital-commitment song here is about having an alcoholic husband. And where in her domestic-paragon phase she was beginning to sound prim, here she ranges from forthright to positively hot, torching up her tales of star-crossed sex as if she's just learned how to masturbate. Point of interest: Billy Sherrill's latest collaborator on Tammy's material is George Richey, Tammy's latest husband.

Her mackstress bona fides are predictably generic despite the gender-bent pimp routine, and even after she progresses to the womanisms that dominate the second half of a typically excessive 80-minute No Limit disc, she can't very well avoid cliches: adoring her kids, mourning her G, fending off her current knucklehead, she's role-playing straight up. But especially after she expresses her love for a dead homegirl, her declarations of leather-skinned cynicism and wit's-end vulnerability take on a retrospective weight that counterbalances their surface contradictions. A ghetto story, real as fiction.

Although it took a year and a half for this debut album by the premier English art-pop band to get released in the States, two Andy Partridge songs on side one aim directly at the American market--""Radios in Motion,"" which mentions Milwaukee, surely isn't about the BBC, and the avowed purpose of ""Statute of Liberty"" is to get a look up her skirts. The third, ""This Is Pop,"" is why he missed--radio programmers resent anyone telling them their business, especially subversives who favor herky-jerk rhythms, jerky-herk harmonies, Lene Lovich radar noises, and depressing subject matter. Colin Moulding's songs, on the other hand, are aimed at bored Yes fans, which is why he missed--the lad doesn't know that Yes fans like being bored.

With voices (filters, chants, wimp cool) and melodies (chants, modes, arts cool) ever more abstract, I figured Colin Moulding had finally conquered Andy Partridge and turned this putative pop band into Yes for the '80s. But it's more like good Argent, really, with the idealism less philosophical than political--melt the guns, urban renewal as bondage, o! that generation gap. And fortunately, the melodies aren't so much abstract as reserved, with the most outgoing stolen from Vivaldi or somebody by none other than Andy Partridge.

With help from that bad corporate money, they get a striking sound out of the no-bass thing. It's both big and punk, never a natural combo, and up against the Kills it's killer--Nick Zinner commands more than any man's allotted portion of dangerous riffs. But to care about this band you have to find Karen O's fuck-me persona provocative if not seductive, and since I've never been one for the sex-is-combat thing, I find it silly or obnoxious depending on who's taking it seriously. Duly noted: two human-scale songs toward the end.

FALSE,B+,Fragrant World,Yeasayer,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15767,"
Most of the time you can half make out the lyrics and then occasionally parse them too--whaddaya know, ""Reagan's Skeleton"" is about the election, sort of, and neither ""Longevity"" nor ""Henrietta"" would mind if it died before it got old or reached 100, whichever came second. But I only made sense of this album when I decided to enjoy its sonic trickerations the way I do African music in which the verbal sentiments might compromise my pleasure if I knew what they were. It's not a groove record, that's for sure, but it has some bump and even funk to it, a dark density years away from the evolved Depeche Mode of the proudly proggy Odd Blood. And almost every track offers up at least a snatch of melody you're always glad to hear again.

FALSE,B+,Live at Reggae Sunsplash,Yellowman,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10305,"
If Big Youth is the dread George Jessel, then the albino orphan who's supplanted him as JA's premier toaster is something altogether more waggish and blue, an unwitting amalgam of Eddie Cantor, Mae West, and Pigmeat Markham. Though groovemasters follow wherever he goes, his albums tend to run together because music isn't really the point, and neither is political or spiritual uplift. The point is entertainment, and live he concentrates on his best material, blued up a bit to give the crowd something extra for its money. Encore: ""Sit Under Me.""

FALSE,B+,Buenas Noches From a Lonely Room,Dwight Yoakam,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1106,"
With the clout to take chances, Yoakam is out to prove that he's one mean cocksucker. On side one, hopeless jealousy metastasizes into a killing rage, and for damn sure he's more interesting that way--Jerry Lee worshippers may even get hard. Side two's Buck Owens cameo and lament for a boozer dad convince me the revamped persona is for the better. The inspirational number he wrote for his mom convinces me of nothing.
"
FALSE,B+,And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out,Yo La Tengo,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4249,"
The main problem with this background tour de force is that you understand not just how good it is but how pretty it is only when you listen up. The whispered guitar and pattering drum patterns, the unattainable sounds, the details of a modest love for the ages--all mean what they mean in part because they're so quiet. Yet if you don't get it, all I can advise is: Play Loud.
"
FALSE,B+,Testarossa,Yoni & Geti,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16881,"
The fruit of a European tour by David Cohn d/b/a Serengeti and his beatmaker pal Yoni Wolf is goofy and fanciful in Geti's signature manner. It's quite slight, quite tuneful, quite funny--""Met a woman named Ella/Used to be a fella,"" or the long list of imaginary social-media sites like ListenUp, WhereYaAt, Lick4Lick, Gwaffalo, and GrindStone. But everywhere you can feel his marriage tugging at touring's frayed tether. At long last he returns home to his daughter's new bangs, his son's homework folder, and the computer he just bought his wife. But happy about it he cannot be. ""This is just my tenderness/My wretchedness/I'm a pessimist,"" he mutters--and also, as he's mentioned before, a poltergeist: an invisible disruptor. Slight or not, if you've come to care about the guy it's pretty sad.

FALSE,B+,"One Love, One Heart",Yabby You,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4233,"
Like many a serenely anonymous Rastafarian tuneweaver, the former Vivian Jackson could almost be a muezzin (or three) chanting nursery rhymes, most of which concern the end of the world as we know it, a prospect which cheers him considerably. With the help of many justly famous Rastafarian session-men he's produced a typical reggae sleeper--no surprises (the end of the world is hardly news), but considerable cheer.

FALSE,B+,Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,Neil Young,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10849,"
Young is a strange artist and I am not all the way into him yet, but this record is haunting. For someone who is into him, try to find the piece Greil Marcus wrote for Good Times (reprinted in the July 23 EVO). Best rock criticism in a while.
"
FALSE,B+,Harvest,Neil Young,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2513,"
Anticipation and mindless instant acceptance made for critical overreaction when this came out, but it stands as proof that the genteel Young has his charms, just like the sloppy one. Rhythmically it's a little wooden, and Young is guilty of self-imitation on ""Alabama"" and pomposity on on the unbearable London Symphony Orchestra opus ""There's a World."" But those two excepted, even the slightest songs here are gratifying musically, and two of them are major indeed--""The Needle and the Damage Done"" and the much-maligned (by feminists as well as those critics of the London Symphony Orchestra) ""A Man Needs a Maid.""
"
FALSE,B+,American Stars 'n Bars,Neil Young,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2519,"
The first side, recently recorded, is Young's rough-and-tough version of L.A. country rock, featuring a female backup duo called the Bullets and climaxing with ""Bite the Bullet,"" his sharpest cut since ""Tonight's the Night."" The second is a journey through the past that perhaps should have stayed in the outtake can. On one tune, Neil turns into a salmon while masturbating in front of the fireplace; on another, he and Crazy Horse somehow take the wind out of ""Like a Hurricane,"" which blew everybody away at the Palladium last fall.

FALSE,B+,Eldorado,Neil Young,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2529,"
This is certain to become a legend on rarity alone, and if you believe mad guitar is all he's good for, you may even think it's worth a buck a minute at the $25 it cost me. I think it's versions and/or work tapes, with two otherwise unavailable songs and mad guitar that ends too soon. I'm glad to own it. But I get reimbursed.
"
FALSE,B+,"Road Rock, Vol. 1",Neil Young,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2540,"
Only one of the six 1969-1978 oldies that dominate this contract-conscious holding action is on any previous live album--""Tonight's the Night,"" which admittedly had more get-up-and-go on Weld in 1990. The two new titles are a girl-group hoot too good for Silver and Gold and a bitter, climactic, Chrissie Hynde-enhanced ""All Along the Watchtower."" The Keith-Oldham-Dunn-Keltner band rocks different than Crazy Horse. Definitely not dead yet.
"
FALSE,B+,Living With War,Neil Young,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13305,"
OK, more news event than musical milestone. But a really great news event--believe me, the '60s never produced an album that felt this much like a peace march. The key is the sense of fellowship, with music carried less by the artist's broad guitar and creaky voice than by loud drums, what-the? horn arrangements, and a hundred-person chorus on every song. The second consecutive Neil Young album where you know what all the words mean (following 50-odd where you didn't) specifies that this radical-of-the-moment is not averse to supporting a repentant Colin Powell. This proves him a populist if anything does.

FALSE,B+,Year of the Horse,Neil Young & Crazy Horse,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2539,"
Largest word on package: LIVE. A dozen songs, mostly at the usual midtempo stomp, more than half dating to the '70s (or '60s). Also three off last year's barely noticed Broken Arrow--one terrific then too, one improving as it gets (even) longer, one a permanent drag. The climax is Life's long-lost ""Prisoners"" (formerly ""of Rock 'n' Roll""), which climaxes with the deathless ""That's why we don't want to be good."" Men of their word, they're great sometimes and good never. And then the CD version--on Broken Arrow, vinyl was the bonus-cut format--climaxes again with a wilder ""Sedan Delivery"" than the one they thrashed out on Live Rust 18 years ago. Guy never gives up, does he? That's why his completists have more fun.
"
FALSE,B+,No Parlez,Paul Young,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8671,"
Unlike the interpretive singers of an earlier generation, Young projects a concern with emotion rather than emotion itself--an idea or a value rather than a passion. Where Joe Cocker and Maggie Bell played it hot, Young's take on the slightly archaic black singing styles he admires so candidly is cool and synthetic. while this aligns him neatly with urban contemporaries in the Jeffrey Osborne mold and helps him steal away with ""Love Will Tear Us Apart,"" it puts a heavier burden on his powers of analysis than any rock-and-roller should risk. Fortunately, his delight in state-of-the-art production and arrangement, as well as in his own vocal resources, provides the underpinnings of authenticity any second-hand man needs.
"
FALSE,B+,The Secret of Association,Paul Young,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8672,"
His fat voice even more a sign of the times than Laurie Latham's baroque production, Young is Boz Scaggs for the '80s: an honorable soul fake. It's all too much at times, but Young writes as well as Boz ever did and is smart enough to go elsewhere for the meaty lyrics he loves, including two antiwar songs that could make more of an impression than Boy George's. Be nice to think music could still do that sometimes.
"
FALSE,B+,The Men Who Loved Music,Young Fresh Fellows,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4252,"
Bands this funny have to be funnier than they ever are to be as good as bands this smart want to be. Which isn't to say I don't enjoy most of the jokes and treasure several, like ""When the Girls Get Here"" (""We'll talk about integrated circuits and things"") and ""Amy Grant"" (""Barry/Barry White"").
"
FALSE,B+,Stone Cold Rhymin',Young M.C.,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6129,"
From the bright, cute funk of ""I Come Off"" to the Q. Jones Jr.-cowritten ""Just Say No,"" he's just too clean. His polysyllables and quick lips aren't as fresh as he thinks they are, either. Much more than his East Coast counterpart the Fresh Prince, though, he has his own sparely hooky musical style--courtesy Matt Dike, Michael Ross, and the usual panoply of pop-funk geniuses past. Has his own style as a writer, too, summed up pretty well in the title--he's not a storyteller, he's a wordslinger. Fun fun fun until daddy takes the contract away.
"
FALSE,B+,I Came From Nothing 3,Young Thug,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16151,"
The moralist in me scoffs at the rationalization that trap-rap ""street"" tropes are merely conventions--a song called ""Molly Workin'"" has to hook harder than this one to make me forget that molly generates more fellatio providers than normally occur in nature. But the hedonist in me won't deny that gangsters grok pop's Saturday night hustle in a way moralists cannot. The turning point on this freewheeling get-together is the ""birthday bash"" Thug announces midway through on ""I'm Paid,"" after which tracks that were already coming thick and fast pick up speed as the party gets wilder and louder. One skittering synthbeat accelerates off another, ""Angry Sex"" straight on to ""I Like What Ya Doin'."" You want to know Jeffrey Williams's principles? How 'bout ""No homo/We party though/We get gnarly though/We smoke dro/We fuck our hoes/We rock shows/That's what we here fo'""? ""Time of Ya Life,"" that one's called, and given how much time he can count on, it should be.

FALSE,B+,1017 Thug,Young Thug,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16152,"
Midway in, the sonic breakout ""Picachu"" begins a five-out-of-six run interrupted only by a song from a Gucci Mane not yet put safely away--chorus fans may actually prefer the lubricious ""Miss U"" or the sanguinary ""Trigger Finger"" to ""Picachu"" itself. But don't let whatever noxious potion you're vicariously sipping cloud your judgment, because otherwise this is just a quality mixtape. However much you enjoy the bombed recipe for disaster ""2 Cups Stuffed"" or the stoned geography lesson ""Nigeria,"" it's a road to no place special with a lot of signposts on it.

FALSE,B+,Beat It Down,Y Pants,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8674,"
The notion that women's music should be cute has as little theoretical attraction as the notion that it should be organic, and the notion that it should be arty as well has less. But these three Soho gals get away with it, no doubt because at some level deep beneath the ukelele and toy piano they're willing to be ballbusters. The key is a sweet, a cappella version of ""That's the Way Boys Are"" that's, er, marred halfway through by the sound of a woman screaming in the middle distance. Every one of these (ersatz-Andean?) melodies will sneak up on you eventually, and just maybe paste you one.
"
FALSE,B+,Nights Without Sleeping,Chaba Zahouania,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=562,"
Maybe singers dominate rai where Arabic is spoken, but as an export it's producer's music. When Rachid and Fethi electrify conventional Algerian arrangements on the A, Zahouania remains a travelogue novelty for all her lowdown. Second side they go to town--the pulse and timbre and timing and juxtapositions of the indelibly Middle Eastern elements are all arrogantly eclectic in the great rock-disco tradition, only this time these priceless cultural resources are misused, and transfigured, by insiders.
"
FALSE,B+,Zapp II,Zapp,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8676,"
This idly functional, playfully mechanical six-cut dance LP tested my tolerance for innocent mindlessness, especially after I realized that my favorite tune appears on both sides. But unlike its predecessor it is a real dance LP--side one will function your ass off. And you'll want to play ""Playin' Kinda Ruff"" again.

Z������������������ isn't just a great artist. He's an ever-evolving one, an 81-year-old who sings this album with a warmth and verve that does equal justice to his melodic grace and his sing-song hooks.

Written for children 30 years ago, their lyrics apparently add up to an associ""Is that A for amor?"" one wonders, and maybe Portuguese speakers can figure out an answer, although that answer won't strictly speaking be Z������������������'s--the words are by his illustrator friend Elifas Andreato.

I am suspicious of singer-songwriters who draw attention to phrases like ""hasten down the wind,"" and I would suggest a moratorium on songs about the James Brothers that don't also rhyme ""pollution"" and ""solution."" But I like the way Zevon resists pigeonholes like ""country-rock"" while avoiding both the banal and the mystagogical, and I like quatrains like: ""And if California slides into the ocean/Like the mystics and statistics say it will/I predict this motel will be standing/Until I pay my bill.""
"
FALSE,B+,Transverse City,Warren Zevon,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5952,"
With his eye on the fate of the earth, from malls and gridlock to entropy and deorbiting heavenly bodies, Zevon succumbs to the temptations of art-rock. This beats country-rock, at least as he defines it, and given his formal training it was decent of him to wait until his material demanded sci-fi keybs--arpeggios and ostinatos and swirling soundtracks. With Little Feat's Richie Hayward the timekeeper, the stasis is a little heavier than anyone concerned with the fate of the earth would hope, but you don't get the feeling Warren's hopes are high enough to warrant anything livelier. ""Splendid Isolation,"" about solipsism as a life choice, ""Turbulence,"" about perestroika and Afghanistan, and ""Run Straight Down,"" about the fate of the earth on the 11 o'clock news, are exactly as grim as they ought to be.

FALSE,B+,El Loco,ZZ Top,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4275,"
Their boogie's gotten grander again, more nationwide than homegrown, which at its best--the euphemistically misprised ""Tube Snake Boogie"" (and did you know ""Pearl Necklace"" is Southwestern for blow job?)--means only that it packs a more powerful kick. That they're eccentric nonetheless is proven not just by the harmonizer-processed voice of evil shaking the DT's while working street PR, but by the brown-eyed mama who guards their groovy little hippie pad with .44, jeep, and German shepherd. The easy life ain't what it used to be.

FALSE,B+,Eliminator,ZZ Top,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4276,"
Arena-rockers who never forgot heavy metal was once white blues, they took a long vacation and resurfaced as a fine white blues band starring a guitarist who always sounds like himself. Now, with hitest b.p.m.s speeding the groove, they've motorvated back toward metal again--boogie in overdrive, a funny car that's half platinum and half plutonium. The videos make you smile, the record runs you over. That's the pleasure of it.

The look of the Mark I ABC fooled Anglophobes into dismissing the music as fashion-plated pandering even though it was as politically suggestive as Anglophile heroes get. So don't let the look of the Mark II ABC fool you into hoping the music is outrageous, or even campy. Sure ""Be Near Me"" is catchier than anything on Beauty Stab, but when Martin Fry is on his game the hooks that make ABC sell coexist with the glossy electrofunk and dense wordplay that make (or made) them sparkle.

Replacing Aerosmith as primitives of choice among admirers of heavy machinery, these Aussies are a little too archetypal for my tastes. Angus Young does come up with killer riffs, though not as consistently as a refined person like myself might hope, and fresh recruit Brian Johnson sings like there's a cattle prod at his scrotum, just the thing for fans who can't decide whether their newfound testosterone is agony or ecstasy. AC/DC can't decide either--""Shoot to Thrill,"" ""Given [sic] the Dog a Bone,"" and ""Let Me Put My Love Into You"" all concern the unimaginative sexual acts you'd imagine, and ""What Do You Do for Money Honey"" has a more limited set of answers than the average secretary would prefer. My sister's glad they don't write fantasy and science fiction, and if you're female you're free to share her relief. Brothers are more deeply implicated in these matters.

Like so many live albums, it promises the real deal and then reduces an event that once engaged five or more senses to an aural abstraction. Worse, the percussive bias of both recording method and performance concept undercuts the momentum of the ensemble groove. Ruined by the Fallacy of the Drum Solo, in quadruplicate.

These prognathous New Englanders are musicianly (all things are relative) inheritors of the Grand Funk principle: if a band is going to be dumb, it might as well be American dumb. Here they're loud and cunning enough to provide a real treat for the hearing-impaired, at least on side one. Have a sense of humor about themselves, too, assuming ""Lord of the Thighs"" is intended as a joke. With dumb bands it's always hard to tell.

The problem with the multiple-riff hi-test jobs that made Rocks rock was that when time came to follow up, the band was out of gas. The best of the three good ones here is a mold-breaking Joe-Perry-alone boogie that probably reflects the usual ""internal tensions."" Perry goes nowhere near the mold-breaking ""Kings and Queens,"" synthesized medieval pomp-rock (cf. Styx, Rush) that proves beyond doubt that they won't bite ""The Hand That Feeds."" We knew it all along, guys.

Four sides comprising seven titles--only two of them repeated (ad infinitum) from the band's studio albums--and they sure do boogie. But even if Duane Allman plus Dickey Betts does equal Jerry Garcia, the Dead know roads are for getting somewhere. That is, Garcia (not to bring in John Coltrane) always takes you someplace unexpected on a long solo. I guess the appeal here is the inevitability of it all.

Unable to resist the excessive eloquence of new producer Mitchell Froom and the slam-bang fills of new drummer Tim Mooney, or else in a really crummy mood, Doyen of Depression Mark Eitzel wallows in it. The much admired epitome is ""Apology for an Accident,"" where, among other things, he emotes the excellent lines ""I've been praying a lot lately/It's because I no longer have a TV"" as if nothing so horrible had ever befallen a drunk with too much time to kill. Unsurprisingly (although it was a bitter pill at first), ""What Godzilla Said to God When His Name Wasn't Found in the Book of Life"" isn't funny either. Oversinging and all, ""Johnny Mathis' Feet"" is. It's also the wisest thing on the record, which isn't to say it's wise in any absolute sense. That comes later, we hope--but don't necessarily expect.

What's made him the decade's premier country star artistically has been his disinclination to act like one--he's never climbed on the Nashville assembly line like Skaggs and Strait and so many smaller fry. Until now. He goes for George's intensity rather than Merle's hang-loose, but he won't convince you he thought these songs were special, and though this may mean the truth is still in him, don't bet on it--not after he yanked the difficult-to-program album he's got in the can. And just in case country radio isn't mollified, he provides a gratuitous cover of Merle's ""Fightin' Side of Me."" In the Vietnam era jingoistic trash at least made sense on its own neurotic terms.

Telescoping into a year and a half the kind of career that used to take a decade, Adam fires his group, hires some horns, and tops off his meretricious, arrogantly bombastic flop follow-up with some ruminations on life's little ups and downs. The first surprise is that four of these are arrogantly catchy. The second surprise is that all four dwell--allusively in the title tune--on Adam's status as victim-of-the-press, a theme that was death to rock and roll in a less self-conscious age. Still has trouble with real life, though, which is probably why the rest bombs.

Whose voice touches who is personal, but that doesn't mean Antony will ever reach as many humans as Aretha Franklin or Billie Holiday, and up against the archer Bryan Ferry, the artier Rufus Wainwright, and the grander Nina Simone, objective physical differences manifest themselves: he's thinner, drier, more strained. Not only is his willingness to express emotion commoner than indie denizens imagine, his failure to undercut that emotion with irony or humor is a spiritual weakness. Right, he suffers. But billions of humans have it worse, and while we who are luckier are morally obliged to remember that, we're not obliged to empathize with any of them. Those convinced of the metaphoric-political centrality of transgender issues and the AIDS epidemic will feel Antony's songs. Those who don't should find a record they enjoy.

""Veering between an eerie beauty and an almost nightmarish desolation,"" intoneth Frank Owen. ""Imbuing machine music with spirituality,"" saith Simon Reynolds. And, most incredibly, ""Always a groove going on,"" quoth J.D. Considine. I mean, what are these dudes talking about? Not that ambient-techno wunderkind Richard James is offensive--when I played all two-and-a-half hours of this at a quiet thermal spring in Puerto Rico, the worst any of the attendant pensioners could say about James's nightmarish desolation was ""interesting."" And smack dab against Eno's instrumental box--well, if James really gets ""physically ill if [his] music sounds like anybody else's,"" that's one consumer object he'd best not sully his expanded consciousness with. Thing is, James is rarely as rich as good Eno, not to mention good Eno-Hassell or Eno-Budd. One piece here does the trick (no titles or track listings--too Western, y'know--but it is, how crass, the lead cut) by folding in a child's voice (or is that one of his electronic friends?). In general, however, these experiments are considerably thinner (""purer,"" Owen wishes) and more static (""pulse dreamily,"" Considine dreams) than the overpriced juvenilia on the import-only Volume I. Anyway, a lot of Eno's ""ambient"" music could also be described as bland wallpaper. When Kyle Gann or (please God) Tom Johnson pumps a minimalist, I wonder whether I'm missing something. Otherwise I believe my own ears--and pull out David Berhman's On the Other Ocean/Music From a Clearing when I need deep background.

Not your average record, since some of it is bloody awful. But at its best--the title tune, with its gently shuddering guitar line, and ""Ballad of the Remo Four,"" a lament for the group's long-lost pre-Beatle Liverpool days that sounds like the best of Doug Sahm and Boz Scaggs in one cut--it's bloody terrific.

Where their opposite numbers in Steel Pulse yoke reggae militance to rock aggression, they soften reggae hope with pop salesmanship. Singing sweeter and smarmier than Gregory Isaacs if not Billy Ocean, Brinsley Forde doesn't lend much force to lyrics like ""Set Them Free"" and ""Back to Africa."" Nor does their obvious eagerness to insert cutesy hooks do much for their aura of righteousness. Like so many black pop best-ofs, this one showcases beautiful music--I dig their dabs of dub. But if Lionel Richie came up with a liberal lie on the order of ""Give a Little Love""--""Only we can make it better/Only if we try""--reggae fans would cry Babylon from here to Nostrand Avenue.

If anything, his fancy hackwork diminishes them-whether it's starters like the Drifters, the Shirelles, and Dusty Springfield or second-stringers like Gene Pitney, Jackie DeShannon, and end-of-the-bencher Chuck Jackson, all sound about as good as you'd expect and all peaked elsewhere. Then there are Lou Johnson, B.J. Thomas, Bobby Vinton, and the hapless Bacharach himself, not to mention horrid one-shots by Richard Chamberlain, Bobby Goldsboro, Trini Lopez, Jill O'Hara, gad.

As a reggae band, they were a hardcore band with a change-up; as a metal band, they're a hardcore band with a great windup and no follow-through. The small problem is H.R.'s lyrics, which he's still smart enough to blur with the speed and attitude that make the lead and title cut their strongest song since ""Pay to Cum.""

Since a strong singer (Paul Rodgers, who's letting the hair on his chest grow out) usually dominates a strong guitarist (Mike Ralphs, who's devoting himself to Paul Kossoff impressions anyway), this is less Mott the Hoople without pretensions (which are missed) than Free poppified (but not enough, hit single or no hit single).

This rocks even more consistently than Bad Co., but to argue that it epitomizes hard rock as a style is not only to overlook its deliberate speed but to believe in one's (usually male) heart that Paul Rodgers is the ideal rock singer. You hear that a lot; what it seems to mean is that he doesn't shriek when he gets to the loud parts. Rodgers's power is no more interesting than Tom Jones's, and Jones is twice as subtle. If hard rock doesn't have more to offer, it's not worth arguing about.

Almost imperceptibly, album by album, they soften their Free-derived formalism--not only does this one include ten (why, that's almost eleven!) different tunes, but the dynamics shift and the tempos accelerate slightly and Paul Rodgers actually sounds a little soulful. Which needless to say is a mixed blessing. It's not just that the lyrics are dumb, although there are smarter ways of being dumb than this, but that Rodgers emotes these egregious hip-and-funky clich������������������s as if he's never run across such sentiments before in his life.

Once again I'm forced to wonder whether I wouldn't like this record if it were by the Beatles. But without mentioning what the question says about the group, which is called Badfinger, the answer is that the Beatles couldn't have made this record. Except for ""Day After Day"" and ""Perfection,"" not one of these unabashedly tuneful tunes has any magic to it, which isn't simply a matter of cautious tempos and harmonies--it's a matter of magic. Nor will any of them add any phrases verbal or musical to our common language, although they might keep a few in circulation. Also, the Beatles put nicer pictures on the cover--pictures of themselves.

Having listened far more than natural inclination dictated, I've become actively annoyed with this vocal watershed. From its strong lounge-jazz beat to its conscious avoidance of distracting lyrical detail, it's all husky, burnished mood, the fulfillment of the quiet-storm format black radio devised to lure staider customers away from white-bread temptations like soft rock and easy listening. God knows it's more soulful, and sexier, too, but that's all it is--a reification of the human voice as vehicle of an expression purer than expression ever ought to be.

Just when I'd made my peace with pop prog and begun to hope arty prog would prove another casualty of the age of digital instantaneity, these postrock warriors get the bright idea of adding tune and humor to their higher mathematics. Just goes to show how hard up some aesthetes are for the hooks and jokes that are still so plentiful in less rarefied precincts. Swing less than Jeff Beck, Dixie Dregs or Big Lazy, rock more than Gentle Giant, Love Tractor or Tortoise.

Except for the sophomoric ""Student Demonstration Time,"" the songs on the first side are all right--""Take a Load Off Your Feet"" is worthy of Wild Honey and ""Disney Girls (1957)"" is worthy of Jack Jones's Greatest Hits--but the pop impressionism of side two drags hither and yon. The dying words of a tree are delivered in an apt, gentle croak, but the legendary title opus is an utter failure even on its own woozy terms and there are several disasters from the guest lyricists--Van Dyke Parks's wacked-out meandering is no better than Jack Rieley's.

Bill Nelson's guitar tone is pretty remarkable--thick yet ductile, by Phil Manzanera out of Randy California--and here he makes up for empty-headed improvisations with a career's worth of ID riffs.

Never before have I been fully convinced that Beck could improvise long lines, or jazz it up with a modicum of delicacy, or for that matter get funky. But he still has absolutely nothing to say. It's not that he's jettisoned the vocalist--lots of jazzmen say plenty without words.

I like it so much, in fact, that I find the 4:10 single version a little scant--not enough strings, fancy that--and I'm sorry to report that the specially mixed disco disc is a promotion only item.

After all, the Faces and the Allmans weren't such hot songwriters either, and their heirs don't exactly have a Young Rod or a Gregg-and-Dickey to compensate. With seven of Southern Harmony's 10 live-in-the-studio cuts going on longer than 17 of Exile on Main Street's thick-mixed 18, call them the new Humble Pie and put out a search on DFX2's Emotion. Now there was a Stones rip.

""Refusing to preach about politics, guns and bitches,"" as one admirer puts it (""Thankfully there's no inkling of misogyny or homophobia--how refreshing!""), these well-meaners are the Jurassic Five's answer to Arrested Development. Proficient, bland, and dauntingly dull, their only threat is a promise to ""take it back to the days of Mantronix"" (no, please, anything but that). I can only guess why they clock corporate cash while accessible and manifestly civilized West Coast alt-rap megatalents like Lyrics Born, Del, and Aceyalone explore bootstrap entrepreneurship. Maybe they lucked into connected management. Maybe they take good meeting. Or maybe their very lack of content has the advantage of cosseting the commercial preconceptions that count for so much more with sellers than buyers.

Depleted by the kind of corporate strife I thought these guys were too cynical to fall for (which may be why they did), Henry Rollins's adrenalin gives out. The consequent depression is so monumental that even Greg Ginn succumbs, adding only one classic to his catalogue of noise solos (""The Swinging Man"") and grinding out brain-damaged cousins of luded power chords behind the three dirges that waste side two. But things do start off manically enough, with the title tune (refrain: ""You're one of them"") and five minutes of Henry explaining why he smiles so much (which I never noticed).

As he'll be happy to tell you if only you ask and probably even if you don't--at great length, all the gory details, plenty of asides, with bells on--Larry Kirwan has been around. The Major Thinkers, Turner &amp; Kirwan of Wexford, God knows and I've forgotten what and who else--failure after failure, always with Kirwan struggling against the injustice of his continued obscurity. And though he's finally landed a major-label contract and three pounds of clippings, he's still struggling, for in truth now, Black 47 hasn't exactly eaten SoundScan for breakfast. Kirwan has plenty of brains and the gift of gab, but he's always overdone it, and these 16 songs last 70 minutes, the better to undergird their hefty arrangements--guitar-bass-drums, pipes and whistles, horn section, arena-jig beat, colleens, gad. Worst of all are Kirwan's vocals, soul-as-melodrama rockism with a brogue. The Irish immigrant underground is a great subject, and Kirwan knows its stories even if he overdoes those too. Maybe some laconic guy with an acoustic guitar will cover a few when the smoke clears.

He wrote them, all right, but only once--on an amazing ""All Shook Up"" that ranks with Presley's--does the singer in him manage to reclaim what was long ago appropriated from the composer. His pipes could be better, and a stiff backup band doesn't help, but the basic problem is that Blackwell lacks authority as a performer--he may have invented a bag of tricks for Elvis and Jerry Lee, but he never developed enough sleight-of-manner to put them across.

It's odd at best that the two hits and the two high points are the two songs predicated on black sources--the resourceful reggae cover ""The Tide Is High"" and the genius rap rip ""Rapture"" (which stands, let me assure my fellow Flash fans, as the funniest, fondest joke she ever told on herself). Elsewhere power pop turns power cabaret and Sgt. Pepper turns white album, only without Lennon-McCartney, or even McCartney. Debbie sings better all the time, but a better singer  than she'll ever be couldn't save ""T-Birds,"" or ""Faces."" They got what they wanted and now what?

I didn't like them initially because I was under the impression they were a ""group""--a musical aggregation--when in fact they're a comedy troupe who play instruments. Explaining why I don't like (i.e., laugh at) them in retrospect is harder--responses to comedy are even more personal than responses to music. Just say that what they do strikes me as boarding-school humor--covertly classbound escapist silliness without Monty Python's moral underpinnings. This generous two-disc compilation, an hour and forty minutes of entertainment in all, is intelligent and imaginative. But it's also narrow for the worst reasons.

Debut pomposities having been excised, a pure exploration of corporate rock remains. Pretty streamlined.

This is a failure. The tunes make (Lennon-McCartney's) ""Across the Universe"" sound like a melodic highlight, and although the amalgam of English hard rock and Philly soul is so thin it's interesting, it often overwhelms David's voice, which is even thinner. But after the total alienation of Diamond Dogs and the total ripoff of David Live, I'm pleased with Bowie's renewed generosity of spirit--he takes pains to simulate compassion and risks failure simply by moving on. His reward is two successes: the title tune, in which pain stimulates compassion, and (Bowie-Lennon-Alomar's) ""Fame,"" which rhymes with pain and makes you believe it.

It isn't music that makes Bragg so much fun live, so I'm not surprised that the songs are as flat here as in their studio versions--especially since some of them are studio versions.

Lines repeat from song to song--""The long-haired hippies and the Afro blacks/All get together off behind the tracks/And they party""--and so do riffs. The hook on the twelve-minute ""Please, Please"" (not to be confused, of course, with ""Please, Please, Please"") repeats one hundred forty-eight (and a half) times. I love the hook, I even like the line, and if this were the world's only James Brown album it would be priceless.

In which JB eases the tempo and stops using his voice as a conga drum, thus fashioning a languorous funk that I guess is designed to compete with Barry White. It's not horrible, but I'd just as soon hear the competition--after all, what's JB without intensity? And then suddenly he says fuck it and closes the record with a seven minute jam on ""Kansas City"" so sharp it could bring back the lindy hop, at least in dreams.

""I'm Black, I'm Back?"" is how JB begins the commercial message on the jacket, and the title track is his biggest single in a year and a half. ""I can see the disco now,"" he emphasizes, and even the blues and the ballad cultivate a groove designed to reintroduce him to that alien world he founded. But he sounds defensive because he has a reason to be--he can't hit the soft grooves the way he can the hard ones. When he starts equating himself with Elvis Presley (just before the fade on ""I Refuse to Lose""), you know the identity problems are getting critical.

Browne reminds me of Nixon: no matter how hard I listen to his pronouncements--important sociologically if nothing else, right?--my mind begins to wander. They're getting longer, too; the eight songs here average over five minutes. I admit that the longest is also the best, an intricate extended metaphor called ""Fountain of Sorrow.""

It's so late she stays over, and I watch her sleep, you know? God. But she wakes up pretty early and we kiss goodbye and she gets in the car and then what do you think happens? The U-Haul breaks free and there's dishes all over the road. It seemed awful at the time, the mess and the delay had me stressing, but I gotta laugh about it now. And you know the funniest part? Without her noticing I kept some of those dishes--you're eating your pizza off one right now. More oregano?'' Well, that's how I'd replot the best song here--in Buckner's version it's ditches all over the road, and he still thinks the whole thing was awful.

My friend from New Haven says, ""Except for `17 Years on Your River,' I don't think I'd like this record if I weren't from New Haven."" Exactly. This is the kind of testament every loyal local group ought to leave, with a few excellent songs (I also like ""Living in the Country"") and lots of memories for all the folks it's entertained. Unfortunately, few local groups ever reach this level of competence, but in any case the economics of the music industry discourage such moderate success--if your appeal isn't big-time, you're lucky to record at all, and if it is, chances are even or better that you're working a dumb variation on somebody else's gimmick. Which is not to suggest that I'd give up one great industry group like Crazy Horse for a dozen Sky Dog Bands, but merely to lament a paradox.

With Pat Place slash-sliding away and Cynthia Sley OK to be in the same room with, the postliberated axe-women of Emma Goldman's (Zelda Fitzgerald's?) version of the Contortions were an up on chutzpah alone. A pioneering rhythm-and-paranoia band, their ""Too Many Creeps""/""Snakes Crawl""/""You Taste Like the Tropics"" summed up the Lower East Side circa 1980.

The modishly far-out rhythms and textures here are so authentic they recall Jimmy Witherspoon or Bobby Bland casting desperately about for a hit. The bluesman fluffs one ballad and sounds a little strange doing romantic patter, and producer Henry Glover has for some reason set his own ""Breadline"" amid enough instruments to feed a family of four for six months, but once you conquer your suspicion that this is a disaster it sounds pretty good.

The Byrds' Greatest Hits, a profit-taking retrospective from later in the year, sounds like a triumph of produced and programmed rock and roll, while The Notorious Byrd Brothers and Sweetheart of the Rodeo, which followed it in '68, are two of the most convincing arguments for artistic freedom ever to come out of American rock. But this April '67 failure suffers from two related '67 maladies: pretentiousness and self-expression. David Crosby's ""Mind Garden"" is a completely unlistenable acid meander, while four (three too many) innocuous folk-rock cum countryrock tunes by Chris Hillman are a familiar-sounding example of how an uninteresting self does its number.

Two good white gospel (a fundamentalist and a modernist) plus one good Roger McGuinn song (out of four, and he needed a collaborator) plus one good Skip Battin song (he needed a collaborator too--Kim Fowley). In sum, better than Farther Along, but if you can only tell arithmetically how much difference can it make?

FALSE,B-,Okie,J.J. Cale,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6534,"
For J.J., this is adventurous stuff--""I Got the Same Old Blues"" states his world view (you don't have to listen, just read the title), ""Starbound"" adapts his style to some (awful) space pop, and ""The Old Man and Me"" introduces a character whom he isn't making it with (at least he doesn't mention it).

FALSE,B-,Feel Me,Cameo,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4496,"
Incredibly, or do I mean accidentally, their sixth album in four years on the production line is a discernible improvement, and not because the hits (or lyric sheet) are necessary. It's all groove and sound: drummer/leader shows off like bosses do, Moog man's old-fashioned Walter Carlos gurgles fit da funk like they ruined der Bach, and the slow ones are down to two, one a bow to the Spinners.

FALSE,B-,Soon Over Babaluma,Can,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5930,"
A basically instrumental excursion that aficionados rank with the sprawling Tago Mago, this 1974 Kraut-rock opus is to the Miles Davis of the era as acid jazz is to real jazz. It's never pompous, discernibly smart, playful, even goofy. If you give it your all you can make out a few shards of internal logic. But the light tone avoids texture, density, or pain. The jazzy pulse is innocent of swing, funk, or sex. And if it generates any intrinsic interest, as opposed to the conceptual kick of being so singularly European, after half a dozen plays I should have some inkling what that interest is.
"
FALSE,B-,Hallelujah,Canned Heat,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10834,"
The best Canned Heat lp solely because it contains four (of 11) cuts by Alan Wilson, who has one of the great freak voices and writes songs to match. As usual, it is dominated by Bob ""Rastus"" Hite, who must have been responsible for Rolling Stone's suggestion that the next Canned Heat album be called ""Yassuh Boss."" He is most offensive on one of those ""introducing the band"" jams (""Henry shoah does have the feelin', yeah"") and on another exercise in solipsism called ""Canned Heat."" I am sure I only forgive him his version of Fats Domino's ""Big Fat"" because I don't happen to know the original. Still, Wilson's talent is too peculiar to fill an album. I wonder what should be done with him.

I've always suspected that underneath the naive surrealism the Captain might be a dumbbell, and now that he's really (really really) trying to go commercial he's providing proof. This time he really (really) does it--writes dumb little songs with dumb little lyrics and dumb little hooks. Maybe all the dumb dumb parts can be blamed on svengali and cocomposer Andy DiMartino. And I admit that a lot of these are passable (""Magic Be"") to wonderful (""Sugar Bowl"") dumb little songs. But they're still dumb. Really.

Supposedly, this album consists of outtakes from Cap's previous Andy DiMartino LP, but if anything I prefer it. ""Party of Special Things to Do"" (mama told him not to come) and ""Observatory Crest"" (Beefheart's first make-out song) surround his cover of ""Same Old Blues"" so cunningly that after a while you start to forget J.J. Cale, and before you know it you're at the funky harmonica features that closes side one.

FALSE,B-,Butterfly Kisses (Shades of Grace),Bob Carlisle,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6230,"
I don't hate the single like I'm supposed to--I think it's healthy for Christians to acknowledge the erotic subtext of parental love, and anyway, I choke up a little when she gets married (stop smirking unless you have a pubescent daughter). I note that as pop oversingers go he's on the human side of Celine and Hanson. And I like the professed humility of lines like, ""I'm not tryin' to preach to ya/and tell you that I've found all the easy answers/when half the time I can't even find my keys."" But the problem isn't just that this promise keeper is lying--music is his ministry, and damn straight he uses it to preach. It's that only on his fluke hit does he have the grace to universalize his beliefs even as much as Kirk Franklin, who makes his song about ""mustard seed faith"" signify even though it's far more God-proud. Carlisle is a niche evangelist, addressing the men's-movement generation of alienated suburban husbands, white and Protestant assumed. He's pretty good at it. But he's so short on true proselytizing zeal that no one else will give a shit once his smash crashes.

Why do I believe this Nashville liberal showers three times a day and doesn't think sex is the right place to get your face wet? Is it the Stones riff that marches by as neatly as the quaint mandolin-and-harpsichord figure? The voice that never doubts its own clarity? Creative writing like ""The sepia tones of a lost afternoon/Cradle a curio storefront""? As dull as Al Gore and Ralph Nader put together.

That a ""dumb"" purveyor of Farfisa retro should transform his Chicago joke into anti-imperialist militance didn't flabbergast smart hedonism fans--only that he then produced effective anti-imperialist songs in his hedonistic silly-detail mode.

The problem's not immersion in formula. The problem's not exhaustion of formula. The problem's boredom with formula. This is longer, slower, and denser as well as older, with lyrics that skirt social commentary and music that essays textural pretension. Its peaks are ""Touch and Go"" and ""Up and Down.""

This ain't jazz, it's modern chamber music, quite European in view of its ostensible subject, which is how Afro-European mercantilism became the slave trade. In the modern European manner, its real subject is itself--explorations of color and texture that are worth tagging along on occasionally, but best left to the specialists and their grant money most of the time.

Much inferior to Folsom Prison and Greatest Hits, which is where to start if you're just getting into Cash. Contains only nine songs, one of which is performed twice. Another was written by Bob Dylan.

FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits Volume 3,Johnny Cash,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6552,"
In 1968, his marriage to June Carter and his Folsom Prison album made Cash look like the greatest artist in country music, but who today would think of ranking him with George Jones, Willie Nelson, or Merle Haggard? A diminished singer, writer, and public presence, he hasn't even put together enough singles for a worthwhile best-of. Here are two duets with Waylon and one with June, two decent love songs by others and three flabby ones by himself, and you know what you'll remember next day? ""Oney"" and ""One Piece at a Time,"" both about working the assembly line. Somehow I don't expect him to take the hint.
"
FALSE,B-,Rockabilly Blues,Johnny Cash,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4514,"
Merely by copping to the magic concept ""rockabilly,"" Cash can kick up comeback talk. And comparison with his rockabilly rockabilly for Sun (where he was always the countriest) establishes that by the standards of an ordinary mortal he's a better singer now--more flexible physically, more expressive emotionally. But the technique is a cover for what's lost, probably forever--stolid depth as immovable presence. Same goes for the arrangements--defiantly understated for Nashville, they're customized rock-country up against the austerities of the Tennessee Two. In other words, an honorable country album with some pretty good songs on it.

Survivors of what, pray tell. Oh--of whom. We get it. We know you all were trying, too--especially Big Jawn, whose concert it was. So we regret to inform you that you sound dissipated anyway, which has an odd effect on the gospel tunes and makes for the most magnificently thrown-away ""Whole Lotta Shakin'"" of Jerry Lee's intensely nonchalant career.

These Southern brothers relate to soul rather than boogie, with a nice gain in structure, but they could use some surface flash to highlight all that sincerity, which is a lot more profound in the vocalization than the verbalization in any case.

Boy, has this shit dated--it's worn as thin as the sidemen's professionalism and James's embouchure. And the titles go beyond petty candor into keep-your-self-to-yourself-please--a ""White Cannibal"" with ""Money to Burn"" and (give this boy a benefit) ""Sophisticated Cancer""? Sure it's nice to hear ""King Heroin"" covered with so much soul. But when he opens with ""I Feel Good, I Got You"" he's lying three ways.

Beyond thrilling to ""Bang Bang Bang"" and the inescapable ""Fast Car,"" my only felt insight into Chapman's aura came at a Nelson Mandela tribute where her voice filled the venue, which happened to be Yankee Stadium. Maybe it's a positive that her recordings never convey that kind of size--means she's more modest than her foremothers, Joan Baez and Odetta. But what's left is a joylessly self-sufficient gravity that makes her ""heaven's here on earth"" sound a lot more pro forma, not to say phonier, than her ""The whole world's broke/And it ain't worth fixing.""

What a letdown. With covers that range from silly (is that Jack ""Riding Thumb,"" after he hits the road?) to obvious (""We Had It All"" is quintessentially Charles country adequately rendered), and with a filler from his publishing subsidiary at a redundant nadir, the same old horn charts and obligatory big productions really begin to grate. Ray doesn't hit his stride until the last five words--one word, really--of the final cut, which is about poor people and addressed to the president: ""Can you dig it? Amen.""

The second side almost works as a best-of, but I'd wait for the studio job--despite the Japanese applause track, this was obviously recorded in the Big Room at Carlsbad Caverns. Arrangements are gratifyingly tight--ten titles on a single disc--but six of them are also available (even tighter) on In Color. Also: ""Ain't That a Shame,"" the intro of which ought to give pause to those who consider Rick Nielsen an innovative guitar player as opposed to showman; a throwaway collaboration with Tom Petersson; a nice Move ripoff; and ""Surrender.""
"
FALSE,B-,Dream Police,Cheap Trick,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6569,"
What's always saved this band for me was the jokes, but this time they're just not in the grooves, and there's only so much you can do with funny hats on the cover. A good heavy metal band, sure--be thankful for the fast tempos. But probably not a great heavy metal band. And you know what happens to good heavy metal bands long about the fifth album.

Watch out for this mild-mannered simp: underneath his lite croon, refabricated truisms, and avant-garde pedigree, he's got the tunes. The title track, an instrumental-with-chant composed by his trumpeter dad, points up how flimsy they are.

Recorded '84-'85, two years before Brave Worls, and it sounds it. First side you wonder why the songs aren't quite there--maybe it's you. Second side crumbles the quandry with ""Whole Weird World"" (""Nearly there . . . nearly,"" they claim) and the four-part (suite?) ""Dream by Dream."" Neither title is sufficiently ironic. Not juvenilia--they'd already been around four or five years. But only New Zealanders would guess.

FALSE,B-,E.C. Was Here,Eric Clapton,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10809,"
From Clapton a live album is welcome these days. At the very least it guarantees that his head was higher than his feet at time of recording, and live albums being what they are it also assures plenty of what he does best, which is play guitar. But though Clapton's choked lyricism can be exciting, he does have trouble breaking loose, and because George Terry's sound is so like his own their colloquies don't spark much. Besides, this is basically a blues album--four of the six cuts fit the category with varying degrees of authenticity--and I expect a blues album to be sung as well as played.
"
FALSE,B-,No Reason to Cry,Eric Clapton,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6583,"
A well-made, rather likable rock and roll LP that shows more pride and joy than the standard El Lay studio product, probably because the characters here assembled don't do this kind of thing all that much. The words are trite but the singing is eloquent and the instrumental signature an almost irresistible pleasure. But what does it all mean?

Whatever Eric isn't anymore--guitar genius, secret auteur, humanitarian, God--he's certainly king of the Tulsa sound, and here he contributes three new sleepy-time classics. All are listed on the cover sticker and none were written by Bob Dylan. One more and this would be creditable.

What did you expect him to call it--Hack? Layla and 461 Ocean Boulevard were clearly flukes: he has no record-making knack. So he farms out the songs, sings them competently enough, and marks them with his guitar. Which sounds kind of like Mark Knopfler's.

Laid-back doesn't equal dead--461 Ocean Boulevard is laid-back. What's wrong with this stopgap is it means to be inoffensive. Relegating Clapton-the-electric-guitarist to the mists of memory and capturing Clapton-the-pop-vocalist in a staid mood only an adrenaline junkie could confuse with the sly somnolence of ""I Shot the Sherriff"" and ""Willie and the Hand Jive,"" it turns ""Layla"" into a whispery greeting card. No wonder the pop star he most closely resembles on television is James Galway.

Unlike young Hilary Duff, 23-year-old Clarkson feels the responsibilities of stardom, which demand melodramatic overkill. The doctors give her stronger pills than, say, Clay Aiken--the prefab kissoff of ""Walk Away,"" the new wave heartbreak of ""Since U Been Gone,"" ""Because of You"" may just describe an occurrence, here's the verb ""implode,"" and ""There's no light at the end of the tunnel/Just a bridge that I gotta burn"" could hold up its end of a bargain. None of these survives Clarkson's larger-than-life ambitions or compressed-to-oppress production regimen. But she may have a heart, and it may end up in the right place.

I found this tremendously disappointing at first--not one song I could hang my head on. But the political analysis is at the very least sensible, no common thing in popular music, Cliff's singing is earnest and spirited enough to give the analysis some immediacy. And in a few cases--""Born to Win,"" ""The Price of Peace,"" and especially ""Under the Sun, Moon and Stars,"" about his parents--it isn't just the message that puts the tune across.

Cliff hasn't evinced this much interest in years, and his female backup sounds as sisterly as Bob Marley's. But any artist whose most specific songs concern spiritual deliverance--talkin' 'bout ""Bongo Man"" and, yep, ""Universal Love""--isn't out of the ether yet.

The auteur is rejected Club Vieux svengali Jay King, who proves which half of the one-shot had the professionalism by turning in a listenable as opposed to barely competent album.

Occasionally he hits a phrase that merits its aura of heightened significance: coming at the climax (not end) of ""Guerilla Betrayed,"" the line ""I'd like to put a bullet through the world"" says it all.

The bad music here can't be blamed on Phil Spector's melodies--Cohen has never posed as a particularly tuneful guy himself. And the main thing wrong with Spector's settings, banal though they are, is that they lack doors. Ordinarily, Cohen whispers, murmurs, whines, croaks, and even screams through the music.

One thing you know about a funk band that goes number one with something as sappy as ""Three Times a Lady""--they ain't as funky as they used to be. Or maybe they were never really a funk band to begin with--just potential pros who understood funk's entertainment potential the way John Denver understood folk music's. If they perceive any inflammatory potential in rhythm per se, they do what they can to dampen the fire. I love ""Brick House,"" ""Machine Gun,"" and ""Slippery When Wet,"" but they're not even on the same side of this depressing compilation, half of which is devoted to Lionel Richie and his mealy mouth.

A taste for the base usages of hard rock rarely comes with a hit attached these days, much less ""surreal,"" ""theatrical,"" and let us not forget ""transvestite"" trappings, which is why some desperate rock and rollers have convinced themselves their prayers are being answered. But while this is the band's most song-oriented LP, it falters after ""Under My Wheels"" and ""Be My Lover,"" neither of them an ""I'm Eighteen"" in the human outreach department.

With its all-time ugly vocal, kiddie chorus turned synthesizer, and crazy, dropped-out thrust, the title hit is as raw and clever as it gets, but this album is soundtrack.

FALSE,B-,Welcome to My Nightmare,Alice Cooper,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6629,"
The solo debut actually ain't so bad--no worse than all the others. ""Department of Youth"" is his catchiest teen power song to date, ""Cold Ethyl"" his catchiest necrophilia song to date, and ""Only Women Bleed"" the most explicitly feminist song to hit top forty since ""I Am Woman."" Alice's nose for what the kids want to hear is as discriminating as it is impervious to moral suasion, so perhaps this means that the more obvious feminist truisms have become conventional wisdom among at least half our adolescents. Encouraging.

FALSE,B-,Revenge Will Come,Greg Copeland,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4585,"
Producer Jackson Browne has gone after absolutely predictable midtempo studio rock, but with a tough edge that's augmented by Copeland, who sounds like (of all things) Jackson Browne with a tough edge. Propitious--if Copeland can move his mentor's personalist millenarianism far enough left to write protest lyrics that surrender neither psychological dimension nor American mythos, I bet other young rock mainstreamers are thinking the same way.
"
FALSE,B-,The Real Great Escape,Larry Coryell,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6635,"
A last-ditch attempt at an album of rock and roll songs, including two by Jimmy Webb (one belongs to P.F. Sloan), Julie's ""Are You Too Clever"" (somebody'd better be), and Larry's ""Makes Me Wanna Shout"" (lucky it doesn't make him wanna croon). Not as bad as it might be--it has lots of rough charm and virtuosic passages, and the band sounds gutsy. But those who seek after albums of rock and roll songs will not be impressed.

FALSE,B-,Almost Blue,Elvis Costello and the Attractions,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1156,"
Put this on the shelf behind Bowie's Pin Ups and Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll, which also seemed ""important"" when they appeared. Take it from me, EC fans: start with the Flying Burrito Brothers' Gilded Palace of Sin, then try 24 of Hank Williams' Greatest Hits, then George Jones's All-Time Greatest Hits: Volume 1, and Merle Haggard's Songs I'll Always Sing. Then start exploring.

FALSE,B-,Dennis Coulson,Dennis Coulson,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6637,"
Coulson exploits that natural catch in his voice, a hint of vibrato that walks the line between yearning and good cheer, to bridge his Scottish loyalties and his American stylistic referents--this is genuinely mid-Atlantic singing. But if you want to be an interpreter you'd better find interpretees who give you more to say than Gallagher &amp; Lyle. High point: ""Job on the Tyne,"" which he cocomposed. Hope he keeps trying.
"
FALSE,B-,August and Everything After,Counting Crows,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6227,"
Adam Duritz sings like the dutiful son of permissive parents I hope don't sit next to me at Woodstock. He went to good summer camps; he doesn't eat junk food; he's confused about all the right things. And he's not going away anytime soon--so starved are his peers for a show of musical emotion more learned than Mariah Carey's that some even compare him to Van Morrison, as if all sodden self-pity were the same. It doesn't end with Duritz, either--""Mr. Jones"" and ""Anna Begins"" might live up to the songs in them if the band conceived the tracks as music first and songs second. Folk-rockers never do.

After too many legends of Atlantis and concept albums about the last cowboy, I was impressed to come upon John Palumbo, who can end one of his existentialist fables ""Being is my . . . life"" and make it sound like an aper����������""Robots for Ronnie,"" ""A Sea Epic"") are brittle, while Palumbo's dense modal structures (and Rick Witkowski's guitar inventions) have real tensile strength.

FALSE,B-,Songs the Lord Taught Us,The Cramps,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4595,"
From the time they stormed a jaded--hence novelty-hungry--CBGB two or three years ago, they've been a joke that wears thin before it's over. ""TV Set"" and ""Garbage Man"" and a couple of others are everything they're supposed to be--archetypally rockin', outrageously funny. But when the songs are neither or even only one, the band's inability to sing, play, produce, or prance around your living room detracts significantly from your pleasure. Then you stop listening altogether.
"
FALSE,B-,At Crooked Lake,Crazy Horse,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6645,"
Rick and Mike Curtis, whoever they are, replace George Whitsell and John Blanton, whoever they were, and the improvement exceeds statistical likelihood. Anybody who misses circa-1966 Byrds will be pleased to learn that this country-rock album features songs about spaceships, the brotherhood of man, and singing in a rock and roll band. And disappointed to learn that none of them sounds like a sure shot.

FALSE,B-,You Don't Mess Around With Jim,Jim Croce,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15524,"
A nice, original persona here--the truck driver, world-weary machismo with a heart of gold--plus a song that should be even better than the title hit, ""Operator."" More than a novelty, less than the big star he doubtless wants to be, he'll be around.
"
FALSE,B-,Deja Vu,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6655,"
Of the five (or seven, I forget) memorable tunes here, N's ""Our House"" is a charming but cloying evocation of puppy domesticity, while both N's sanctimonious ""Teach Your Children"" and C's tragicomic ""Almost Cut My Hair"" document how the hippie movement has corrupted our young people. S half scores twice and in-law M provides the climax. Which leaves Y's ""Helpless"" as the group's one unequivocal success this time out. It's also Y's guitar--with help from S and hired hands T and R--that make the music work, not those blessed harmonies. And Y wasn't even supposed to be in on this.

FALSE,B-,4-Way Street,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6656,"
Was it only two years ago that the formation of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash brought gladness to the hearts of rock and rollers who remembered that they loved tight songs rather than endless jams and believed that an ex-Hollie's pop sense would temper Byrds/Springfield folk-rock? Who would have figured that none of them would remember that rock and roll is also supposed to be funky--and fast. And that the best stuff on their live album would be the jams, dominated by the new guy, who would also write their tightest songs? And for that matter that a singalong of dig-its and right-ons by the man who wrote ""For What It's Worth"" and a goody-goody song about  Chicago by the ex-Hollie would sound like political high points?
"
FALSE,B-,So Far,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6657,"
This group might benefit from a compilation that concentrated on guitar interactions and uptempo throwaways. Needless to say, that's not the one we get.
"
FALSE,B-,Alvin Crow and the Pleasant Valley Boys,Alvin Crow and the Pleasant Valley Boys,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6660,"
We can't be sure what it was like to hear Bob Wills's records as they came out in the '30s and '40s, but no matter what your Texas friends tell you it was a lot more exciting than this. For starters, Wills was an inventor rather than a flamekeeper, and he got clearer sound--he worked for major labels, after all. Also, Wills released singles, which means that unlike Crow he had to put out one A side for every B. Still, three or four A sides out of ten isn't bad. Just wish they were all as modern as ""Nyquil Blues,"" in which Crow praises analgesics, decongestants, and antihistamines--by name.

FALSE,B-,Floating into the Night,Julee Cruise,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8222,"
This new age chantoozy is no mushmelon: her sentimental schlock and quasi-classical quietude are at the forefront of the latest hip convolutions. And when admirers claim she sounds best in a dark room at three in the morning, I wonder whether she puts them to sleep too.
"
FALSE,B-,Twentysomething,Jamie Cullum,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12591,"
This Brit is good enough at what he does to make you wonder why he bothers. With Norah Jones putting young-person-with-old-ideas shtick in the bank, the commercial logic we get. But beyond a cross-generational reach achievable in any genre and a swinging musicality he negotiates with too much heavy breathing, what's the artistic payoff? Writingwise he ain't Sondre Lerche, much less Nellie McKay. Interpretively, ""Blame It on My Youth"" exploits his age for good cheap irony, ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is a nice Mitch Mitchell tribute, and that's it. You say Harry Connick Jr. would never try a Radiohead cover? Score one for New Orleans.

"
FALSE,B-,In Lust,The Dance,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11401,"
You'd think a band obsessed with sex as both physical and meaningful would make records with more touch and depth (not to mention thrust). Instead they're naggingly hypnotic at best and blandly tentative at worst. Must have something to do with their other obsession: ""survival"".
"
FALSE,B-,Honey in the Rock,Charlie Daniels,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6672,"
For a sideman-turned-sortastar, Daniels kicks out genuine jams and takes genuine chances--the raveup on ""Revelations,"" for instance, would sound plumb weird on an Allmans LP. Not a bad songwriter, either. But hardly a remarkable one, and he's a lousy singer--only on ""Uneasy Rider,"" a talking blues as dry as any of Dylan's and a lot more yarnlike, does his voice serve his vision, such as it is.
"
FALSE,B-,Lucifuge,Danzig II,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8696,"
I'm sure Glenn Danzig is right about Jim Morrison. If he hadn't given up the ghost, the fourth Door would have stepped up his flirtation with Satan and adjusted his music to a metallic pitch of precision preening. But then, I already knew Morrison was a putz. Misfits fans had convinced me to hold out some hope for Glenn.
"
FALSE,B-,Betty Davis,Betty Davis,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6677,"
Between her connections (wife of Miles, girlfriend of Jimi) and her concept (autonomous black woman forges metal funk), Betty's got a head start in the hype department. She makes up for these advantages, however, with a forced, narrow voice and a complete absence of riff sense or melodic gift. On the other hand, she--or producer-drummer Greg Errico of the Family Stone--does know a lot about rhythm. Upshot: most overstated comic-book sex since Angelfood McSpade.
"
FALSE,B-,Color of Success,Morris Day,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4626,"
Now that he's a movie star, Morris proposes to cover his flank and go straight. After all, the Time's comically cocksure overstatement was just a way to get the music noticed, and now that he's a household name his sidelong synthbeats will pull in the customers all by themselves. He thinks. I think people will demand beats and comedy both. We shall see.
"
FALSE,B-,We Have Come for Your Children,Dead Boys,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6686,"
Because they're lovable little scumbags deep down, and sincere to boot, Hilly's punk purists have dropped the heavy misogyny and recorded five cuts that laid end to end would make a listenable side. But not even the rousing ""3rd Generation Nation"" has the power of sexist spew like ""I Need Lunch"" and ""Caught With the Meat in Your Mouth."" Makes you wonder what 3rd generation nihilists believe deep down.
"
FALSE,B-,"In God We Trust, Inc.",Dead Kennedys,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4630,"
""Moral Majority,"" which proceeds directly from the Mickey Mouse club theme to a rousing verse prominently featuring the words ""Blow it out your ass,"" and the long-awaited ""Nazi Punks Fuck Off"" (""you'll be the first to go"") are their best songs or whatever since they attacked California and Cambodia. Both are available on a single. Forgo the documentary value of ""Kepone Factory""'s false start (""Itstooslow"") and the intensely appropriate ""Hyperactive Child."" Think small.
"
FALSE,B-,Eat Your Paisley,The Dead Milkmen,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4631,"
I was delighted that these hostile but not asocial fellows hadn't taken to agonizing over their girlfriends, assuming they have any--they were playing the songs for laffs just like on the debut. Then I noticed that except for ""Beach Party Vietnam"" I wasn't laffing (or even chuckling), only smiling encouragingly now and then. Between the right attitude and the right stuff falls the lead balloon.
"
FALSE,B-,"You're a Woman, I'm a Machine",Death From Above 1979,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12860,"
I don't get this. We listen to a Snoop or Lil Jon record--I do, anyway--and say, Yeah, the music is pretty good, but it's really no fun hearing women degraded that way, so the hell with those guys. Maybe if the funk is terrific (Cam'ron, or the new improved--and somewhat more mild-mannered--50) or the rhymes acute (Jay-Z, Ghostface), we let down our guard and try to hear how the other half feels. Otherwise no. So why is this tight, intense, recidivist screech-and-crunch exempted from such complex responses?  Preferring funk to crunch as I do, maybe I'm merely insensible to the guitars' siren call. Or maybe its slaves are insensible to misogyny that stops at cut-and-run man's-gotta-do you-hurt-me-too, rather than claiming to control that 'ho.
"
FALSE,B-,"Boston, Mass.",The Del Fuegos,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4644,"
This is the story of Dan Zanes--his passion, his pain, his steadfast refusal to hire a synth player. Its real location is Anywhere, U.S.A. ""I Still Want You"" would make some garage band a nice slow one.
"
FALSE,B-,The Dells,The Dells,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6692,"
Vocal groupies and Chicago soul loyalists believe Don Davis has revitalized the old-timers on this album and its predecessor, Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation. I suppose he has. But the Dells are quintessential journeymen, and when Davis made quasi-neo-Temptations out of the Dramatics he wrote the songs himself.
"
FALSE,B-,John Denver's Greatest Hits,John Denver,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6696,"
I still don't like Denver, who purveys privacy in hockey rinks and who never wonders how we are to ""maintain our society"" by contact with wilderness without destroying said wilderness. But except for the odious ""Follow Me""--so that's why he loves his Annie so much--I find this stuff inoffensive when it's not likable. Twice it's brilliant: ""Leaving, on a Jet Plane"" and ""Goodbye Again"" are the essence of domesticus interruptus. Not that he's as talented as many of his supposed rivals. But he aims lower.
"
FALSE,B-,The Layla Sessions,Derek and the Dominos,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5842,"
Sloughing off the myth of the album as artistic unit and denying proven spendthrifts a face-saving shred of consumerly discrimination, CD boxes are invariably about marketing rather than music. But this triple smells. Supposedly necessitated by the slovenliness of Layla's first digital remix, still for sale as a ""special-price"" double-CD even though the same material squeezes onto one disc here, it pretends that Eric Clapton's finest pickup band--which as the notes inadvertently remind us begat George Harrison's endless All Things Must Pass (you remember ""Apple Jam,"" now don't you?)--deserves the kind of genius treatment that's dubious even with great jazz improvisors. And since it unearths not much Duane Allman (no surprise, since he barely met the band), it cheats on the dueling-guitars fireworks that made Layla explode. This is pop, gang--arrangements matter. Outtakes are outtakes because the keepers are better. Jams take too long to get anywhere worth going. And when a mix trades raunch for definition, the exchange is usually moot.
"
FALSE,B-,Derringer,Derringer,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11301,"
This opens with ""Let Me In,"" a rocker of addictive cuteness and intelligence that has already stiffed as a single, despite a Cynthia Weil lyric that applies with equal precision to lost boys and lost men. Can anyone out there come up with another one to rescue it?
"
FALSE,B-,New Arrangement,Jackie DeShannon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6701,"
As an American songwriter who has escaped the confessional mode, and as a woman who can sing about subjects other than men, DeShannon exemplifies several healthy trends. The main thing this well-made record reveals, however, is an intelligent professionalism that matters about as much as a surge in enrollment in creative writing classes or women's liberation for female executives.
"
FALSE,B-,Feel the Need,Detroit Emeralds,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6706,"
If the first version of the early disco classic this album is named after, then entitled ""Feel the Need in Me,"" moved like a crack diesel, quickening one whole side of what would have been a pretty good LP in any case, then the remade track moves more like a monorail. And while in the end I don't appreciate the streamlining (especially since the B side is quite extraneous) it still sounds pretty good.
"
FALSE,B-,Duty Now for the Future,Devo,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1018,"
Side one, with its not-funny-enough instrumentals and evasive satire, was dire enough to make me suspect they'd made their arena-rock move before there was an arena in the world that would have them. But ""The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize"" and ""Secret Agent Man"" are as bright as anything on the debut, and the arrangements offer their share of surprizes.

FALSE,B-,A Mad and Faithful Telling,DeVotchKa,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14000,"
The most overrated band of the year (so far, so far) has never called a record Gypsy Vamps and Things. It did, however, call one Supermelodrama. Although Nick Urata can't match pipes with Richard Hawley, a plus in a way, he's hawking mellifluous overstatement flavored with a nostalgia far enough past its sell-by date that it stinks a little. Foregrounding Hungarian violins rather than Balkan brass, the Gypsy thing is more a borderline-genteel branding device. Humor is discernible in ""Basso Profundo,"" ""Head Honcho,"" and ""Transliterator""--if you seek it out, as I am paid to do. Songs one can relate to as songs are harder to come by.

FALSE,B-,Great Dictations: The Definitive Dickies Collection,The Dickies,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4661,"
Parody punks long dismissed as no-laff ninnies even in L.A., they're rehabilitating their reputations as their accounting careers fall through, with this '78-'80 compilation (in tandem with current product to remain nameless) the spearhead. So OK, sometimes they actually were funny--I like their Simon &amp; Garfunkel knockoff better than the Coolies'. I promise I'll play them on request if they promise I never have to think about them again.
"
FALSE,B-,Bloodbrothers,The Dictators,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6714,"
Because they're nice Jewish boys deep down, and sincere to boot, they offer good-humored satiric putdowns of kinky sex and teenage alienation, encouragement for R. Meltzer, and a patriotic anthem that might be scary if they were capable of sustaining the mood without cracking up. All of which is grounded, unfortunately, not in the great common store of stoopid-rock readymades but in the grade-C Blue Oyster Cult moves that their gradual accumulation of instrumental competence has earned them.
"
FALSE,B-,The Dictators Live: Fuck 'Em If They Can't Take a Joke,The Dictators,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4662,"
Twelve toons, which because they include three new originals and two new covers don't even constitute a half-assed best-of. As annotator Borneo Jimmy points out, ""Rock and Roll Made a Man Out of Me"" is for these boys an admission of defeat. To dig their stoopid smarts you'll have to seek out Go Girl Crazy, cut before they turned into grown-up buffoons with pro-am chops, and funnier without stage patter than this is with.

FALSE,B-,Revelling/Reckoning,Ani DiFranco,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10321,"
""The songs/they come out more slowly/Now that I am the bad guy,"" she allows in the best song-not-track here. But maybe admitting that you require more patience than the average lover has in him or her is a way of evading harder truths--namely, that songs also come out more slowly when you're selling as opposed to defining yourself, as she did for so long with such charm, chutzpah, wit, grit, and politics. This is a double album where the best songwriting never meshes with the best horn writing, which is what gets her juices going these days. That is, it's a double album marking a year she should have taken off. Intelligence you can count on. Integrity you can foster. But inspiration requires more patience than the average genius has in her, and let us not forget the average label owner.

D&amp;C succumb to the folk fallacy. That is, they relate themselves to an alien and/or past musical style, purist country western, rather than relating the style to themselves, as Gram Parsons does. The songs are good and well-played, and two cuts--a brilliant version of ""Don't Let Me Down"" and Clark's ""Corner Street Bar""--transcend the Bad Concept which ruins this album for me. But I know damned well that I may never play it again, because basically it's just another archive.

FALSE,B-,Sanctuary,Dion,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6717,"
Armed with an acoustic guitar and a wire-rimmed smile, Dion has been projecting the aura of the quintessential Bronx rocker ever since reviving his career in clubs three years ago. On this LP he applies his sweet, sliding, blues-based style to both quintessential Bronx rockers and acoustic-guitar specialties, though his good-humored stage patter seems coyer every time it repeats. Still wish he (or Warners) would put ""Your Own Back Yard,"" his song about him and heroin, on an album. And forget ""Abraham, Martin, and John.""

Boy, people are getting bored with these guys fast--if they don't watch out they're gonna last about as long as Looking Glass or the Lemon Pipers. Just another case of ""substance"" as novelty, I guess--doesn't sound bad, but they'd better up those beats-per-minute.
"
FALSE,B-,Brothers in Arms,Dire Straits,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4666,"
""Money for Nothing"" is a catchy sumbitch, no getting around it, and the first side moves with simple generosity, not a virtue one associates with this studio guitarist's ego trip. But it's too late for the old bluesboy to suck us into his ruminations of the perfidy of woman and the futility of political struggle, and ""Money for Nothing"" is also a benchmark of pop hypocrisy. We know Mark Knopfler's working-class antihero is a thicky because he talks like Randy Newman and uses the same word for homosexual that old bluesboys use, a word Knopfler has somehow gotten on the radio with no static from the PMRC. I mean, why not ""little nigger with the spitcurl"" instead of ""little faggot with the earring,"" Mark? And while we're at it, how the hell did you end up on MTV? By spelling its name right?
"
FALSE,B-,Money for Nothing,Dire Straits,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4667,"
An active member of the Fraternal Order of Old Farts since birth, Mark Knopfler has always identified simply, spontaneously, and soddenly with anybody who's bitter because life has passed him by--no, not ""him or her,"" that's just the kind of pussyfooting a man's man won't abide. He's most convincing when directing his empathy at musicians--cf. ""Sultans of Swing,"" in which glam types reject trad tsk-tsk, and ""The Walk of Life,"" in which our hero dances as best he can. Skillfully accompanied on guitar, his supposedly unfashionable ressentiment has made him a rich man. How could such a thing happen?

FALSE,B-,"He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper",DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4672,"
From Fabian and Chubby Checker to Cosby and this crew, Philadelphia has always produced too many unthreatening teen dreams--it's enough to make you stop worrying and love Schoolly-D. Though I grant the Fresh Prince's acting ability and find myself touched when he tells the crowd he's 17, he makes the mistake of coming on smug in a genre whose staple is confidence. In life, maybe the wheedle is more socially advanced than the demand; in art, it's a turnoff.

Decking their cover with quotes from Durutti and Chagall and slogans like ""Bring Back the Future"" and ""We Don't Need Unity . . . We Need Co-Operation,"" these Vancouver lifers have obviously made something of their hardcore anarchism. If only the music had as much spirit. Amid the slightly Britified metal-mania so many professional punks drift into, the great moments are stolen--a speed-anthem cover of ""Singin' in the Rain"" and a ""Hot Blooded"" rip calling for a ""General Strike."" But since property is theft, maybe that's as it should be.

FALSE,B-,Revisited,Dr. Hook,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6728,"
Although his rock and roll number with this band was often forced and unfunny, you have to admire Shel Silverstein's eye for detail and ear for diction, his willingness to go for the aorta, and his did-he-mean-that? humor. This compilation includes ""Cover of the Rolling Stone,"" still an acute account of the superstar half-life, and ""Carry Me, Carrie,"" based on a text by Theodore Dreiser, as well as several salubriously blas������������������ references to ""Penicillin Penny,"" who after all got her dose from someone with a penis.

By playing the preserver of New Orleans piano tradition, the Dr. does an injustice to his equally fertile heritage as a music-biz sharpie, and too often on his second unaccompanied mostly-instrumental album he's as pleasant and boring as any other session man doing his thing. The new Pomus-Rebennack tune that kicks off side two raises hopes of a half save--until he stops singing again.

Soul-seekers like myself are moderately mad for the obscure Total Destruction to Your Mind, which Mr. Dogg, formerly Atlantic producer Jerry Williams, put out on the obscure Canyon label a couple of years ago--strange, powerful, creaky voice, stranger sensibility, demented music. But the dementia on this moderately mad sequel seems laid on for appearance's sake. I'll be seeking on.

One problem with pinning your hopes on eccentrics is that they're hard to tell from cranks.

FALSE,B-,One Step Closer,The Doobie Brothers,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8224,"
The absence of must-hums brings into stark relief the magnitude of their debt to Steely Dan. Michael McDonald, of course, but more significantly Skunk Baxter, now departed and and you can't even tell, so sedulously do the other guitarists emulate his virtuoso harmonies. The Doobies are now socially responsible artists, stopping at nothing in their battle to let the radio audience taste musical quality in the breaks. If the songs themselves had any content, well then obviously there'd be no chance to enlighten the masses. Don't dare ask them to abandon this mission.

FALSE,B-,The Doors,The Doors,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10988,"
I admit that some of the tunes retain considerable nostalgic appeal, but there's no way I can get around it--Jim Morrison sounds like an asshole.
"
FALSE,B-,The Soft Parade,The Doors,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10968,"
No one even thinks about the Doors any more--such is fame--but this is an acceptable record, with predictable pretensions and two or three first-rate songs (""Touch Me,"" ""Wild Child""). Nothing to get excited about, either way.
"
FALSE,B-,Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine,The Doors,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6748,"
This two-LP compendium has a theme that goes beyond ""He's dead, so we'd better get in there quick."" It's Morrison-as-politician, compiled by an a&amp;r guy who took him seriously, and why not--in Morrison's politics, a&amp;r guys were adjuncts of the prime movers of history. This includes enough solid album tracks and post-13 hits to suck in the poppyboppers plus the best of the pretentious stuff--""Five to One,"" ""Horse Latitudes,"" ""When the Music's Over,"" and of course ""The End."" Which latter is the test--specifically the line ""Mother I want to yeearrrgh."" When I first heard it, it made me grimace; how it makes me guffaw. If it still gives you chills, you may want to buy this for your favorite niece of nephew. Inspirational Image: ""mute nostril agony.""

FALSE,B-,"Alive, She Cried",The Doors,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8226,"
The concert and sound-check tapes they've unearthed for the revival are of some quality, with Robbie Krieger a white blues twister on ""Little Red Rooster"" and Jim Morrison an effective focus as long as he just sings. But when he emits his poetry or deigns to lay his narcissistic come-on on an imaginary teeny-bopper, it is to duck. If kids today feel cheated by history because they never experienced the fabled Jimbo charisma first hand, that's one more reason to be glad there are no new rock heroes.

FALSE,B-,The Last Broadcast,Doves,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11815,"
I don't have the stomach to go check my Toto and Journey records; in fact, I don't have my Toto and Journey records. But the burden of proof is on the perp. Technically proficient, melodically resourceful, sonically up-to-date--Toto and Journey were all that. They also rocked moderato and sang as if thoughtfully plumbing their Caucasian feelings. Admittedly, the Brits' squarer sense of form boxes their corn up more discreetly, and their reassuring lyrical generalizations address matters of the spirit more than affairs of the heart. Also, they're not yet huge here, which means so much to young people seeking identities they don't have to share like Legos, although older people pining for their pop youth would just as soon they turn into the Beatles (sigh). Nevertheless, this is as vapid as it is expert, and if it ever does get huge here, a lot of slightly older people are going to wonder what they were thinking.
"
FALSE,B-,Wrong Side of Memphis,Johnny Dowd,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1809,"
The vita that marks this middle-aged Ithaca moving man as a genuwine everyman reduces just as readily to boho-with-a-day-job, and lest you look down on him he's careful to stick an ""existential"" into the one about the ""Average Guy,"" so-called. When he finds ""tender love,"" his tropes pick up considerable--""Like beans and rice she's a total plateful,"" nice and homely. But soon it's back to murder and misery in the dismal swamp quote unquote, with malnourished blues to match. Gangsta folk--not only are the stories old hat, the beats suck.

FALSE,B-,Medicine Show,The Dream Syndicate,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4686,"
Very subtle--the sharper you listen the duller it sounds. Those desperate for Tom Verlaine's next one might conceivably settle for Sandy Pearlman's ampliclarification of Karl Precoda's guitar, but now that Steve Wynn is flexing his literary imagination we know where the interpersonal vignettes on the debut came from: when he grows up, Steve wants to write new journalism about adolescent anomie for California magazine.

Liars till the end, they pretend their decade didn't end around 1984-'85, when U.K. new pop conquered the world and went phfft. But the best-of proves it. First side's all anyone needs of the brightly tuneful meaninglessness that made them video stars, and after side two cut one, ""The Reflex,"" they sink into an anonymity relieved only by the greatest record they never made, Nile Rodgers's ""Notorious,"" and the softcore closer ""All She Wants."" Sometimes I think the little girls don't understand a damn thing.

FALSE,B-,Lord Upminster,Ian Dury,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4697,"
""Spasticus Autisticus"" is every bit as startling as Dury must have hoped after Laughter got lost in the hustle, but on the rest of his major-label move he sounds like a retired ad man. I suppose the idea is to let the riddims of Steve Stanley, Chaz Jankel, and Sly &amp; Robbie turn jingles into rallying cries, but how much human kindness can you sell with slogans like ""escape is a jape""?
"
FALSE,B-,Desire,Bob Dylan,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=373,"
In the great tradition of Grand Funk Railroad, Dylan has made an album beloved by tour devotees--including those who were shut out of Rolling Thunder's pseudocommunitarian grooviness except via the press. It is not beloved by me. Although the candid propaganda and wily musicality of ""Hurricane"" delighted me for a long time, the deceitful bathos of its companion piece, ""Joey,"" tempts me to question the unsullied innocence of Rubin Carter himself. These are not protest songs, folks, not in the little-people tradition of ""Hattie Carroll""; their beneficiaries are (theoretically) wronged heroes, oppressed overdogs not unlike our beleaguered superstar himself. And despite his show of openness, our superstar may be feeling oppressed. His voice sounds viscous and so do his rhymes, while sisters Ronee and Emmylou sound distinctly kid, following the leader as if they're holding onto his index finger. More genuinely fraternal (and redeeming) are the pained, passionate marital tributes, ""Sara"" and ""Isis.""
"
FALSE,B-,Hard Rain,Bob Dylan,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6758,"
The only reason people are disgusted with this record is that they're sick of Dylan--which is understandable, but unfair to the record. The palookas who backed him on this tour sure ain't the Band, and the music and arrangements suffer accordingly--these guys are folkies whose idea of rock and roll is rock and roll clich������������������s. But the material i""Oh Sister"" and ""Shelter From the Storm""--Dylan sings very well indeed.
"
FALSE,B-,Shot of Love,Bob Dylan,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4699,"
Dylan's abandonment of Muscle Shoals for the fleshpots of El Lay--Benmont Tench! Ron Wood! Ringo Starr on tom tom!--has a reassuring aura of apostasy, which may be why I think this year's born-again boilerplate ""sounds better"" than last year's. But two songs that belong in the lower reaches of his canon don't hurt. ""Property of Jesus,"" about how bad it is to mock born-againers, has Staple Singers written all over it. ""Lenny Bruce"" is apostasy down to its reverent setting.
"
FALSE,B-,Infidels,Bob Dylan,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4700,"
All the wonted care Dylan has put into this album shows--musically, ""License to Kill"" is the only dud. His distaste for the daughters of Satan has gained complexity of tone--neither dismissive nor vituperative, he addresses women with a solicitousness that's strangely chilling, as if he knows what a self-serving hypocrite he's being, but only subliminally. At times I even feel sorry for him, just as he intends. Nevertheless, this man has turned into a hateful crackpot. Worse than his equation of Jews with Zionists with the Likud or his utterly muddled disquisition on international labor is the ital Hasidism that inspires no less than three superstitious attacks on space travel. God knows (and I use that phrase advisedly) how far off the deep end he'll go if John Glenn becomes president.

I admit it--this made my A shelves after the Bellamy Brothers softened me up. But that was unjust to the Bellamy Brothers. The Eagles are slimy not smarmy, pulchritudinous not purty, multiplatinum titans not singles artists, pretentious cynics not small-time con men, Topanga Canyon not San Fernando Valley. Sure their tunesmanship, zeitgeistheit, and guitar goodies were fun on the radio. But the next time I weeded my shelves, they were tracked to the reference collection.
"
FALSE,B-,Head to the Sky,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6769,"
In the beginning Maurice White created Hummit Music. But not until the morning of the fourth album did he come up with a tune to match, complete with sweet clear harmonies and sinuous beat. Catchy title, too: ""Evil,"" to be dispersed by prayer. Most of the first side keeps up the good work, although only rarely--as on the falsetto climax of ""Keep Your Head to the Sky""--is it quite as transcendent physically as the lyrics would seem to demand. But the mood jazz excursion on side two exposes White's essential fatuousness. ""Zanzibar,"" it's called, as befits a travelogue; its saxophone solo (by Ronnie Laws's replacement, Andrew Woolfolks) could make Alice Coltrane blush.
"
FALSE,B-,Life on the Line,Eddie and the Hot Rods,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6773,"
I'm not inclined to get judgmental here. It's true that Eddie's sunlamp tan and health-club bod make him the logical successor to Shaun Cassidy. True too that the teen-militant lyrics are strictly rote, and that their hooks hardly compare with Mann &amp; Weil's. Still, this is quite a bit solider than any album Paul Revere and the Raiders or the Dave Clark Five ever made--not counting greatest hits collections, of course.
"
FALSE,B-,Information,Dave Edmunds,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4724,"
Not since the onset of a career always marked by consistent taste and uncertain utility has Edmunds strayed so far from the trad, and though his perfidy/courage is characteristically marginal, it's still a mistake. The two Jeff Lynne-produced tracks have given him the hit he needs, but where 1971's echoey ""I Hear You Knockin'"" was a departure, 1983's teched-up ""Slipping Away"" is an accommodation to marketing trends the Edmunds of Rockpile bucked. And as a symptom of his faltering commitment, the songs he's selected for side two are quite humdrum, which isn't characteristic at all.
"
FALSE,B-,New York at Dawn,Elbow Bones and the Racketeers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4728,"
With a new Dr. Buzzard in the works and Kid Creole still August Darnell's principal outlet, it's amazing that he's found time and songs for yet another project--or so I thought until I heard the project. Only the declaration of infidelity ""Other Guys"" is more than a skillful black-music genre exercise, and though other singers might pull it out, Gichy Dan and Stephanie Fuller don't.
"
FALSE,B-,No Answer,Electric Light Orchestra,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6778,"
In which Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne work out their obsession with celli, French horns, and such like. The result is crude chamber music in rock time--pretty tuneful, and sometimes pretty funny as it lumbers along. Might even get interesting if Wood and Lynne weren't also working out their obsession with suffering ladies. Though they do OK by suffering men.

I've been trying to figure out why this group doesn't quite make it for six months, and I've finally hit on it--they don't write good songs. Also, Stan Bronstein sings as if the Establishment was stepping on his foot.
"
FALSE,B-,The Eleventh House Featuring Larry Coryell,The Eleventh House Featuring Larry Coryell,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6783,"
In person, Coryell's restless imagination has held its own against Alphonse Mouzon's cute Latin funkisms and Randy Brecker's plasma, perspiration, and lachrymal secretions. In fact, I've found the synthesis hard and multilayered--but maybe it was just loud. Here the guitarist's straining electronicism is subsumed in neat melodic contrivances. Depressing--when somebody deserves better for as long as Coryell, you begin to wonder.
"
FALSE,B-,Lorraine Ellison,Lorraine Ellison,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6784,"
Ellison's voice is so gorgeous and her spirit so possessed that it's hard to hear exactly what she's singing--you're riveted as she swoops over Ted Templeman's stark, gospel-drenched production, but nothing attaches itself permanently. Doesn't help that sometimes the swoop becomes a shriek, either.
"
FALSE,B-,Movin' Up,The Elvis Brothers,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4730,"
If you're really committed to the ""fun"" only unpretentious pop can provide, you might as well go directly to these proud posers, who generate hooks in an abundance that will shame whatever ""authentic"" locals you retain a sentimental yen for. Connoisseurs of pop plasticity will get an additional kick out of how affectlessly they shift from the usual ersatz teen romance to equally meaningless and equally commercial outlaw and rebel themes. Plus an uncanny Beatle impression on ""It's So Hard.""
"
FALSE,B-,Dig All Night,Joe Ely,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4733,"
Not one track runs under four minutes. Not one reveals why he was ever mistaken for country. Not one was written by Butch Hancock, by anybody but Joe--though he did get help on the title tune, which suggests a self-knowledge otherwise in retreat.

FALSE,B-,Relapse,Eminem,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14577,"
As he told ""XXL"": ""I wanted to go back to Proof's idea of, 'Let's just say the most f*cked up sh*t we can say.'"" In other words, this great artist's big concept for his first album since 2004 is a D12 homage. Having slyly categorized it as horrorcore early on, and riding Dr. Dre's most bombastic beats ever, he unrolls the offensive work of art bluenoses have always insisted was there: misogyny up the wazoo, lesbians-only homophobia, libels for a stepdad, murders unnumbered, sexual humiliations previously unknown to hip-hop and more dropped names than Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, who's funnier--and also, uh-oh, more boyish. In a socially redeeming denouement, all of this and more is blamed on the drugs we hope he's kicked, we really do. There's even an inspirational number no more boring than the one about offing Lindsay Lohan. But for the first time in his career Eminem settles for sensationalism straight up, and, worse still, makes you wonder whether he ever truly knew the difference. Em, this is not a Slim Shady album. Slim Shady had a lightness about him.

FALSE,B-,EV3,En Vogue,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5218,"
Sylvia Rhone isn't going to pull the plug on her copyright just because Dawn Robinson has decided she's the reason for her own success. So with yeomanlike help from Babyface, the label has laboriously extracted a hit and some platinum from Rhone's three remaining charges as they strain for soul and funk as stagily and dutifully as the fabricated bevy of talent-hunt beauties they've always been. Sole exception: the Robinson-led Set It Off smash ""Don't Let Go (Love)."" There's a lesson in that, right? Only what will that lesson be when Robinson's debut does the dog?

FALSE,B-,The Firm -- The Album,"Nas Escobar, Foxy Brown, Az and Nature",1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5203,"
After honoring Bernard Herrmann with some keyb-simulated RZA, Dre recedes (none too soon) and the music spares out--Wasis Diop kora sample today, mbira tomorrow. Foxy's pussycentrism gives the finger to the funniest male orgasm on record. And black Mafia fantasies threaten white male corporate oppression. (Just kidding.)
"
FALSE,B-,Fallen,Evanescence,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12199,"
The one and only rock breakthrough of this disastrous year is less dire than you'd think. They're Christians, but goth-metal Christians. I mean they're goth-metal, but goth-metal Christians. I mean they're Christians who told a webzine that ""the world is filled with hateful people who parade the name of Christ like a badge that grants them immunity to destroy anyone that disagrees with them,"" celebrated their megahit debut with Dom Perignon, and were yanked from Bible stores for using bad words in Entertainment Weekly. Their faith, as embodied in Amy Lee's clarion sopralto, lends their goth-metal a palpable sweetness. Now if only it wasn't goth-metal at all.
"
FALSE,B-,Reunion Concert,The Everly Brothers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4750,"
They were a vital team right up to Roots in 1968, but then they lost it, which was perhaps a cause of their estrangement, perhaps a result, or perhaps mere entropy. This 1983 gig was their first in ten years, and they sure didn't slough it off. But it's nostalgia anyway, adding nothing but a pushy drummer and a slight slackening of the voices to a superb body of work available in better record stores everywhere.
"
FALSE,B-,Exposure,Expos,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4755,"
This paints its frontwomen a blank beige so as not to distract from the electrobeats, which it mixes high and clear enough to deliver three dancy hits and set up the platinum-plated schlockaballad ""Seasons Change."" Smart shoppers will note that the ""Seasons Change"" 12-inch features a 10-minute megamix of said hits, then learn that the megamix isn't quite long enough--the thrill of a great electrobeat is having it ravish you again after you thought you'd had your fill. Damn bizzers nail you coming and going.
"
FALSE,B-,Tuff Enuff,The Fabulous Thunderbirds,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4757,"
The groove's tough enough, but like their fellow retroists the Bangles they don't write 'em as good as they pick 'em. This is the wages of retro--trying to replicate the musical spirit of a time that's passed means going against history and sacrificing the authenticity retroists live for. Can't blame Dave Edmunds for that. Or for the video, either.
"
FALSE,B-,Liege and Lief,Fairport Convention,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1224,"
Because the rhythm section has oomph and the singer soul, their pursuit of the Pentangle down the wooded path of jigs and ballads isn't entirely disastrous. But it sounds more like liege than lief to me. Traditional or original, these songs are either momentary escapes--that is, dances--or tales of common folk battling fate and the class system to something less than a standoff. Matty Groves outfucks Lord Donald, but Lord Donald kills Matty as well as his own wife; the Deserter is betrayed by comrade and sweetheart, then saved--to be a soldier--by Prince Albert. And the music, inevitably, reflects this fatalism.
"
FALSE,B-,To Be a Lover,George Faith,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6799,"
I know, you love (and miss) soul music so much you don't care if it's deprived of its cultural context--when you got what it takes you hold on to what you got, right? Well, I don't know. Faith is a soft-sung reggae stylist vaguely reminiscent of early Joe Simon or some small part of David Ruffin. He writes ordinary songs and executes a delightful segue from ""In the Midnight Hour"" to ""Ya Ya."" And he lets you know why he loves ""Turn Back the Hands of Time"" and ""So Fine"" by covering Paul Anka's ""Diana"" along with them.
"
FALSE,B-,Blazing Away,Marianne Faithfull,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2252,"
Already too damn significant for her own good, the diva-elect displays herself and her tattered repertoire to an adoring St. Anne's claque and gets little help from a band that should know better. I could go back to the disastrous video (shots of microphone bases for variety, pans of stained-glass windows for edification, slo-mo birds for filmpoetry) to make sure that's partner-in-cultdom Barry Reynolds on guitar overkill, not wizard-for-hire Marc Ribot. But since it's definitely Ribot's pal Dougie Bowne laying on the drumrolls, I'd rather not know. Either way the misbegotten strategy is to ratchet up the melodrama until only a cad would deny's she's suffering--and not just because she's worried sick about having to pull this act off forever amen.
"
FALSE,B-,The Real Thing,Faith No More,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1227,"
With rap, funk, hardcore, and falafel-joint rai seasoning their metallic stew, a new front man thinks hard about life and horror comics while under the influence of I hate to think what. ""Epic,"" which old people will think is about the terrors of sex though it's really about the terrors of everything, and ""Zombie Eaters,"" a jaundiced if not jealous view of a baby's world, delineate their generational chauvinism, and art-AOR keybs establish the depths of their cultural deprivation. Not as stupid as they sound--but do they sound stupid.
"
FALSE,B-,Perverted by Language,The Fall,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4762,"
New members, even female ones, aren't news with this group, but Mark E.'s guitarist wife Brixe Smith does lend his poetry readings apparent direction. The appearance is created by side-openers that go on so long you don't really notice your attention flagging as their momentum gives way to, well, poetry readings--roughly accompanied, as usual.
"
FALSE,B-,Folie ��,Fall Out Boy,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14385,"
Admittedly, the two classic lines Pete Wentz comes up with here--""Imperfect boys with their perfect lives"" and the cheeky Nirvana cop ""I don't care what you think as long as it's about me""--reflect the new thematic legitimacy of superstar self-pity in an era when fans would rather envy their musical heroes than identify with them. But that doesn't mean non-fans should feel obliged to get with the program. Low-tune for a pop band, low-momentum for a rock band, they stand a chance of evoking bad Elvis Costello when they take you by surprise or emote on in the background. In fact, when Mr. C. himself makes a shock-horror guest appearance, he's surprisingly hard to tell from Patrick Stumpf. Which is weird, disturbing--especially for Mr. C.
"
FALSE,B-,Fanny Hill,Fanny,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6808,"
Three albums in not much over a year is two too many, and though half the new material is catchy enough, they give themselves away by opening sides with Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't That Peculiar"" and the Beatles' ""Hey Bulldog."" Several lyrics do groundwork in important women's themes (autonomy, motherhood, like that), but not one--not even ""Wonderful Feeling,"" a disarmingly happy-sounding breakup song--offers the kind of concentrated perception that makes a song work or the kind of ""Charity Ball"" hook that makes you stop wondering whether a song is working.
"
FALSE,B-,The Question Is No,The Fastbacks,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6278,"
For all its sectarianism, one thing alt-rock produces in superfluity is nice guys--nice guys in nice bands. They're friendly and articulate, they support their scenes, they make music for love. Most likely their music ain't half bad, either. But seldom is it capable of signifying beyond the one-on-one club-circuit ambit. Such bands are praised beyond all reason by the fans they've served so faithfully for so long. In New York the prototype is Tara Key and Tim Harris's Antietam; in Seattle it's this Kurt Bloch-Kim Warnick unit. As you may have read, they're down-to-earth and pop-punky, the very model of a garage band for everyday use. Warnick sounds so sensible you'd loan her your car. And yes, some of Bloch's tunes will get her around the block. But unless you've seen them a few times, or Warnick's honest voice happens to activate your body chemistry, you'll struggle to penetrate the hoopla and then forget you own it.

FALSE,B-,Swamp Gold,Freddy Fender,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11384,"
There are 15 songs here, most of them, from what I read on the back cover, originally hits for producer Huey P. Meaux, who loves Freddy almost as much as he loves his own catalogue. Nice idea. But Freddy's chronic case of hit-or-miss disease is unaffected by this treatment--of the four cuts I'd consider for the Real Best of Freddy cassette I'm going to compile some day, three do not seem to belong to Meaux.

Sure ""Make believing is the real thing."" When Ferry is grooving, though, the emphasis is on the make-believe, not the real. Here there's heavy slippage, especially on side one. His voice thicker and more mucous, his tempos dragging despite all the fancy beats he's bought, he runs an ever steeper risk of turning into the romantic obsessive he's always played so zealously.

FALSE,B-,Mr. Look So Good,"Richard ""Dimples"" Fields",1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4783,"
Aware that Fields brought something quite his own to the soul/r&amp;b heritage, I wondered why his buttery come-on never moved me. Reason's simple--he's as egoistic and ultimately lightweight as James Taylor, another traditionalist original. Dissecting women with a butcher's eye one minute and quoting Biblical prophecy the next, he persuades me of neither his essential goodness nor his essential badness. I've got nothing against the combination, either--just ask Marvin Gaye, who works at least as hard at it as Fields, or Al Green, who doesn't.

What is this I hear? Some kind of weird cross between the Grateful Dead and the Velvet Underground making its own record in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio? No, that's not what I hear, but the description will have to do until the group comes up with another album--which I hope will feature more public lyrics and a drummer who can propagate the polyrhythms.

I do too pay attention to mainstream rock product: in fact, I listened to this five or six times without a trace of stomach upset. The group achieves more of that old CSN(Y) feel than any of the decade's country-rock spinoffs; the album achieves more of that old rock and roll feel than any of the decade's CSN(Y) records. Commendable if not quite recommendable--didn't think they had it in them.

This LP concentrates on what Firesign does best--turning tolerant radio chitchat into a horror show. But the edge is off their discovery--the details change but the perception itself seems stagnant. For followers only.

Last time they looked like sons of P-Funk and sounded like sons of Frank Yankovic's dotage, which suggested their stock in trade was cognitive dissonance. This time they look like 2-Tone fashion plates and sound like big-time new wave satirists, which suggests their stock in trade is haircuts. Uniting the two phases is their sense of rhythm or lack of same.

In the late '60s they harked back to the late '50s; now, to borrow their title, they hark back to the middle '60s. Pretty hookily, too, though I don't get why the vocals are so ragged. And where (or when) will they be in 2001? Now?

FALSE,B-,Heroes Are Hard to Find,Fleetwood Mac,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6830,"
The proof that their formula has finally trapped them is the pitifulness of their attempts to escape--with string synthesizer, pedal steel, half-assed horns, and other catch-22s of the International Pop Music Community. Bob Welch sounds bored, which is certainly poetic justice, and even Christine McVie is less than perfect this time out. Their worst.

I didn't believe they were nothing but a party until I witnessed them leap out on the NYU stage tossing packs of Camels to the mob, then demolish Nervus Rex in a battle of the bands. And from these five songs you still won't believe it. Best but not great is ""The Girl From Baltimore""--real party city, cross between Philly and D.C., none of which the song implies. Nervus Rex album's pretty nice.

Fun is a fine principle, but it works better when you start with the fun than when you start with the principle, which is why so much theoretically unpretentious rock and roll sounds forced anyway. Gets harder with every album, too. This is number three.

FALSE,B-,Close Up the Honky Tonks,The Flying Burrito Brothers,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6833,"
This repackaged best-of-Gram is baited with five previously unreleased Parsons vocals. These are nice, but since even an unreconstructed Parsons nut like me can reel off more interesting cover versions of ""Sing Me Back Home"" (the Everlys), ""Break My Mind"" (the Box Tops), and ""To Love Somebody"" (initials: JJ), maybe they were unreleased for a reason. It also puts the six greatest cuts off Gilded Palace of Sin on one side, a convenience I'd appreciate more if Gilded Palace of Sin, the only full-fledged country-rock masterpiece, weren't still in the catalogue. Your local record retailer will no doubt order you one if you take the trouble of kidnapping his children.

Conceived in memory of Chuck Berry when Kim Simmonds began handing out Kenny Burrell chord books to his Savoy Brown cohorts in 1970, this band has taken a good idea way too far. Rod Price's ubiquitous slide and Dave Peverett's iniquitous rave are decent trademarks, but energized becomes enervating in the absence of dynamic changes. Is good competent rock really good and competent if its excitement never transcends the mechanical? Is that what getting off means? So maybe they're not good and competent.

John Simon's settings go every which way--from Muscle Shoals to Kingston, from country to folk to r&amp;b--but always seem to come up pop. Then again, what else do you do with Forbert? He's as all-American as the Band, but beyond that catchy young heartland-soulful voice he has no musical identity: his lyrics are omniverously observant, but beyond an attractive all-purpose compassion they never reveal a point of view either. Steve Forbert Reporting, that's all. Which means you have to care about him as much as he does--""Make It All So Real"" is as shameless as the suffering-artist theme gets--to care about his songs. And the voice doesn't do that for me.

I knew he was the son of Los Van Van's big man first time I played his blandly pretty folk-jazz and chalked its bloodlessness to the suburban New Age crap first harbingered when Kenny Rankin discovered chromatic chords in Marin County 30 years ago. Not until later did I read that the younger Formell had ""literally re-defined the concept of Cuban music,"" only the Commies wouldn't let him so he went into exile, only then he suffered ""rejection"" ""in some communities here in America too."" Self-pity being folk music's universal solvent, my own suspicion is that said communities, if they exist at all, didn't like his clave. Really, JC--I don't care whether you like Castro. I'm a major El Duque fan. I just think you're a wimp.

Not hard to hear why he wanted out of Humble Pie--with his pretty guitar and air of abstracted yearning, the boy's almost a ringer for Dave Mason. He's equally tuneful, vague, and confused about women (""I wasn't made to do no cooking""?). The difference is that Mason would never cover ""Jumping Jack Flash."" But if he did he'd take it at the same insipidly insinuating tempo.

Peter F. is rocking harder, probably because the above-mentioned Camel is a regular touring unit. He's writing fewer catchy tunes, probably because the abovementioned Camel is a regular touring unit. He dedicates a song to his manager, probably because the abovementioned Camel is a regular touring unit. He identifies white sugar as evil, probably because he's into health food.

In which she rejects the producers who made her career for Quincy Jones and drifts off into the hey now hey with rudder trailing. ""So Swell When You're Well"" and ""Sister From Texas"" might sneak onto Spirit in the Dark with a little more funk, and ""Just Right Tonight"" busies itself nicely, but too much of this is pretentious baloney, and ""Somewhere"" and ""Mister Spain"" are horrid.

Yes, there are bright spots--a funk trifle with Re on piano, an autobiographical reminiscence speeded up Vegas-style, her voice. But the guidance she gets from new corporate mentor Clive Davis is typified by the vamp she adds to ""What a Fool Believes."" ""Get the funk, get it now,"" she murmurs valiantly over a rhythm section anchored, as they say, by Louis Johnson and Jeff Porcaro. And who do you think plays the sax outro? If you guessed David Sanborn you get the picture. [Catalogue number: AL 9358.]

FALSE,B-,"Oh, My God!",Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4821,"
With the outrageous anticrime message of ""Nuthin'"" and the star-time joyride of ""Lovin' Every Minute of It"" surrounding his Big Hit, I'd call this a one-sided album if I wanted to be kind. But I don't, not when he dedicates it to G-O-D in the absence of Slick Rick and informs the ladies in the house that abortion (rhymes with mind distortion) is of ""the devil."" Buy the single, which doesn't put the Supreme Being so high in the mix. Inspiration Verse: ""Cause I'm like Moses, no one knows this/The way I dress and my lifestyle shows this.""

He tells us right off that he's got ""a rich man's dream"" and ""a poor man's needs""; in other words, he's got the soul of a middle-class kid who hopes he's hitbound and doesn't have the faintest idea what rich men dream about. Hitbound he may be--this is replete with nice reflections nicely melodized. But only once, on the transcendent ""Ariel,"" does he sound as cute as he wants to.

Jazz sophisticates who long ago followed Frisell into the fog won't gainsay his groove at this late date. Swing isn't on his product list, and as for swing's West African or Brazilian equivalents, isn't that what now-Parisian percussionist Sidiki Camara and now-New York guitarist Vinicius Cantu������������������ria are on board for? Hardly. They're there for color. Frisell cares about color the way Sigur R������������������s cares about color, and if his hues are somewhat brighter, he doesn't have Iceland f""world music""--articulated rhythm.

"
FALSE,B-,Official Version,Front 242,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4828,"
This Belgian bund's bad reputation isn't a simple function of safe-and-saners' deplorable tendency to brand powerful art they don't like fascist (viz. Albert Goldman on the Rolling Stones, 1969). In a time that demands consciousness, mobilization, taking sides, apolitical objectivism is objectively, comme on dit, reactionary. But with their stated aim of transforming received information into powerful aural images, they're aggressive-passive as opposed to passive-aggressive. The worst you could say of them is that they'd try to make their way no mater who took over--and become antifascist six months too late. As far as they're concerned, of course, the worst you could say of them is that their club and cult hits ""Masterhit"" and ""Quite Unusual"" don't exactly carpet-bomb the sensorium. But they don't. You've heard of preaching to the converted? These guys shoot the executed.

Could it be that these impassive disco powermongers are the latest in the long line of European rockers who have symphonic grandeur so deep in their bones that they believe they can reach the, er, masses with it?

Beats being what they are to street music, these guys were the brains as well as the muscle behind the two most unstoppable street records of the year, and a major-label debut is their reward. Good beats abound, of course, and with the help of major muscle one of the great ones--if not ""Alice, I Want You Just for Me!"" maybe ""Half a Chance""--might make it down to the streets. But like the seduction manuals say, brains and muscle combined have nothing on personality.

FALSE,B-,Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow,Funkadelic,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1303,"
This is as confusing and promising and ultimately ambiguous as the catchy (and rhythmic) title slogan. Is that ass as in ""shake your ass"" or ass as in ""save your ass""?  And does one escape/transcend the dollar by renouncing the material world or by accepting one's lot? Similarly, are the scratchy organ timbres and disorienting separations fuckups or deliberate alienation effects? Is this music to stand to or music to get wasted by? In short, is this band (this black band, I should add, since it's black people who are most victimized by antimaterialist rhetoric) promulgating escapist idealism or psychic liberation? Or do all these antinomies merely precede some aesthetic synthesis? One thing is certain--the only place that synthesis might occur here is on ""Funky Dollar Bill.""
"
FALSE,B-,Peter Gabriel,Peter Gabriel,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6878,"
One of those records that is diminished by the printed lyrics that are its reason for being. Musically, Gabriel combines with producer Robert Fripp for alert art-rock that gets down around atonality rather than jumping into the astral-noodle soup, with Roy Bittan's romantic flourishes as welcome as ""D.I.Y.,"" a hard-rock landmark in a hard-rock year. But even though it makes you sit up when it comes on the radio, it's basically program music, designed to support words as elitist (and programmatic) as the social commentary Gabriel used to essay in his Genesis days. Remember the immortal words of Chuck Berry: beware of middlebrows bearing electric guitars.
"
FALSE,B-,Peter Gabriel,Peter Gabriel,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6879,"
After hitting a sophomore jinx with Peter Gabriel, on Atlantic, the first man of Genesis fulfills the promise of Peter Gabriel, on Atco--with pessimistic postprog art-rock minidrama rather than DIY DOR. ""Games Without Frontiers,"" a different kind of internationalism, and ""Biko,"" a different kind of Africanism, lead and finish side two rather than side one. Either he doesn't know his own strengths or he underestimates his audience--or both.
"
FALSE,B-,So,Peter Gabriel,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2736,"
Gabriel's so smart he knows rhythm is what makes music go, which relieves him of humdrum melodic responsibilities but doesn't get him up on the one--smart guys do go for texture in a pinch. Like his smart predecessor James Taylor, who used to climax concerts with the clever macho parody ""Steamroller,"" this supporter of good causes reaches the masses with ""Sledgehammer,"" which is no parody. Where is ""Biko"" now that we need it more than ever?
"
FALSE,B-,US,Peter Gabriel,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5875,"
His voice permanently hoarse--sounds like he's been campaigning for president since he dropped So in 1986, which in a sense he has--Gabriel deploys a multihued battalion of respected professionals into wave upon wave of overkill. Though the sonic layering isn't devoid of interest or even originality, the problem goes way beyond a grandeur that seems inauspiciously egotistical on ""his first real record of love songs""--these arrangements would obtrude into any musical event more low-key than an Olympic anthem or a massed May Day choir singing ""The Internationale."" ""Steam""'s googolgroove overwhelms its petty sexism, but ""Kiss That Frog"" wrecks a funny little idea about Pete's penis by asking it to hold up the weight of the world. And ""Kiss That Frog"" is the other fast one, plus one makes two. What you mean US, white man?

Look, all you young white people, I know fate has dealt you a shitty hand. Rent stabilization is a joke, safe sex isn't a joke, pollutants can really get you down, and forget the economy. Not to mention the decline of civility on our city streets. So if you just want to sit around and mope about it to each other, we understand. But if you're looking for a helping hand, you're going to have to reach out a little yourselves--that's just human nature. Show some get-up-and-go, crack a few jokes, like on the first song.

FALSE,B-,Garcia,Jerry Garcia,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6882,"
Garcia's willingness to strain his stringy pipes on muscular material may be a function of karmic complacency, but that doesn't mean he can't sing. His voice is as expressive as Lou Reed's or Donald Fagen's and more credible than Ry Cooder's or Robert Hunter's. The first side of this plumbs lyrics by Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, and Irving Berlin that you may never have noticed before, and Garcia's guitar spruces up the somewhat limp backing of the Marin County All-Stars. On side two, unfortunately, some other Marin County all-stars contribute songs that need another kind of plumbing.

Even though it omitted ""Inner City Blues"" while offering ""How Sweet It Is"" and ""Can I Get a Witness"" (already included on four other Marvin Gaye compilations and who knows how many Motown anthologies), I thought this might serve a function, since I find all of Gaye's '70s albums except Let's Get It On distressingly uneven. But ""I Want You,"" ""After the Dance,"" and the live version of ""Distant Lover"" are embarrassed by such stellar company. I guess when I want to hear ""Trouble Man"" I'll put on Anthology.

FALSE,B-,Marvin Gaye Live at the London Palladium,Marvin Gaye,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2284,"
Especially considering how awkward Gaye can be on stage, this isn't bad for a live Motown album--the arrangements are finky, but some of Marvin's more interesting vocal quirks seem to have survived editing. Which is not to suggest that the live stuff is worth owning. ""Got To Give It Up,"" on the other hand, is his quadrennial studio masterpiece, and its 11:48 are cut up on the single. Still, I think the single is what I'd buy--while petitioning for a disco disc.

FALSE,B-,You're Gettin' Even While I'm Gettin' Odd,The J. Geils Band,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4863,"
This has always been an unnecessarily obvious pop group, and while fill-in vocalists Seth Justman and Stephen Bladd eschew illusions of grandeur, they're neither gifted nor skilled enough to dance that nuance. And so the hooks pound on, making the wordplay in the sex lyrics seem unnecessarily salacious and the poetry in the political lyrics seem unnecessarily overwrought.
"
FALSE,B-,All the Rage,General Public,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8232,"
Songcraft notwithstanding, I find that the (English) Beat's (debut) ska and (follow-up) panafrobeat albums wear better than their (farewell) pop album, and I'm sorry to report that Dave Wakeling's and Ranking Roger's new group turn a tendency into an avalanche. Although they've managed a unique sound within current English pop fashion, which makes do with unintrusive dance grooves instead of beat and melody, they don't break out of its rut. Their new rhythm section is no more an improvement on David Steele and Everett Martin than Wesley Magoogan was on Saxa. They place too much weight on lyrics that even when they escape modern romance simply don't deconstruct clich�����������""As a Matter of Fact""). And the breathy expressionism of their vocals is fast evolving into affectation.

FALSE,B-,The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,Genesis,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6905,"
I wanted to call this the most readable album since Quadrophenia, but it's only the wordiest--two inner sleeves covered with lyrics and a double-fold that's all small-type libretto. The apparent subject is the symbolic quest of a Puerto Rican hood/street kid/graffiti artist named Rael, but the songs neither shine by themselves nor suggest any thematic insight I'm eager to pursue. For art-rock, though, it's listenable, from Eno treatments to a hook that goes (I'm humming) ""on Braw-aw-aw-aw-aw-aw-dway.""

FALSE,B-,The Geto Boys,The Geto Boys,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5844,"
I accept the slasher-movie defense in re the racism (and antirockism) of all attempts to stop these putative tough guys from bum-rushing the marketplace. But aesthetically the analogy is null, because slasher movies suck--exploiting and exacerbating rather than ""revealing"" or ""catharsizing,"" they're a social pathology, period. So whether the Boys are expressing their inner natures or one-upping N.W.A. and 2 Live Crew, they're sick motherfuckers. Women get offed before or during sex in three different songs, one of which runs a chorus of ""Geto Boys, Geto Boys"" in back lest the misguided distance it too far from its perps, and if the merely brutal ""Gangster of Love"" isn't about their own experiences, they don't want anybody to know it. I'm impressed by their pungent beats and vernacular. I'm glad they put Reagan in bed with Noriega. I'm sorta touched when one of them thinks to thank the first girl to lick his asshole. I admire their enunciation on ""F#@* 'Em."" But fuck 'em.

No longer deploying dolor for art points, Gibbons takes her aestheticism up an order of difficulty. From tasteful simplicity to dramatic vibrato to cracked slur to Badu-does-Holiday to ""water-coloured memories/Soft as a summer breeze"" to precision whisper to country-soul sincerity to loose-whisper-gets-busy to frail-drawl-achieves-grandeur to filtered weirdness to total mannered live bollocks of ""Candy Says,"" she and her hands-on arranger achieve whatever dramatic perspective they map out. But to what end? Gibbons's failure to leave the likes of ""And I only hear/Only hear the rain"" and ""Time is but a memory"" in her notebook suggests one limitation of her songcraft. But the selling point for her admirers is the deal breaker for me: a hard-earned refinement that by the nature of its ambition claims more universality than it has any right to.

If they hadn't covered ""My Way,"" maybe the one-worlder in me would adjust his horizons to embrace flamenco guitar and let the rest pass. But there it is, and don't riposte indignantly that ""My Way"" is a French song--that's the point. Their florid Andalusian emotionalism is Europop's cornball showbiz alternative to soul.

Bizzers will no doubt rend their overpriced garments when this fails to follow Beauty and the Beat into Platinum City, but all its failure will prove is that you can't build a wall of sound (much less an empire) out of tissue paper. The uniform thinness of the non-Kathy Valentine songs here does clear up the mystery of why virtual non-writer Belinda Carlisle gets to play frontwoman--her voice fits the image.

It was thankless enough conceptualizing arena-rock, so what gave Anton Fier the bright idea of adding country to the synthesis, as he probably calls it in the privacy of his own cerebration? Did he meet T-Bone Burnett at a party? Fight with Syd Straw about her roots? Or just think it would sell? Anton, get this straight: especially as you approach country, sincerity sells.

FALSE,B-,Wake of the Flood,Grateful Dead,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3644,"
Capturing that ruminative, seemingly aimless part of the concert when the boogiers nod out, which doesn't mean nothing is going on--what do the boogiers know by now? Musically, this is a deceptively demanding combination of American Beauty and Aoxomoxoa, sweet tunes mined for structure and texture--including good fiddle, which figures, and good horns, which doesn't. But the lyrics are more of the old karma-go-round, with barely a hook phrase to come away with. I remember Robert Hunter when he was making up American myths.
"
FALSE,B-,From the Mars Hotel,Grateful Dead,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6935,"
Brighter and more uptempo than Wake of the Flood (which is not to claim it's ""high energy""), with almost as many memorable tunes as American Beauty. Robert Hunter is not progressing, however--even ""U.S. Blues,"" an entertaining collection of conceits, seems received rather than found. And a Weir-Barlow song about money is just one more way for rich Marin hippies to put women down.
"
FALSE,B-,Drift Away,Dobie Gray,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6941,"
At times this long-lost '60s one-shot sounds like a black Joe Cocker--with the strain removed, naturally. His frank, unchurchy baritone works material from Nashville producer Mentor Williams for a universal country-rock whose racelessness is a real relief in a world of drawlers and twangers. But though the title hit sticks, I find its central conceit--rock and roll to soothe the soul--ultimately enervating. Enough to make me wish he's rejoin the in crowd, which after all is out by now.
"
FALSE,B-,Al Green,Al Green,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11479,"
If Al decides to turn into Otis Redding after all, we may look back at this repackaging of his earliest recordings as the beginning of a great stylist. If he decides to turn into Diana Ross, as seems at least possible, we will forget it quickly enough.
"
FALSE,B-,Love Ritual,Al Green,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6946,"
The only thing this product--compiled from his radically uneven later albums--teaches us about Green is why London left the title tune off Greatest Hits Volume II. Needed it for corporate revenge after Hi deserted the sinking ship.
"
FALSE,B-,Gas Food Lodging,Green on Red,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1457,"
They used to be fun, partly because you couldn't tell whether they knew how risibly their wacked-out postadolescent angst came across. So now they unveil their road/roots/maturity album, which extols heroic dreams and revives Americana--drunks, murderers, husbands who've ""passed away."" Fun it's not. And in addition to the melodies thinning out, as melodies will, the playing's somehow gotten sloppier.
"
FALSE,B-,The Last of the True Believers,Nanci Griffith,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2500,"
Among the signifiers jammed into the back-cover portrait are an acoustic guitar and a Larry McMurtry novel--not just a folkie, a literary folkie, from Texas, get it? Yes, we see. We see auburn hair in a French roll, white shawl thrown casually over antique flower-print dress, eyes demurely downcast. A mite precious, all told, with songs to match. Bet she reads Bobbie Ann Mason, too, but there's just no prose in her. What's amazing is that she almost gets away with it. On ""Lookin' for the Time (Workin' Girl),"" about a prostitute who can't afford a heart of gold, she does get away with it. I think it's the melody.
"
FALSE,B-,Gone Crazy,Grin,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6950,"
Didn't ""Beggar's Day"" sound better on Crazy Horse, and haven't we heard those girl-world boy-toy rhymes before? You bet. This is where Nils starts to repeat himself. Not only does the lack of a moderately interesting new lyric close off a source of pleasure, it also leaves Lofgren with nothing to sing about. Let's hope this was a rush job for his new label and warn him not to rush the next.
"
FALSE,B-,Wheatfield Soul,The Guess Who,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10839,"
This is a Winnipeg group that hit big with a white-soul ballad, ""These Eyes,"" which most of you probably hate. I love it. Nothing else on the lp is up to it, but except for one bummer cut (which of course runs over 10 minutes on the ""These Eyes"" side) it is well-played, well-sung, well-arranged, and personal without being push. Not to be confused with . . .
"
FALSE,B-,Bee Thousand,Guided by Voices,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1468,"
On most of these 20-tracks-in-36-minutes, the tunes emerge if you stick around, but they're undercut by multiple irritants. The lyrics are deliberately obscure, the structures deliberately foreshortened, the vocals a record collector's Anglophilia-in-the-shower; the rec-room production is so inconsistent you keep losing your bearings, as befits resident art-rock fan Robert Pollard's boast (which echoes Lou Barlow's, what a coincidence) that some recordings aren't just first takes but first plays, of songs he'd dreamed up since the last time the band came over. In short, this is pop for perverts--pomo smarty-pants too prudish and/or alienated to take their pleasure without a touch of pain to remind them that they're still alive.
"
FALSE,B-,Gun Sight,Gun,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11246,"
This unknown group has now released two albums which come very close to succeeding. The songs are excellent lyrically and the group's pretensions--which include background strings and jazz moves on top of a hard rock sound--usually work. But it never comes together, and my mixing expert informs me that the mix is muddy.
"
FALSE,B-,Appetite for Destruction,Guns N' Roses,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4904,"
It's a mug's game to deny the technical facility claimed by one-upping crits and young victims of testosterone poisoning--not only does Axl cruise where other ""hard rock"" singers strive, but he has a knack for believability, which in this genre is the most technical matter of all. When he melds scream and croon on the big-beat ballad, you understand why some confused young thing in an uplift bra is sure it's love sweet love. But Axl is a sucker for dark romantic abstractions--he doesn't love Night Train, he loves alcoholism. And once that sweet child o' his proves her devotion by sucking his cock for the portacam, the evil slut is ready for ""See me hit you you fall down.""
"
FALSE,B-,Alice's Restaurant,Arlo Guthrie,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10990,"
The only sin of the title tale is kindness, but even in that, Arlo presents a fetching argument for hippie unsentimentality--for he's also funny, sly, intensely moral, and quite unmoralistic. The six tunes on the other side aren't bad as tunes, but they were recorded before Arlo learned how to sing. One-sided masterpiece.
"
FALSE,B-,Washington County,Arlo Guthrie,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6958,"
Basically, Running Down the Road was about what it said it was about. As such, it was a little scary, which I liked but Arlo apparently didn't, because now he's busy finding ""a place to dwell"" and learning about Jesus. Or, to turn his only joke on this record around, putting his foot in his mouth and telling it where he wants to go. The Woody cover exposes the dark underside of cattle drives, but mostly it's roots and fenceposts--in short, the good earth. Which may be why he sounds sodden.
"
FALSE,B-,His Epic Hits--The First Eleven--To Be Continued . . .,Merle Haggard,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4914,"
Though at first this just seems sad, an objective person will admit that actually the songs are kind of memorable--in other words, not filler. He wrote most of them himself, too. But an objective person will also note that the two side-openers (and the two best tracks by a mile) both feature Willie Nelson. And wish he hadn't ruined a great stanza in ""My Favorite Memory"" with that stupid line about how she made their vacation a ball. And get kind of sick at the reactionary nostalgia of ""Are the Good Times Really Over."" And wonder whether Mrs. Hag really ended up in George Jones's bed like he claims in ""C.C. Waterback,"" and whether Hag minded, and if not why not. And get sad all over again.
"
FALSE,B-,Chill Factor,Merle Haggard,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4918,"
Supposedly a good one, and since it features an illustrated inner sleeve and six songs on one side that must be the intent. But by peaking with ""Thirty Again,"" all it proves is that his great theme is age rather than love, which of course dominates. Further proof includes the overtaxed title metaphor and a Hank Cochran copyright so bitter and direct it makes you think his women get sick of him for the simple reason that's he full of shit.
"
FALSE,B-,A Taste of Yesterday's Wine,Merle Haggard and George Jones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4912,"
What might have been a historic get-together overplays both the good-old-boy camaraderie and the cry-in-your-beer sentimentality of country's male-bonding mode. Willie Nelson's keynote tune becomes completely bathetic, and that the nostalgia and mutual self-congratulation it presages are even bearable is one more proof of Jones's genius.
"
FALSE,B-,The Band That Would Be King,Half Japanese,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1484,"
Just because Jad Fair is some kind of genius doesn't mean he benefits from the genius treatment--he needs a real producer forcing him to develop his material, not Kramer letting 'er rip. Most of these songlets--27 on vinyl, 30 on CD--go by so fast you don't notice them end, so that slow ones like ""Daytona Beach"" and ""Deadly Alien Spawn"" stand out. I bet if somebody made him sit down and work out extra verses, we'd know what the best fast ones were. Suggested pep talk: ""Think funny, Jad.""
"
FALSE,B-,Abandoned Luncheonette,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1487,"
This comes down to a nice equation of folk duo and soul falsetto group, brought together with the best vocal and production pyrotechnics a studio can afford. The music rocks with a smooth sophistication, although it can get sententious as well as popsy cute; the lyrics diagnose romantic malaise with clinical expertise and occasional acuity--""Everybody's high on consolation,"" perfect. If not too perfect.
"
FALSE,B-,H2O,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4925,"
The bristling hookcraft and fussy funk of their crossover has never been more unmistakable, and neither has its small-mindedness. Only ""One on One,"" the album's sole seduction song, breaks the waspish music into something bigger, and while their dispatches from the sex wars might gain heart if gender-reversed (women get partial lyric credit on no less than five of them) I just don't believe ""Maneater"" was conceived with Nona Hendryx in mind.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of George Harrison,George Harrison,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6986,"
Seven of George's Beatle songs on the A side, and while the titles are impressive--""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun"" no more than ""If I Needed Someone"" and ""Think for Yourself""--the voice begins to betray its weaknesses after a while, like a borderline hitter they can pitch around after the sluggers are traded away. The solo ""bests"" on the B are remarkably shoddy--if this is all he can manage over four LPs you wonder why he has a contract at all. (Wait, let me guess.)
"
FALSE,B-,Thirty-Three & 1/3,George Harrison,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6987,"
This isn't as worldly as George wants you to think--or as he thinks himself, for all I know--but it ain't fulla shit either. ""Crackerbox Palace"" is the best thing he's written since ""Here Comes the Sun"" (not counting ""Deep Blue,"" hidden away on the B side of ""Bangla-Desh,"" or--naughty, naughty--""My Sweet Lord""), and if ""This Song"" were on side two I might actually play the record again.
"
FALSE,B-,Cloud Nine,George Harrison,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4937,"
""Gettin' old as my mother,"" right on and why not. ""Feel more like Big Bill Broonzy,"" not so fast. For one thing, the Other Beatle should know better than to risk comparison with his betters. For another, he's not ready to settle for Broonzy's audience share.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989,George Harrison,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4938,"
A simpleton, but also a genuine weirdo. Voice doubles wah-wah as surely as Robert Plant's Jimmy Page impression, and he seems genuinely troubled by evil doings here on the wrong side of the veil of maya. Not that there's anything a mere star-in-spite-of-himself can do about it, except write the occasional ditty about playing in a rock and roll band.
"
FALSE,B-,KooKoo,Debbie Harry,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=989,"
Blondie plus Chic sounded like a natural--charming klutz confronts the meaning of grace. But in the world of surfaces that both inhabit so intensely there are no naturals, and the kind of spiritual heat that might have made the bond take is rare at any depth. Lots of sharp little moments are intermittently arresting, and if both artists establish themselves as classic the strain may sound noble eventually. Right now it sounds klutzy.

Hart played drums and wrote catchy tunes for a trio called H������������������sker D����������"
FALSE,B-,Flash of the Spirit,Jon Hassell/Farafina,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4941,"
The idea was for the exoticist to collaborate with flesh-and-blood ""traditional musicians,"" whatever that can mean in such a context. The result was to reduce Yurrup and Burkina Faso to a lowest common denominator--background music. Worse still, the aural environment neither flashes nor fuses--rather than a ""forced collision of cultures,"" it sounds like they just barely missed each other.
"
FALSE,B-,Brave New Girl,Bonnie Hayes and the Wild Combo,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4943,"
Her climactic love song is called ""Night Baseball,"" so obviously her tomboy credentials are in excellent order. Which come to think of it could be why the compassionate, catchy cool of her debut album has succumbed to the schlocky pop her (male, natch) musicians have a yen for.
"
FALSE,B-,Live at the Sahara,Isaac Hayes,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6995,"
I like Ike live because he makes fun of himself, but though I hear the patrons laughing I miss his turquoise tights. Can't even say I wish I'd been there--not in Tahoe, thanks. But the band is crisp and funky, and he does talk more on stage than on record if you can believe that, and I even find ""Rock Me Baby"" sexy myself. Not ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" though.
"
FALSE,B-,"Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs",Eddie Hazel,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1125,"
Hazel can really flick his pick, and maybe that's the problem: despite a welcome but misleading cover of ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and the assistance of his cohorts in the Funkadelic rhythm brigade, most of the time you'd think this was a David Spinozza record. Heavy it ain't.
"
FALSE,B-,Cowboy in Sweden,Lee Hazlewood,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2021,"
Hazlewood is an ""interesting"" figure, always was. A natural hipster, in the biz but not of it, pop and rock and country and just plain weird--Duane Eddy, Nancy Sinatra, and Gram Parsons is quite a trifecta. Problem is he'snever been all that good. There's a nice best-of hiding in his collected works, including the new standards collection. But his vogue transcends crass track-by-track quality controls, combining the usual convolutional one-upsmanship, a visceral distaste for roots-rock's sonic canon, and a generation of aging slackers' discovery that doing bizness needn't deaden your mind or rot your soul. If slick blues licks make you sick, Hazlewood's studio hacks and string-section dreck will be some kind of change. If you like Nancy Sinatra almost as much as Karen Carpenter, thin-piped Nina Lizell will clean away enough Janis-and-Bonnie grit. If you doubt all shows of soul, the flaccid sentimentality of ""Easy and Me"" will be one more trope as far as you're concerned. But without opening a book I can recall half a dozen unreissued singer-songwriter albums that do more with their varied conventions than this Europe-only 1970 rarity--by Thomas Jefferson Kaye, Nolan Porter, Marc Benno, Hirth Martinez, Alice Stuart, Mississippi Charles Bevel. And I shudder to think of the unreasonable claims to be made when their time comes around again.
"
FALSE,B-,Say It Ain't So,Murray Head,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11679,"
If mindless pap is your thing, this sure beats Eric Carmen. It's even slightly psychedoolic, and includes not a single Rachmaninoff cop. Hit single: ""Say It Ain't So Joe.""
"
FALSE,B-,No Talking Just Head,The Heads,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5933,"
Not as horrible as lead tracks fronted by the frontpersons of Concrete Blonde and INXS promise--in fact, once you forgive Johnette her pain, hers is actually OK. As is that of Live's Ed Kowalczyk, aping not R.E.M. or U2 but (what a dandy idea) Talking Heads, whose frontperson is otherwise much missed--for his personality, his lyrics, his inimitable guitar, his glue. Best in show: ""Punk Lolita,"" in which Tina, Chris, and Jerry back Tina, Debbie, and Johnette with results that recall no one so much as (what a dandy idea) Tom Tom Club.
"
FALSE,B-,Liquor in the Front,The Reverend Horton Heat,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5905,"
Not counting the belch-enhanced Scott Joplin closer, their best joke got lost on the way to the rack jobber: the title was Liquor in the Front, Poker in the Rear before somebody (the major label, mayhap?) took the punch line off the cover. This leaves us with a supposedly humorous male chauvinist trio playing rock-enhanced rockabilly Very Loud. College radio dogs find their mess authentic and postmodern all at once. Me, I listen in vain for a ""Dixie Fried,"" a ""One Hand Loose,"" even a ""Ubangi Stomp""--hell, even a ""Rock This Town,"" by the fabled and short-lived Stray Cats, who tried something similar in the dark ages of MTV.
"
FALSE,B-,Big Tyme,Heavy D & the Boyz,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4948,"
He's got a smooth, rhythmic delivery. He knows his beats and cliches, assigning Teddy and Marley to set the bait and his own DJ to pull in the lines. Although he doesn't always use his vocabulary very precisely and isn't above ""happy like a faggot in jail,"" he rarely pumps the boasts or sexism all the way to wack. He even samples Martin Luther King. In short, he knows the right people and does the right things. Which is never enough.
"
FALSE,B-,All in the Friendly Colours,Hedge & Donna,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10880,"
An engaging folk duo record. Includes a beautiful Jackson Browne, ""There Came a Question.""
"
FALSE,B-,The Essential Jimi Hendrix Volume Two,Jimi Hendrix,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7004,"
This one-LP follow-up surrounds the Band of Gypsys ""Machine Gun"" with the Monterey ""Wild Thing"" and the Woodstock ""Star Spangled Banner,"" a worthy conceit, and includes a seven-inch ""Gloria"" that lasts 8:47 and is spectacular for about a third of that. It also includes five whole tracks from Are You Experienced?
"
FALSE,B-,All of a Sudden,John Hiatt,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1780,"
Carpers have always claimed there was nothing underneath his gift for the hook, and now that Hiatt's finally gotten his big shot, on David G.'s label with David B.'s producer, he seems intent on proving it. Median cut length is up from 2:55 (on 1979's Slug Line) to 3:31, Tony Visconti has dehumanized Hiatt's uncommercial voice with filters that make him sound like a Hoosier Steve Strange, and even his cover photo has been reduced to benday dots. The veteran up-and-comer as overblown cynic.
"
FALSE,B-,Bring the Family,John Hiatt,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1783,"
""I don't think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever/Record this song,"" moans the wandering pro on the lead cut, which announces his intention to go get ""good and greasy"" in Memphis before subjecting himself to ""one more heartfelt steel guitar chord"" in the Music City he calls home. But now more than ever he seems to derive his idea of good and greasy from, I don't know, Joe Cocker, which only works when he makes nasty. Well-written though it may be, most of this is Ronnie Milsap's kind of thing.
"
FALSE,B-,It Happened One Bite,Dan Hicks,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7012,"
Hicks's songwriting is somewhat straightened (Joan Baez could do ""Cloud My Sunny Mood"" or ""Garden in the Rain"") but only slightly diminished on this 1975 soundtrack for an unreleased Ralph Bakshi movie (he sez). But for some reason it sounds a little . . . loud, even forceful. I should applaud this modernistic development, but instead I'm thinking that I'd rather hear Peter Stampfel (or R. Crumb) cover ""Mama, I'm an Outlaw.""
"
FALSE,B-,Very Extremely Dangerous,Eddie Hinton,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7014,"
Hinton's Otis Redding tribute goes far beyond anything ever attempted by Frankie Miller or Toots Hibbert--it's almost like one of those Elvis re-creations. The Muscle Shoals boys put out on backup, Hinton's songs are pretty good, and the man has the phrasing and the guttural inflections down pat. So what's missing is instructive: first, the richness of timbre that made Otis sound soft even at his raspiest, and second, good will so enormous that it overflowed naturally into a humor that hurt no one.
"
FALSE,B-,Words and Music by Bob Dylan,The Hollies,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11531,"
Graham Nash left the Hollies in principled opposition to this record. I fail to understand his fuss, unless he was worried about writing royalties. A good selection of Dylan songs done in a totally unexceptionable style. Anyone who likes the group will like this record.
"
FALSE,B-,Hollies,The Hollies,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7022,"
Hollies scholars herald Allan Clarke's homecoming as a return to form, but though the material is their most playful in years--the slyly circular ""Love Makes the World Go Round,"" the slyly hyperbolic ""Out on the Road""--the old lightness is gone, probably forever. I mean, soul is soul--at times the sham intensity here is almost baroque. We are not charmed.
"
FALSE,B-,Loleatta,Loleatta Holloway,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7023,"
Those craving a big-voiced r&amp;b singer should probably grab this rough-edged Philadelphia-type production. Those in control of their urges should note that nothing else on the album matches the lead cuts on each side, ""Hit and Run"" and ""Ripped Off.""
"
FALSE,B-,Rupert Holmes,Rupert Holmes,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7024,"
In another time this guy would be writing short stories for Collier's; if he really is a civilized Randy Newman, as some seem to feel, then the emphasis is on the civilized. The giveaway is the voice, devoid of feeling or even eccentricity, and hence inoffensive. Randy Newman is never inoffensive. That so many putative rock critics mistake Holmes's deftness for the real thing only proves how desperate we have become for original intelligence, no matter how shallow.
"
FALSE,B-,Soulful Tapestry,Honey Cone,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7027,"
Just as Sweet Replies repeated two cuts from the dud debut Take Me With You, this one repeats two from Sweet Replies--only not verbatim, which must make it all right. Wish they'd improved ""The Day I Found Myself,"" rearranged and lengthened at a slower tempo, and ""Want Ads,"" dulled with a bassier mix and stretched with orchestral break and vocal coda. I do like ""Stick-Up,"" by ""ABC"" out of ""Want Ads,"" and ""One Monkey Don't Stop No Show,"" by ""La Bamba"" out of ""Come a Little Bit Closer."" But I don't like ""Monkey"" so much I want the encore. And filler is filler, even Dozier's and Holland's.

FALSE,B-,Volume One,The Honeydrippers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4971,"
This meeting of the immortals--I refer of course to R. Plant, J. Page, and A. Ertegun, not the less than obvious r&amp;b classics they, to borrow one of the quaint titles, ""rock at midnight""--looks like the largest selling EP in history. It's not unlistenable, but I'll tell you who to buy first: Ray Charles, Roy Brown, even Phil Phillips. And Led Zeppelin--definitely Led Zeppelin.
"
FALSE,B-,Honk,Honk,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7028,"
Funky California eclecticism in the grateful tradition of Stoneground, with the difference in names indicating a gain in irony and the forced jollity of ""Gimme That Wine"" exemplifying the limitations of the style. Bonnie Koloc award for authenticity through cleanliness: Beth Fitchet, ""Oh Daddy Blues."" Jack Tempchin award for outwriting the principals: Mark Turnbull, ""Mademoiselle.""

FALSE,B-,Mars Needs Guitars!,Hoodoo Gurus,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4973,"
This is tuneful enough if you give it more of a chance than it deserves, but it's no fun because it's not funny. Without a few sly laughs they're just a macho pop band, which is less than you can say of the Fleshtones, the Nomads, presplit Squeeze, or prime Mental as Anything, to name just four.
"
FALSE,B-,Magnum Cum Louder,Hoodoo Gurus,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4974,"
One of the enduring kicks of college radio's minor-league ""underground"" is young believers and venerable adepts extracting something fresh from the same old fours. One of its nagging annoyances is headstrong faithful and professional guitarists claiming that competent variations on the truths they hold to be self-evident are brand new fun.
"
FALSE,B-,The Way It Is,Bruce Hornsby and the Range,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4977,"
Schlock has roots, too, which is why sentimental bizzers hail this mildly surprising platinum-plus debut as the second coming. Hornsby roughs up a piano that's more Elton John than Floyd Domino with a voice on the boogie side of country-rock and adds sometime folkie David Mansfield to songs that divide the same way--they sound like pop and read like something closer to the source. Title tune was my guilty pleasure of 1986 because what makes me feel guilty is succumbing to the blandishments of liberalism. The rest I don't have much trouble fighting off.
"
FALSE,B-,"Lies, Lies, Lies",Bill Horwitz,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7032,"
Like most topical singer-songwriters, Horwitz succumbs to the obvious (calling him Henry Kiss-of-Death isn't much of a punch line), the rhetorical (the word ""bosses"" in ""Father,"" which almost manages to bridge the generation gap through class feeling, suggests the Daily Worker rather than a daily worker), and the simplistic (equating the Army Corps of Engineers with the Czar's cossacks does injustice to both). But unlike most topical songwriters, Horwitz also has brushed with wisdom (the post-utopian revolutionary commitment of ""Sadness""); he sounds fresh because he is. As an anticapitalist, Horwitz figured taking his tapes to the big record companies would be a waste of time, so I can't fulminate about why this is on ESP Disk' while Richie Lecea is with RCA and Myles &amp; Lenny record for CBS. But given the courage of the record companies in these ledger-conscious times, he was probably right.
"
FALSE,B-,Yellow Fever,Hot Tuna,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7036,"
When this band went pro--and electric--my initial reaction was annoyance. I figured that at least when they were going country blues the material justified their deliberate pace. But that soon passed, and for years now I've been shelving their records without comment not out of anger or even dislike but in the simple absence of anything interesting to say. When a group maintains such a level for five years, however, its uninterestingness becomes noteworthy in itself. Think of it--kozmic blooze and negative vocals boogieing on into a countercultural time that knows no past or future, outracing the Starship on automatic pilot. Quite impressive, actually.

FALSE,B-,Dare,Human League,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4985,"
It's not flesh-and-blood chauvinism that puts me off Britannia's hookiest dance-synth monster. I'll boogie to the right machine; I can even imagine fucking a cyborg. But while the cyborg of my dreams would keep it light, not act too impressed with the tricks stored in his/her memory, League spokesman Philip Oakey comes on like three kinds of pompous jerk. The only time I light up is when Susanne Sulley takes her verse on ""Don't You Want Me,"" which I recommend to Quarterflash.

FALSE,B-,Look for the Silver Lining,Alberta Hunter,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4988,"
Since wonders of nature make bad records just like anyone else, what's amazing is that the flat writing, corny sentiment, and automatic mannerisms that bring this down barely touched the two before it. And don't be surprised if she celebrates her ninetieth by coming back yet again next time.
"
FALSE,B-,All-American Alien Boy,Ian Hunter,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7041,"
The concept fails. Hunter isn't even a one-star generalizer, and he obviously lacks that rare knack for the political song, though the bit about needing both the left wing and the right to fly is sharp (and scary). Yet the attempt at protest is gratifying, at least as honest as it is confused. At odd moments the music kicks a line like ""Justice would seem to be bored"" all the way home; ""Irene Wilde,"" a throw-in about young love, is a small treasure; and ""God (Take 1)"" is nice Ferlinghetti-style doggerel. So while I can't recommend, I kind of like.

FALSE,B-,Hi-Fi Snock Uptown,Michael Hurley,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7044,"

"
FALSE,B-,Slidewinder,J.B. Hutto & the Hawks,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7045,"
Hutto boogies easy as falling off a barstool--he's kept my body interested in a slide solo for fifteen minutes at a time. So I had hopes he'd be one artist who'd thrive in a four-songs-per-side format. But compared to 1968's six-songs-per-side Hawk Squat!--with Sunnyland Slim's keyboards and Maurice McIntyre's sax filling in the sound--this is pretty slack.
"
FALSE,B-,Between the Lines,Janis Ian,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7046,"
In this time of dearth, it's probably improvident to laugh at someone so talented--good melodies abound here, and I can't think of a rock singer who has made more unaffected and pleasurable use of her or his voice lessons. But this woman's humorlessness demands snickers. It was one thing for society's teenager to pity herself because she didn't have the integrity to stick with her black boyfriend. It's another thing for a grown-up to pity her teenaged self because she was always picked last in basketball. I mean, face it, Ms. Ian--you're short.
"
FALSE,B-,Aftertones,Janis Ian,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7047,"
Ian here establishes herself as the most technically accomplished popular vocalist of her (post-rock? post-folkie? pre-Vegas?) generation. She's even managing to curb the melodrama, as well as permitting herself unaccustomed glints of humor. But if you want to glimpse the crippling intellectual limitations of this sort of accomplishment, just get a load of her library, thoughtfully depicted on a cover that also features an open aerogram and an enigmatic mirror-as-window through which peers the artiste. There they stand, all her sources: a Modern Library Camus, The Second Sex, The Greenwich Village Bluebook, How to Survive in the Woods, and that encyclopedia of secondhand angst, Colin Wilson's The Outsider. How existential. One thing, though--mirrors are good windows only when surviving in the woods isn't something you ever have to think about.
"
FALSE,B-,Amerikkka's Most Wanted,Ice Cube,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1586,"
Musically it's as original as A Tribe Called Quest, and probably doper: with Eric Sadler thickening the mix and the vocalist bluntly banging the tracks home, it delivers the hard beats N.W.A's claque clamors about, not just for a few sucker punches but from beginning to end. Lyrically it's as piggy as it wants to be: despite his gift for rhyme and narrative, Ice Cube's politics revert to victim-of-a-racist-society belligerence except maybe on the willfully perverse (and hateful) ""The Nigga You Love To Hate."" It was inevitable that some black misogynist would elevate his problem into an emblem of outlaw status. But I say fuck the muthafucka, stay on his dick, etc.--anybody who's thinks it's cute to dub himself ""the bitch killer"" is armed, extremely dangerous, and fair game for the pickle jar.
"
FALSE,B-,One Sacred Chicken to Go,Imus in the Morning,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11432,"
Souvenir with a difference. As WNBC radio's morning man, Imus is attuned to a kind of off-the-wall ear comedy that translates well to record. As a deejay, he is genuinely outrageous--he recently announced the time an hour later than it was for an entire show--and the tapes that capture his on-the-air bravado work best here. Other bits seem designed only to prove that he can use naughty words when he's not broadcasting.

FALSE,B-,Wavelength,Insect Surfers,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5007,"
Ah, suburbia, synthesizing information overload into unheard-of pop combos native to everywhere and nowhere. Take these presumptive civil service brats, for instance. Why, they cram Commie propaganda, a Wire cover, Europop, electro-DOR, and of course surf music onto one eight-song, twenty-five-minute, $5.98-list ""EP."" But the only cut that'll be heard of again in my house is the revealingly entitled ""Fascination With the Neon.""

FALSE,B-,Have a Good Time (but Get Out Alive),Iron City Houserockers,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5009,"
Although Springsteen has his imitators--take a bow and pose for the trades, Johnny Cougar--you'd expect there'd be more. Maybe would-be up-and-comers have figured out that his sales don't match his status, or maybe integrity on that scale seems too much like work. Integrity doesn't scare Joe Grushecky, or work either, but the scale escapes him--he's less a competitor than a slightly self-conscious soul brother, shorter on talent and longer on roots. His best songs are about bars. His most revealing song is an honest if off-kilter disco-sucks anthem--called ""Blondie,"" it's about how he and Angela can't get in where they're playing her song any more, as if this is somehow her fault, and as if they're not still playing her song in places he can get in.
"
FALSE,B-,The Isleys Live,The Isley Brothers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7059,"
""Featuring Ernest Isley on Lead Guitar,"" says a sticker on the back, and that's the pitch for these (slightly) extended remakes, their last album before moving to CBS. Problem is, all that makes Little Brother a Hendrix heir is that unlike most soul-trained guitarists he doesn't merely support the vocalist--he's loud, slow, dramatic. I prefer him to Robin Trower, say--fewer chops, apter context. But they really ought to let him do his thing in the studio.

FALSE,B-,All for You,Janet Jackson,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6253,"
Fifth time through or so, having vaguely enjoyed the title tune's thirdhand chic and patted my figurative foot to two other early songs and conceived something a little more fattening when she invited/implored me (me--we hardly know each other, but hey) to ""taste"" her, I got to the Carly Simon duet again, and finally it hit me. This wasn't just weird, it was revolting. Once Janet was a repressed young thing discovering her sexuality, and that was fun for everybody; now she's a rich 35-year-old demanding sex, and even if her body wisdom is manifestly subtler than Carly's, the thrill is gone. And then there's a fabled production team that has achieved precisely nothing on its own since she turned into something slinkier and more carnivorous than a cash cow--a cash mink, say.
"
FALSE,B-,Let's Get Serious,Jermaine Jackson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5024,"
For a while, the jumpy drive and axiomatic simplicity of the Stevie Wonder-composed and -produced title track got me into the skittish banality of the others (including the two Stevie ballads). Now I recommend the single, seriously.
"
FALSE,B-,Jermaine Jackson,Jermaine Jackson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5025,"
An educational contrast for those who scorn the synthetic sheen of Thriller and Victory, this label debut by the Jackson who's a Gordy is so generic it seems cloned. Not that the fast poppers aren't fun in their mechanical way. But Jermaine's singing is devoid of idiosyncrasy. His short-lived ""new-wave"" bent surfaces as the nagging predictability of the catchy-catchy-catchy hooks/beats/riffs. And the songwriting is farmed out to such El Lay stalwarts as Michael Omartian and Andy Goldmark except on two cuts, one of them the utterly sincere, utterly bathetic ""Oh Mother."" Oh brother.
"
FALSE,B-,Night and Day,Joe Jackson,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5029,"
Every musical era generates its Paul Simon, I suppose, and though this one does avoid that literary patina, his sudden (and no doubt sincere) attraction to salsa has the same secondhand aura. Decent, intelligent sentiments decently and intelligently expressed.
"
FALSE,B-,Body and Soul,Joe Jackson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5031,"
Jackson's done it again--fabricated a creditable facsimile of somebody else's music, not jump blues this time but a brassy, Broadway pan-Gotham pastiche, sort of like West Side Story if you correct for talent differential and years elapsed. And because the new-wave Billy Joel is a role model, it's likable enough. But I prefer West Side Story, and I prefer jump-blues more.
"
FALSE,B-,Small World,Joe Jackson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5032,"
He's even more adenoidal than his worthy forebears Graham P. and Elvis C., so how come he's the one with the gold records? Must have something to do with keeping it simple, don't you think? Not that he sticks to simple subjects--the guy actually has a sense of history--but that he makes their ironies seem straightforward. And maybe he's got something--I'm not going to tell you there's any inherent truth value in bitterness or paradox. I just wish he weren't so adenoidal.
"
FALSE,B-,Music and Me,Michael Jackson,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11486,"
Having finally gotten it through my head that Michael isn't the black Donny Osmond--not only does he have a sense of natural rhythm, but he's a singer not a marionette--I listened hard and decided he's not a very good singer. Genuinely sweet and genuinely clean, when Motown provides the material. But if he's a real interpreter, I'm too old to understand where the interpretations are coming from.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Michael Jackson,Michael Jackson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7078,"
Because you can believe that their sincerity is neither feigned nor foolish, it's good in theory for children to sing romantic ballads. But in the end only pederasts, parents, and horny little girls can get off consistently on the interpretive nuances of a boy whose voice hasn't changed--the manipulation from above is simply too transparent. I love ""Rockin' Robin"" and hate ""Ben"" and find most of the rest in between. The most interesting exception is ""One Day in Your Life,"" a first-rate tearjerker that achieves just the right mix of autonomy and helpless innocence--probably because Michael cut it about a year ago, when he was sixteen.
"
FALSE,B-,Millie,Millie Jackson,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7081,"
On stage, her dress, demeanor, and delivery put across a hooker's street toughness a lot more daring than the stage toughness of Tina Turner or Laura Lee. On record, though, she remains one more funkier-than-average but basically anonymous mama. She doesn't even know what to call this album--it's Millie in the notes, (big caps) Millie (small caps) Jackson on the cover, Millie Jackson on the spine, and I Got to Try It One More Time on the label. I guess I'd prefer she try it one more time myself.
"
FALSE,B-,E.S.P.,Millie Jackson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5038,"
It stands for extra-sexual persuasion, but that's not what it means--it means he knows where her hot spots are. This is doubly inappropriate because Millie seems sick of sex. She's still convincing when she parodies sexercise or does her on-the-make impression or pleads a generic headache, but the preposterous ""Slow Tongue"" is obviously just the faked orgasm that follows the faked foreplay of the title cut. And since South Africa, she's somehow lost her feeling for the slow sermons that used to save her bleep.
"
FALSE,B-,Third Album,Jackson 5,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7069,"
The first bad sign is that the best cut on the album is a ballad. The second is that the best fast one is the tossed-off ""How Funky Is Your Chicken"" rather than a Corporation special like ""Goin' Back to Indiana"" or ""Mama's Pearl."" The third is the worst ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" I ever want to hear. Is that Jermaine or Jackie? Are we supposed to care?
"
FALSE,B-,Jade and Sarsparilla,Jade and Sarsparilla,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7089,"
If this record weren't by two women who sing love songs to each other, I'd quickly dismiss it as long on melodrama and short on melody. But the built-in societal conflict faced by two women who sing love songs to each other not only makes the melodrama more credible--conflict is the stuff of drama, right?--but is also interesting in itself, and if I were a woman who loved women I'm quite sure I'd be playing it all the time.
"
FALSE,B-,Primitive Cool,Mick Jagger,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5054,"
He grooves his overpaid pickup band, he tells Jeff Beck what to do, he writes love songs for every occasion, he doesn't even over-sing much--in short, he realizes his solo move, which beats botching it if only because the sound of a plutocrat's desperation is such an awful thing. But when I realized that ""Let's Work"" was no metaphor--that it was the plutocrat importuning his lessers to ""kill poverty"" from the bootstraps up--somehow I stopped worrying whether his ""life is trivialized."" Your choice, mister--you live with it.

FALSE,B-,Come a Little Closer,Etta James,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7094,"
Last time Gabriel Mekler went one for three as a songwriter and half-ruined his producee's album. This time he goes two for six. A ""Mekler"" tune on which Etta does nothing but moan is one of the good ones, which will give you an idea of whose contribution matters. ""St. Louis Blues"" is also a winner.
"
FALSE,B-,Get Up and Boogie,Freddie James,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7097,"
Just what you've been waiting for, I'm sure--another soprano crooning over another cleverly entitled dance track. And coming up next, oh my god, it's ""Crazy Disco Music."" Think it might help if the singer were male? Well, it does, quite a bit--very cute, very unusual. In fact, since he's already fourteen, very very unusual--his soprano days are numbered. Next step, he says, is to go to ""Hollywood,"" where they'll tell him to ""Dance Little Boy Blue."" Don't put your advance on it, kid.

"
FALSE,B-,Cold Blooded,Rick James,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5062,"
As his head continues to expand, tricks that once seemed honorably functional begin to smack of expediency, with upwardly mobile cameos throwing his shortcomings into heavy relief. Teena Marie and the latter-day Tempts he could keep up with, but on this album Smokey Robinson shows up Rick's rank sentimentality, Billy Dee Williams his cornball cool, and Grandmaster Flash his roots of clay. And the redeeming social value of ""P.I.M.P. the S.I.M.P."" trips over his fashion sense--this is not a man who should criticize his peers for dressing funny.
"
FALSE,B-,James Gang Rides Again,James Gang,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7099,"
I grant that Joe Walsh's band is more interesting than the usual power trio--because it isn't a power trio, just a trio. Walsh's guitar dominates, as is customary, but by stealth, by which I guess I mean style--rather than blasting fast he goes for country-spacey glisses that are all slide and sustain. Just wish he didn't sing that way--makes it sound like his songs are (is it possible?) guitar showcases. When's the last time my fave cut on anything was an instrumental? ""Asshtonpark,"" it's called, and it's funker than ""Funk #49.""

FALSE,B-,Nothing's Shocking,Jane's Addiction,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6074,"
The Dream Syndicate in the age of metal worship, a/k/a Alice Cooper revisited. Of course, Alice didn't get this good until album three. Then again, album three had ""I'm Eighteen"" on it, and the new guys aren't humble enough to try for one of those. Or lucky enough to get one--as Alice has spent his life proving, talent didn't have much to do with it. But if they stick at it like the pros they'll be, they might land an ""Only Women Bleed.""

On ""Pass the Peas,"" ""Gimme Some More,"" and an ensemble showpiece called ""The Grunt,"" JB is conspicuous by his conceptual presence even when he's not passing, giving, or grunting. On ""Escape-ism"" he's conspicuous by his spiritual absence even though he raps through most of the track. Elsewhere he's just missed.
"
FALSE,B-,Red Octopus,Jefferson Starship,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7110,"
This is indeed their most significant record of the decade, but what does it signify? It's their first number-one album, but it sells to an audience that refuses to distinguish between production values and musical ideas. While the returned Marty Balin is the most soulful folkie ever to set voice to plastic, he remains a mushbrain--the paragon to whom he addresses ""Miracles"" is actually compared to both a river and a stringed instrument. And to call ""I Want to See Another World"" and ""There Will Be Love"" jive-ass would be to imply that standard-brand American bullshit has style.
"
FALSE,B-,Gold,Jefferson Starship,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7114,"
Though their biographies suggest no special expertise in the subject, these aging romantics sing only about love. To put their generation in kinder perspective they encourage young Craig Chaquico to play his stupid guitar. Perennially poignant Marty Balin, now departed once again, dominates this compilation like a matinee idol squeezing another year out of his profile; perennially unpredictable Grace Slick, now also departed, sounds less and less interested in providing point or counterpoint. The music isn't utterly formulaic--from their tight folkie harmonies to their John Creach phase through various oriental mysteries they've cultivated an agreeable exoticism. But it goes nowhere except the bank.

FALSE,B-,Ton-Ton Macoute!,Johnny Jenkins,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7118,"
The former Pinetopper got upstaged by stablemate Otis Redding at his big recording opportunity many years ago, so now, in the spirit of fair's fair, the Allman Brothers Band (sans Gregg) give him another chance by backing him with some rock and roll (not ""Rock""). They sound great, too. Only problem is, Jenkins got upstaged for a reason--he doesn't have much of a voice.

FALSE,B-,WWII,Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12069,"
Last time these two ganged up, Willie kept things honest, but this is Waylon's caper: Willie sings on only half the cuts, and sounds almost as full of himself as Waylon when he does. You'd never know ""Mr. Shuck and Jive"" was about Jimmy Webb himself, and Willie's own ""Write Your Own Songs"" makes you wonder whether that ""purified country"" ""music executive"" (same guy?) got on old tougher-than-leather's nerves by asking him for a few new ones. Waylon's solo turns on ""The Last Cowboy Song"" and ""The Old Mother's Locket Trick"" are the giveaway--the idea is to acknowledge that all this outlaw myth is shuck-and-jive and then make the shuck-and-jive itself seem mythic. But despite some distinguished tunes, only their duet on ""Dock of the Bay,"" which has nothing to do with anything except its own lazy self, does the trick.

Success didn't lighten them up, but failure straightened them out--this is the hard-driving stuff preferred by all but the true gloom addicts in their target audience, with the gloom taken care of by lyrics about drugs, death, or both. It's as if they live in the glam-metal netherworld, only ever so much more tastefully--they flaunt no groupies, solos, or stupid fashion statements. If you've always had your doubts about their shtick, chances are you'll find the loss of aural mystery fatal.

Ian Anderson is one of those people who attracts admirers by means of a principled arrogance that has no relation to his actual talents or accomplishments. He does have one undeniable gift, though--he knows how to deploy riffs. Nearly every track on this album is constructed around a good one, sometimes two; play it twice and you'll have the thing memorized. But I defy you to recall any lyrics. For all his e-nun-ci-a-tion and attention to wordcraft, Anderson can't or won't create the impression that he really cares about love/friendship/privacy, which I take to be his chief theme--the verbiage isn't obscure, but he really does make it hard to concentrate. I'm sure I hear one satirical exegesis on the generation gap, though.

FALSE,B-,"The Show, the After-Party, the Hotel",Jodeci,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5917,"
No way does the sex on this concept album recall Prince or Marvin Gaye--spiritually, its precursors are Kiss and Judas Priest. Rather than lust between equals, it's powerful men manipulating starstruck girls. And since the backstage adventure with the lawsuit attached somehow goes unrecounted--supposedly, DeVante pointed a gun while K-Ci felt the complainant up, with both love men pleading guilty to less specific charges--only a fool would take their word about how knowing their honeys are. So here's hoping your mama didn't raise no fools. And here's hoping this papa didn't either.

Having concealed his egotism in metaphor as a young songpoet, he achieved success when he uncloseted the spoiled brat behind those bulging eyes. But here the brat appears only once, in the nominally metaphorical guise of ""the stranger."" The rest of Billy has more or less grown up.

Closer than any skinny-tie bands, that's for sure: gregarious, shameless, and above all profitable. Of course, if it doesn't make up in reach what it lacks in edge, ironists and aesthetes needn't notice it's there. And beyond ""Sleeping With the Television On,"" I couldn't tell you thing one about side two, which I just played three times.

Between the cardboard leatherette jacket and the cold-type rotogravure souvenir booklet is a piece of plastic with good melodies and bad Westerns on it.

For three straight albums this second-generation band, named after a Chuck Berry song by Spirit keyboard man and hard rock stalwart Jay Ferguson, has hung tough enough to attract my attention, but despite their high-speed, cross-riffing structural facility they haven't played smart enough to hold it. ""At the Spa,"" a nasty metaphor about the limits of entertainment, almost changed that. But in the end I find their oddly un-Californian rock cynicism almost as wearying as the other kinds.

As per recent habit, ""I'm a Survivor,"" ""One Hell of a Song,"" and ""Too Wild Too Long"" adduce his legend without justifying it. ""The Old Man No One Loved"" is as pointless as anything he's ever walked through, ""The U.S.A. Today"" not as bad as you'd fear. But ""The Bird"" is gloriously silly, and he hits ""I'm a Long Gone Daddy"" on the noggin. As for ""Moments of Brilliance""--well, ""Moments of Brilliance"" is the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Four of these undeniably super tracks are on Epic's essential Anniversary--Ten Years of Hits, two more on Epic's near-essential All-Time Greatest Hits: Volume 1.

For as long as ""Love Is the Drug"" and ""Private Life"" last, Jones makes you forget the Pretenders and Bryan Ferry by sheer weird force of personality, but Bill and Iggy never relinquish ""Use Me"" and ""Nightclubbing."" And then there are the ones she wrote herself.

Is she rock or disco? Disco, ripostes this farewell label sampler, right up to the Trevor Horn-ghosted autobiography ""Slave to the Rhythm."" A lot of her best material is simply ignored, and the likes of ""Love Is the Drug"" and ""My Jamaican Guy"" succumb to the concept. ""Pull Up to the Bumper,"" it turns out, is the concept.

It isn't just the skeptic in me who suspects that, despite the critical brouhaha, this young singer-songwriter's attractions are more sexual than musical or literary. It's also the male--""Stick It Into Coolsville,"" eh? But the critic knows that there are only three or four of her songs--including ""Coolsville""--that I'd enjoy hearing again.

I'm glad for her sake that she's taken the beatnik indulgences out of her life, but they're not gone from her work. A mediocre poet is one whose imagery doesn't tempt you to figure out what he or she is saying. Even when he or she is backed up by studio musicians who hang upon his or her every word. Real song: ""The Real Thing.""

FALSE,B-,Farewell Song,Janis Joplin,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5111,"
The title tune, the last she recorded with Big Brother and the best original here, is tamer than the dullest cut on Cheap Thrills, which like all her Big Brother music thrived on sheer hippie farout get-down weirdness. Four of the five other Big Brother tracks are Cheap Thrills rejects, while ""One Night Stand"" and the rap that interrupts a quite decent ""Tell Mama"" are predictable crows of sexual pragmatism. Verdict: deceased.

FALSE,B-,Cru,Seu Jorge,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13096,"
There's a reason rhythm--and not the subtle stuff: beats stated and elaborated, on percussion instruments per se or string and electronic instruments deployed percussively--looms so large for us in the music of darker-skinned foreigners who don't sing in English. Romance of the primitive not required--rhythm is where the music is, and the meaning. For non-Lusophones, this brave Brazilian favelado--who has a record out here because he's a beguiling musical presence in the minor The Life Aquatic, not because he's a commanding dramatic presence in the major City of God--is selling timbre even when he sings an Elvis trifle in the original Leiber, and timbre isn't enough. The one keeper is a Serge Gainsbourg trifle consisting of proper names and the word ""suicide."" And it too needs its rhythm track.

""What would `L'Ecriture Feminine' sound like as music?"" the once and future Kathleen Hanna asked herself, and if this is the answer we're in trouble. It sounds like Calvin Johnson prattle, it sounds like she needs all that sound equipment she can't afford, it sounds like she took her bat and went home. It's fine to reject confessional for narrative if you have some fictional craft, fine to let machines do the playing if you can figure out how to make them sing, but so far Hanna doesn't and hasn't. Instead she takes the obscure rants that were so compelling at Bikini Kill decibels and murmurs them into her cheap mike at two in the morning, if we're lucky to one of the simple tunes that provide meaning in a band context and relief in this. ""I don't expect people to like it or anything,"" she told some zine, and here's hoping they don't. She's 29, and she needs to move on.

FALSE,B-,Reality Check,Juvenile,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13270,"
Juvenile gives better interview than former N.O. labelmate Lil Wayne and appears to be a better guy, but he's also one more bore whose idea of entertainment is threatening to kill people. A few moments seem real enough--not just ""I Know You Know,"" in which he reminds his wife that, actually, he doesn't fuck all those hoes he raps about, but the street-mystique primer ""Way I Be Leanin'."" And even there Mike Jones, Paul Wall, and Wacko provide welcome relief from the nasal, constricted, humorless flow he's gotten on. Later, Fat Joe does the same. I mean, really--Fat Joe?

Between the self-affirmative signals--writing more, steady band, you know--and the ""Night in Tunisia"" cover, this is where she's supposed to come into her own, but the real clue is the leadoff ""We Can Work It Out,"" a great song she does nothing for because what she's really after is pop credibility. Although I've never thought of her as a crucial funk artist, without her usual quota of popping bass and mother-popcorn guitar her pop is soft. Nancy Wilson herself could have covered ""Night in Tunisia.""

FALSE,B-,Kiddo,Kiddo,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5136,"
Michael Hampton's band--Donnie Sterling's, really--is caught midway between P-Funk, where it's coming from, and Zapp, where it wants to go. P-Funk teaches that more is more only when you can carry that weight. Zapp teaches that when you strip down you'd better go all the way.

FALSE,B-,To Know You Is to Love You,B.B. King,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7180,"
The Stevie Wonder-composed title track isn't blues or even soul--it's one of those slow, funky grooves that smolders along for minutes before you notice you're dripping from the heat, and it almost justifies the lame idea of sending King into Sigma Sound with Dave Crawford. Elsewhere King sings indifferent songs sincerely, recites a poem he wrote, and plays his guitar when he gets the chance.
"
FALSE,B-,King Size,B.B. King,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7184,"
Old Chess man Esmond Edwards acquits himself with honor--the charts are sharp, the sidemen prime, and most of the songs good ones. But the mildness of the two Muddy Waters covers reminds us that King conceived his style as progressive from Muddy's Delta-Chicago gutbucket, and the segue from ""Mother Fuyer,"" the dirtiest traditional blues in the repertoire, to Bill Withers and Brook Benton is disorienting rather than revelatory.

FALSE,B-,Pearls: Songs of Goffin and King,Carole King,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=550,"
Forget Jerry Garcia, Robin Williamson; hell, forget Laura Nyro and Melanie. Pop's ultimate hippie isn't some sagaciously addled bohemian-for-life. It's this Brill Building alumna--she can afford it. A fireman's daughter who married her lyricist before she was one-and-twenty and divorced him before she was too old to trust herself anymore, she proved she wasn't born to follow by producing an enduring monument to you-do-your-thing-and-I'll-do-mine and then sank into the quicksand of live-and-let-live. I had hopes she'd pull out by returning to her ex-husband's lyrics, which combined commercial pith with a foretaste of the benevolent-to-cosmic truisms to come. Unfortunately hippie simplicity demands a bad faith foreign to the Shirelles, who always knew they were in show biz. While her versions of Goffin-King's late hits for the Byrds and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears come naturally enough, she can't do ""Chains"" or ""The Loco-Motion"" straight. At her best, she condescends kindly like the Bowie of Pin Ups. At her worst, she half-swings 'em, like a folkie gone jazzie, or Bobby Rydell at an oldies show.

"
FALSE,B-,Lizard,King Crimson,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7199,"
To call this progressive rock is only to prove the term an oxymoron. But if you don't insist on snappy tunes with a good beat there are quite a few textural and technical attractions here, and the cold (not cool) jazziness of their compositions does project a certain cerebral majesty--third stream that deigns (rather than fails) to swing. Unfortunately, neither Gordon Haskell nor (keep off the weeds) Jon Anderson delivers Pete Sinfield's overwrought lyrics with the sarcasm they deserve.

More appetizing than you'd expect--new lyricist Robert W. Palmer-Jones and new vocalist John Wetton add roughage to the recipe. But it's still the instrumental stuff that's worth savoring, and not only doesn't it cook, which figures, it doesn't quite jell either.

FALSE,B-,Three of a Perfect Pair,King Crimson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5143,"
Unburdened by any natural predisposition to play it again, I'm an unusually unbiased judge: side two again demonstrates Robert Fripp's rare if impractical gift for sustained instrumental composition in a rock context. Having expended many fruitless hours trying to appreciate Adrian Belew's two solo albums, I'm an unusually qualified judge: side one again demonstrates that the guy neither sings nor writes like a frontman.

FALSE,B-,Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround,The Kinks,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7205,"
Although ""Lola"" was an astounding single, the only astounding thing about this album is its relentless self-pity. The evolution of Ray Davies's singing from raunch to whine is now complete; the melodies are still there, but in this context they sound corny rather than plaintive. It's one thing to indulge your nostalgia re village greens, another to succumb to it all over a concept album about modern media. N.b.: bookkeepers, song publishers, union reps, and musimoguls aren't all like rats. Key line, from ""Got To Be Free"": ""We've got to get out of this world somehow.""
"
FALSE,B-,Preservation Act II,The Kinks,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7210,"
Many are impressed by the fact that Davies's characters (yes, folks, another dramatic work here) have taken on an extra dimension, but I say that only makes two. He's finally figured out a way to integrate the horns and the girlies--sloppy Weill and sloppy madrigal on top of the sloppy rock and roll, all very lovable--but that's not enough.
"
FALSE,B-,Sleepwalker,The Kinks,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7214,"
Ray Davies's temporary abandonment of theatrical concepts may have ruined his show, but it's freed him to write individually inspired songs again. It's also freed his band to play up to its capacity, which unfortunately falls midway between professional virtuosity and amateur fun. Doubly unfortunate, at least half the songs are in a similar range. Recommended: ""Jukebox Music"" and ""Full Moon.""
"
FALSE,B-,Low Budget,The Kinks,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3678,"
Ray Davies hasn't rocked so hard since his power-chord days in the mid-'60s, and often he shores up sloppy burlesques like the title cut just by trying harder. But I don't find his poor-mouthing crassness--the fusion of syndrum and macho-flash guitar on ""Superman"" or the schlock hooks from ""Jumping Jack Flash"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar""--at all charming, and anyone who detects irony in ""Catch Me Now I'm Falling,"" his threnody for ""Captain America,"" is too worried about the ayatollah or the Russkies to think straight. With his ceaseless whining about strikes and shortages, the plight of millionaires and the cruelty of prostitutes, Davies has turned into the voice of the middle-class ressentiment he's always been a sucker for. No, Ray, you don't have to be a superman just to ""survive."" Especially if you've got a song catalogue.

FALSE,B-,Come Dancing With the Kinks/The Best of the Kinks 1977-1986,The Kinks,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5148,"
I didn't attend the seven-album output reduced here to two discs with the care due a legendary songwriter--the ""survivor"" in him swallowed the songwriter years ago. His anomalously autumnal U.S. ascendancy was a disaster--attitudes forgivably eccentric in one of the great dotty Englishmen turned ugly and mean, and tunecraft so delicate it threatened to waft away on the next zephyr assumed an unbecoming swagger. The title tune was his biggest hit since 1964 because it's a perfect pop sentiment. Second-best is by Dave Davies, not Ray: ""There's no England now,"" he opines, which explains a lot.
"
FALSE,B-,Alive,Kiss,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7217,"
There are those who regard this concert double as a de facto best-of that rescues such unacknowledged hard rock classics as ""Deuce"" and ""Strutter"" from the sludge. There are also those who regard it as the sludge. I fall into neither category--regret the drum solo, applaud ""Rock and Roll All Nite,"" and absorb the thunderousness of it all with bemused curiosity. The multimillion kids who are buying it don't fall into either category either.

FALSE,B-,Rock and Roll Over,Kiss,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7219,"
Those who dismiss them as unlistenable are still evading the issue: they write tough, catchy songs, and if they had a sly, Jagger-style singer they'd be a menace. But they aren't a menace, my wife and my sister assure me; the kids get off on the burlesque. Does this mean that when the cartoon hero in the platform shoes bellows an order to grab the rocket in his pocket all the twelve-year-olds are aware that this is a caricature of sex, and macho sex at that? Really, I'd like to know. But I'm not getting down on my knees to find out.

FALSE,B-,Get the Knack,The Knack,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7220,"
Cognoscenti I know tend to couch their belief that this is the Anticlash in purely technical terms--harmonies treacly, production punched up, and so forth. Bullshit. I too find them unattractive; if they felt this way about girls when they were unknowns, I shudder to think how they're reacting to groupies. But if they're less engaging musically than, say, the Scruffs, they have a lot more pop and power going for them than, say, the Real Kids. In other words, ""My Sharona"" is pretty good radio fare and let's hope ""She's So Selfish"" isn't the next single. Face it, this is a nasty time, and if the Stranglers are (or were, I hope) Sgt. Barry Sadler, these guys are only Freddie and the Dreamers. Docked a notch for clothes sense.

FALSE,B-,Knight Time,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7223,"
Or does she transcend her material after all? This is a typical Motown exploitation, comprising two strong songs that should have been on Neither One of Us plus manufacturer's seconds. Yet her moral seriousness loses none of its weight, and there's something in her voice, a hurtful rough place the honey missed, that makes me want to listen through the humdrum dynamics of the tracks.
"
FALSE,B-,Life,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5154,"
The reflectiveness of her interpretations has never extended to her choice of material--the honest journeywoman in her must prefer contract songwriting. So she does what she's always done over ""contemporary"" settings that don't clash or mesh or otherwise call attention to themselves. Amid the various shades of schlock and dancy compromise, the best songs are those she wrote with her coproducers, Sam Dees and Bubba Knight, and the only notable one is ""Strivin',"" the most straight-up bourgie boogie since ""Bon Bon Vie."" Even at its most committed, professionalism can get pretty boring.

N.O. bros whose house burned down after Katrina. Backstory, check. ""Hipster rap"" that knows Fishbone and the Cars exist(ed). Concept, check. And then? They're not very hooky, they're not very funny, they play guitar but not very well. Their rhymes convey no passion for language or human experience. All that separates them from the afterparty vacuity of corporate/Los Angeles hip-hop is their eclecticism and their taste in clothes. This is a new direction? It's not even a halfway decent collection of songs.

FALSE,B-,Bonnie Koloc,Bonnie Koloc,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7231,"
After a bland follow-up complete with standard singer-songwriter covers, this fulfills perhaps half the promise of her more attractive pretensions. Her songs drift off into their own imagery, and I've caught her rhyming ""warm"" and ""morn,"" but she has more to say about her father than Judy Collins and more to say about snakes than Alice Cooper. Her melodies are durable. And the cleanliness of her voice is saved from antisepsis by a cornfed openness that has Waterloo, Iowa, written all over it.
"
FALSE,B-,At Her Best,Bonnie Koloc,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7232,"
Her most consistent album to date is marred by chummy material (who is David Van Delinder and why did she release his ""Roslyn"" once much less twice?), half-assed commerciality (two is one too many Jim Croce songs), and dumb experiments (arting up Jackson Browne is carrying grass to Topanga). Fortunately, it's also marked by a goodly selection of her more consistent originals--the eighty-percenters is how I think of them--as well as the definitive version of ""You're Gonna Love Yourself in the Morning"" (not to mention Jim Croce's ""Hard Way to Go""). But the real reason I continue to listen through the bad tries is that she sings the way Lily Tomlin has always wished she could.

I still like Koloc's individualism--anybody who can sing Willie Dixon's ""I Need More"" like a B-movie schoolmarm who's sexy when she takes off her glasses is jake with me. But despite her ear for songs and her willingness to experiment (a wino provides running commentary on side two) she still gets boring. Maybe she should try contact lenses.

Funk pioneers in the early '70s, crossover pioneers in the early '80s, and don't blame yourself if this impressive double play missed you coming and going--anonymity is their signature. When I undertook a professional reexamination of their latest piece of platinum, I was surprised to recognize all three hits on side one from the radio. Quite liked ""Misled,"" sort of liked ""Fresh,"" rather disliked ""Cherish""--and had never wondered who did any of them.

The Iron Butterfly of ������������������berrock--Mike Oldfield for unmitigated simpletons, sort of, and yet in my mitigated way I don't entirely disapprove. A melody or two worth hearing twice emanates from a machine determined to rule all music with a steel hand""In-a-Gadda-da-Vida"" sans drum solo, with a lyric (trot provided) that could become the ""What's Life?

The least embarrassing LP either had made in years is a testament of what just might be a fairly interesting marriage. The way you can tell is that the love songs about separation and temptation and compulsion and good-timing work out, while the ode to romantic serenity (could it be by the same Sherman brothers who occasionally soundtrack a Disney movie?) sound like it was recorded at gunpoint.

FALSE,B-,The Winning Hand,"Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Brenda Lee",1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5166,"
This twenty-song mix-and-match isn't even monumental in theory, because two of these ""kings and queens of country music"" haven't earned their crowns--BL is a rock and roll princess who never really graduated, KK a frog ditto. But BL is also a pleasing bedroom-voiced journeywoman who turns in half of a surprisingly definitive ""You're Gonna Love Yourself in the Morning."" The other half comes from WN, who's on nine cuts and sounds like he's thinking even when he also sounds like he's asleep. DP teams with WN on a surprisingly definitive ""Everything's Beautiful in Its Own Way,"" but sounds more at home on the album's two utter unlistenables--""Ping Pong,"" in which DP at her cutesiest is outdone by KK at his klutziest, and ""Put It Off Until Tomorrow,"" in which DP kisses KK's warty little head and he croaks back.

There are obviously significant political differences between Fela and the musician he most resembles, James Brown--JB has never been imprisoned for his egomania, which is the least inflammatory construction that can be put on why Fela is in jail at this moment. More likely it's the ingrained defiance of the Nigerian government voiced (though my pidgin isn't so advanced that I get all the details) by the three songs he squeezes onto this live double. That's right, three songs--like JB, Fela is a true son of vamp-till-ready. Unfortunately, since he's not a world-class saxophonist or singer, and since his touring unit is long on brass and short on things to hit (one conga total), eighty minutes of steady but not quite uplifting groove punctuated by interesting horn arrangements is what you get.

I approve of any revitalization of the American-democratic myth, but life in the Lyman Family must not be very good-timey.

For me, this is a first--a calypso artist who sings about subjects I know something about in an accent I managed to understand. Granted, I can't really judge how he stacks up against competition--no more than adequately would be my guess--but I suspect that if ""Alien"" were on the same side as ""Identity"" and (yes) ""Meshuggener"" I'd get more than a mild kick when this showed up at the end of the stack.

In which Lanois adapts the all-embracing New Orleans groove to new age--not soft or lite or adult contemporary--rock. It has that intellectual aura, you know? Contemplating the human condition in sound as well as folkish words and melody, the mild-voiced Eno crony pieces together compositions that are half song, half ""atmosphere"" (as in ""The atmosphere for this goes back a few years""). And tops them off with just you guess--""Amazing Grace,"" dummy.

Like Barry White, Lattimore is the strong talkative type--never jabbering, never letting up on the line. Unlike Barry White, he sings with enough variety to keep the backing to five basic pieces. Like Barry White, he tends to repeat himself.
"
FALSE,B-,True Colors,Cyndi Lauper,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5352,"
Cheap sentiment plus star-budget video make the first side so disheartening that the second isn't much more than a relief. Just as the sensitive relationship songs retreat from the perils of triads and the pleasures of jerking off, ""What's Going On"" is a nostalgic generalization after the first album's confrontation with capital. Girls just want to have money--and no fun changes everything.

FALSE,B-,In Flight,Alvin Lee,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11513,"
Considering that this live double-LP might well have consisted of eight or nine speed-rapt blues solars and a couple of shorties, it is a triumph of discipline, and Lee's countryish r&amp;b renderings do no dishonor to the memory of Elvis Presley. But his own compositions lack bite, and the covers are never more interesting that the originals. Elvis's most always were.

FALSE,B-,Vindicator,Arthur Lee,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7261,"
As the brains behind Love, the Los Angeles equivalent of the Velvet Underground in both critical and commercial clout, Lee majored in popsong and minored in instrumental excursions of unusual long-windedness. On this record his brush with Jimi at the time of False Start seems to have fused these two interests. At its worst--which is nowhere near as bad as the second side of Da Capo--Lee elaborates Jimi's vocal style while Charles Karp strives fruitlessly to keep up on guitar. At its best--which is nowhere near as amazing as the first side of False Start--he offers readymade blues-based popsongs of undeniable drive and charm. What tips the balance for me is the only phrase that stays in my mind: ""Ooh what a dish, she smelled just like a fish."" Jimi was too sweet ever to make his sexism that nasty.

FALSE,B-,I Can't Make It Alone,Laura Lee,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7266,"
Lee shows a lot of singing skills here--without downplaying her natural rasp she achieves a gratifying fullness (even softness), and she knows how to put her range at the service of a song's drama. Now if only these songs had some drama--the best moment is a whispered ad lib in which Lee describes a seduction play-by-play. And the title concept is a disgrace--180 degrees is too damn far to turn even if that is the way life comes out sometimes.

You look at Kat Arthur's mascara and chains and listen to the band's simple hard rock and wonder whether they're HM or punk. If Arthur were a guy, this would bode ill, but a guy she definitely ain't, so she still has Joan Jett to look up to. And like Joan Jett she's got more instinct than brains, which is why her third indie album isn't quite what her cult and well-wishers have been long awaiting.
"
FALSE,B-,Life Sentence to Love,Legal Weapon,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5361,"
Kat Arthur makes her belated major-label debut too damn late, carrying the eternal Joan Jett comparison far into love-is-pain clich������������������. The tunes are even further from Jett's best than Jett's latest, with the dark undertow that once colored Brian Hansen's music succumbing to upbeat hooks that rise out of the locomotion like blueb"
FALSE,B-,Walls and Bridges,John Lennon,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7269,"
These songs seem more felt than those on Mind Games, probably because they express personal pain rather than generalized optimism--""Bless You,"" to Yoko in someone else's arms, is a real leap. But the melodies are received, the accompaniment ordinary, and the singing disoriented. What can it be like for this ex-Beatle to trade harmonies with Elton John (who sings backup on ""Surprise, Surprise,"" just as Lennon does on Elton's new single) in the inescapable knowledge that it's Elton who's doing him the favor?
"
FALSE,B-,Rock 'n Roll,John Lennon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1792,"
No doubt mysteries of emotional and rhythmic commitment (soul and groove) determine why this runs out of gas after ""Be-Bop-a-Lula"" and ""Stand by Me."" But it's also true that covering Gene Vincent and Ben E. King is considerably less perilous than covering Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Fats Domino, whose songs follow. Which may be why ""Ya Ya"" (Lee Dorsey) and ""Just Because"" (Lloyd Price) work. Too bad he didn't go for more esoterica--this could have been another Moondog Matinee.
"
FALSE,B-,Kamikaze,Deke Leonard,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7272,"
Man's main man has optimistic ideas about kamikaze--on the cover he's wearing a parachute in a tree. Almost like recording solo albums while you're in a group--nice to have a cushion.
"
FALSE,B-,Picture This,Huey Lewis and the News,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5371,"
The onetime Marin country-rocker and Elvis C. backer-upper is now working a working-guy variation on Rindy Ross (Quarterflash, dummy), cutting his macho strut with pop moues and knowing nods at women's lib. Though he has none of Springsteen's feeling for narrative and sings from the diaphragm rather than the gut, he's canny enough to pick good covers and writes his share of reasonable facsimiles: ""Workin for a Livin"" could be primo Bob Seger and ""The Only One"" is worthy of Geldof or Lynott if not the master. But Chris Hayes's metal furbelows soon remind you how much Huey sounds like Louie (Gramm) (Foreigner, dummy). I mean, Dewey really need one more rock pro bulling his way through options that just aren't as limited as he makes his living pretending?
"
FALSE,B-,Fore!,Huey Lewis and the News,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5373,"
Last time he said bad is bad, this time he says hip is square, and there you have the difference between a straight-shooting album and a conventional one, between one that catches your elbow and one they ram down your throat.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Jerry Lee Lewis Volume II,Jerry Lee Lewis,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7277,"
Decadence, decadence. Even at his so-called best he parodies himself, and his delight in his own insincerity seems narrow, joyless. Jerry Kennedy, formerly a model of restraint, throws on choruses, strings, horns, flutes. The nadir is the lachrymose ""Middle Age Crazy,"" about a forty-year-old ""trying to prove that he still can."" Forty-year-old Jerry Lee takes that one at about half the tempo of his manic ""Sweet Georgia Brown,"" which together with ""Chantilly Lace"" proves that he still can.
"
FALSE,B-,When Two Worlds Collide,Jerry Lee Lewis,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5376,"
The title weeper's a cut above the rest, but new producer Eddie Kilroy doesn't push Jerry Lee the way Bones Howe did on Jerry Lee Lewis. In fact, all that rescues this record from boredom and arrogant excess are two ancient throwaways--""Alabama Jubilee"" (1915) and ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie Goodbye"" (1922)--plus an obscure BMI copyright called ""I Only Want a Buddy Not a Sweetheart"" that also evokes prerock tradition. His voice is on its way out and he's lucky if his spirit shows up on alternate Thursdays, but if he wants to tell us he's a classic I'll nod my head. And pat my foot.
"
FALSE,B-,Lark,Linda Lewis,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7280,"
This convent-educated West Indian Londoner has a cute voice, all blithe and flighty, but she also wrote all twelve of these songs and produced herself at age twenty-two--beneath the little girl who likes the flowers in your toes there's a hard-headed woman who wouldn't care if your moon was in the dustbin. How hard you're willing to look for the woman--and thus enjoy the girl's deft, sprightly, folkish music--depends on your tolerance for or attraction to cute facades. Mine decreases every time I listen.

If Gordon had dyed his hair and taken a short course at the local car wash--you think he would have lasted a week?--he might have found a new career as Jim Croce II. Instead, he scored one of his periodic hit singles, thus securing his status as a weird new kind of purist: uncompromising proponent of commercial folk music. Two songs about the lure of the sea and one about urban despair go down as easy as the usual plaints about female perfidy. Chad lives?

FALSE,B-,The Last Record Album,Little Feat,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2080,"
It's no surprise that as they run out of things to say--all this adds to our insight into interpersonals is a few turns of phrase--they figure out artier ways of saying them. In fact, it's a bore. I'd recommend ""Long Distance Love"" to Wilson Pickett, though.
"
FALSE,B-,Men Without Women,Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5384,"
The lyric sheet makes good reading--the confessions of a working-class teenager who got what he wanted and lost what he had (though he would have lost it anyway by now, and had less money besides). Unfortunately, Little Miami Steve sounds like arena-period Dylan doing the Born to Run songbook, and the E-Streeters in his band blare like Silver Bullets. If the Boss really is driving around El Lay wondering what happened, as one rumor has it, he could do worse than rescue ""Men Without Women"" and ""Princess of Little Italy."" Only don't pronounce it ""Lily,"" okay, Bruce?

FALSE,B-,Cry Tough,Nils Lofgren,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7294,"
This one makes me feel shitty. Epic could never break his best stuff and has now topped off the disservice by discontinuing his albums. Meanwhile, over at A&amp;M, Nils begins to sound like a professional next-big-thing, the surprise of his lyrics reduced to a turn or two and his gift for pop melody subsumed by his gift for the one-man rave-up. Crying tough is playing tough, not being tough, and there was always more than toughness to Nils anyway.

FALSE,B-,Pontiac,Lyle Lovett,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2183,"
He's another Nashville neotraditionalist who's trying his damnedest to surpass a not-bad debut, a rounder who's better off playing the husband (as in the unembittered ""Give Back My Heart"" and ""She's No Lady""), with something of Merle's jazz feel and a weakness for songpoetry (""If I Had a Boat,"" help). And he's something of a hit as he joins such succes d'estime as pure Ricky Skaggs, clean Dwight Yoakam, clear-eyed Ricky Van Shelton, straight George Strait, reborn Reba McEntire, King Shit Randy Travis, and the great Rosanne Cash in a critical-commercial conflux that recalls the chart-topping days of Beatles, Stones, and, er, Jefferson Airplane. Why isn't this more of an up? Because all it means is that the folkies have taken over the establishment again, and a piss-poor one at that--these artists often spend the better part of a year going gold. Granted, the new trend does lend credence to the old folkie claim of proximity to the hearts of the people. But it also lends credence to the old antifolkie charge of middle-class romanticism in disguise.

In the absence of a lucky hook or three, this universal expatriate is better off unhinged and pretentious (side two) than headed straight down the pop pipe (side one). Of course, in the absence of a lucky hook or three, so's Neil Diamond. Just wish I was sure the song about Joan of Arc was tongue-in-cheek.

One thing you can figure about a funk band that gets me jiggling up and down to a song called ""It's Time to Be Real"": They must be real funky. Another thing you can figure is that their slow ones are unlikely to bring a tear to the eye or a chuckle to the lips.

FALSE,B-,Word of Mouf,Ludacris,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11203,"
It was ludicrous for an employee of the Fox Network, especially a lying bully like Bill O'Reilly, to criticize anyone else for coarsening public discourse. It was amusing to watch the Britney pimps at Pepsi cave first to O'Reilly and then to Ludacris, who with the help of the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network held Pepsi up for a few million to ""support the arts in communities at risk,"" a matter in which I eagerly await the Ludacris Foundation's audited progress report. Also, he raps and rhymes with gusto, and I like his Timbaland beat so much I don't want to know how real its Glocks are. Nevertheless, he is or impersonates a no-class pimp motherfucker, and if he never reached a one of the nine-year-olds O'Reilly yammers about, he would still be coarsening public discourse. Song after song pumps the pimp theory that all women are whores. Rotate good-humored dance songs in which the best thing you say about female persons is that they crave your tallywhacker and the worst is that you'll murder them if they bother, and you'll change how real human beings of both sexes think and behave. Anyone who claims different is certainly a liar and probably a bully.

FALSE,B-,Natural Ingredients,Luscious Jackson,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5909,"
These four estimable women exemplify the limitations of scene loyalty and good intentions. Only a killjoy would piss on their project--a friendly alternative funk that stands as a confident reproof to the usual sexual and racial caricatures. I like them fine as people, and I wouldn't even say I don't like their music. It's just that I don't, well, like their music. The ear food it provides is so scant that all you want to know about ""Energy Sucker""'s hook riff is where they found the sample, and I find it hard to believe they pack an irresistible aural buzz even for those who experience their project as a cause.
"
FALSE,B-,Machine,Machine,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7314,"
""There but for the Grace of God Go I,"" with lyric entirely by August Darnell, is irresistible musically--still the disco disc of the year. The two tracks with lyrics partly by August Darnell are mildly arresting musically. And the other four are ordinary Isleys-influenced black pop/funk/rock.
"
FALSE,B-,Absolutely,Madness,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5399,"
Just like the Specials and the Selecter, they have second album problems, with the cockneys soft-pedaling the same subject that confounds the two-toners: ""Embarrassment,"" which saxophonist Lee Thompson says was inspired by his sister's mixed-race pregnancy, sounds like it's about an arrest, or the wrong haircut. And though close attention reveals the same class contretemps and irrational fears that haunt Jerry Dammers, no American will suss these songs unaided. This may be localism and it may be songcraft, but it's probably both.
"
FALSE,B-,Raw Magic,Magic Slim and the Teardrops,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5401,"
It ain't magic because it ain't raw enough--Slim conscientiously approximates the licks and grooves of his betters without adding a thing. In contrast, his Rooster EP is a lot cruder and considerably more exciting. Which is not to suggest he could keep it up for forty minutes anywhere but a South Side bar.
"
FALSE,B-,Satisfied 'n Tickled Too,Taj Mahal,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7322,"
Better the Intergalactic Soul Messengers Band, who improvise less and back more (though unfortunately they compose more too), than the East-West Connection Orchestra, who root Taj in Philadelphia on ""Baby Love"" (no, not that ""Baby Love""). And better John Hurt's title tune and Taj's ""Ain't Nobody's Business"" than either.
"
FALSE,B-,Inner Worlds,Mahavishnu Orchestra/John McLaughlin,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7330,"
McLaughlin's return to a small group would seem overdue, but in fact he's right on time--trapped in the dead end he saw looming ahead of him way back in 1973, which is why he resorted to orchestrations in the first place. Yup, John's got himself a funk fusion group just like Jan Hammer and Billy Cobham. Stu Goldberg (come back, Jan) and Ralphe Armstrong (composer of ""Planetary Citizen"") are the sidemen, Narada Michael Walden the coauthor. Walden has better technical control of funk rhythms than a lot of jazz-oriented players, but he's squeamish about grease, and as a result his tunes tend to be cute even when they're good. McLaughlin, meanwhile, tends to be impressive even when he's repeating himself. But not that impressive.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Louise Mandrell & R.C. Bannon,Louise Mandrell & R.C. Bannon,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5406,"
In ""From 18 to 33,"" they spend fifteen years not getting divorced and live to enjoy it. The rest of their conjugal hogwash is distinguished primarily by two timeless puns--""Just Married"" (from bumper sticker to state of being) and ""Our Wedding Band"" (barroom buddies)--and, can it be, a syndrum.
"
FALSE,B-,The Good Earth,Manfred Mann's Earth Band,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7349,"
Manfred has learned just enough about the synthesizer to be dangerous, as his previous album proved, but at least this one, intended to be ""more accessible,"" improves with listening. Two songs are homely enough to justify the name of this progressive-identified intragalactic conspiracy: ""I'll Be There"" and ""Be Not Too Hard.""

FALSE,B-,Music Madness,Mantronix,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2237,"
The first rap act since Flash to be named after its DJ will make a believer out of you maybe half the time--Mantronik's beats have that much groove, variety, and (damn right) human touch. ""Listen to the Bass of Get Stupid Fresh Part II,"" which features a harmonica, is a minimalist tour de force. M.C. Tee, poor soul, needs boasting lessons.

FALSE,B-,Kids in Philly,Marah,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5830,"
Though the press kit just barely mentions Springsteen, anyone intrigued by their reviews should be aware that these young adults from Philly flatter Bruce sincerely enough to make a grown man wince. Just as banjos and mandolins overshadow synths and samples along their E Street revisited, so old-fashioned urban-sentimentalist local color like ""Reet Petite,"" Rocky Balboa, and watches that need winding warm their hearts, while indications that they still keep their eyes open--modern stuff like hazmats, Members Only menswear, ghettos ""teeming with beats that reverberate fear""--chill their very souls. They deserve a Big Man of their own.

This woman suffers from Don Rickles's syndrome--when she gets serious, watch out for flying horseshit. But ""The Colorado of Your Mind"" (""Go shove it up, the toochas of your mind!"") and ""Drop Dead"" are nasty and hilarious, the kind of songs that are adjudged ""offensive to our listeners"" by sensitive (male) program directors. Martin Mull should have a tenth of her spirit.

Here's another one of those live doubles I'd love to love--because I still think they're a great band when it's customary to put them down, and because the night I caught was magnificent. But I prefer the studio versions of every one of these songs (including ""Punky Reggae Party,"" available as an import single). In other words, here's another one of those live doubles.

The subhook on ""Echo Beach,"" the club hit that brought this Canadian skinny-tie music to our attention, is perfect: ""My job is very boring I'm an office clerk."" The worst bore in the world wouldn't say ""office"" in that sentence; it's there to scan. Yet there's something endearingly gawky in the obviousness of the device. See also this confessional: ""I wish that I could be decisive/Then I'd understand where life is going for me.""

Nick Lowe graduated from Brinsley Schwarz; Moon graduated from Southwind. As an authentic Texahoma native, he does up his hooks neorockabilly style, affecting a country-punk toughness that comes complete with the formal distance that's caught on in France and other distant places. He is to Nick Lowe as Southwind was to Brinsley Schwarz. There is no substance to reports that he'll join Jules Shear in a cult supergroup called Pop Pile.

FALSE,B-,Mystery Ticket,Moon Martin,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5419,"
Martin seems intent on fulfilling his formal promise: the hooks keep getting bigger and the beat keeps getting edgier. In fact, for a thirtyish wimp who frequently threatens to murder his girlfriend, he's quite an attractive fellow.

Mas is one of those folksingers who likes ""good"" rock and roll so much that she feels honored to contribute kitsch poetry like ""Snow"" and kitsch pop like ""Do You Believe I Love You"" to the genre. So I was surprised to find myself enjoying four of these songs and getting off on two, ""Sadie Says"" and ""Quote Goodbye Quote."" Only you know what? Her guitarist, David Landau, turns out to have cocomposing credits on three songs here, and they just happen to be my three favorites. Wonder how he sings.

FALSE,B-,Tomorrow,Hugh Masekela With Kalahari,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5420,"
The words document his losses, his struggle, his oppression as a South African exile. I learned from them, and that's high praise for any lyric. The music documents the life he wants to lead, which is as corny as any other dance-fusion jazz played by musicians overimpressed with their own chops. He has a right to that life, obviously. Just as obviously, I have a right to pursue my own life elsewhere.

FALSE,B-,Very Best of Dave Mason,Dave Mason,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7364,"
ABC has finally compiled a Dave Mason album as good as Alone Together by the simple expedient of omitting only the worst and longest of Alone Together's eight songs (two of which have now appeared on five of Mason's six ABC/Blue Thumb albums), adding the two live Traffic-originated tracks, and sticking on one from Headkeeper. Engaging throughout, especially compared to his Columbia stuff, and true to Mason's place in history. With his gentle, multipercussive impetus, warm but basically characterless vocals, skillful hooks, and dippy lyrics, the man is the father of California rock-pop. Loggins &amp; Messina, the Doobie Brothers, Pabo Cruise, every folkie who ever tried to swing a little, where would any of them be without Dave? Docked for wellspringing.

FALSE,B-,Tigers Will Survive,Ian Matthews,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11478,"
I know that Matthews (Fairport Convention, Matthews Southern Comfort) is one of the best acoustic-type performers around. I enjoy him at clubs. But they tell me that all the tunes on the record catch up to you, and after listening a dozen times I'm up to two--""Da Doo Ron Ron,"" which had a head start, and ""The Only Dancer.""
"
FALSE,B-,Later That Same Year,Matthews' Southern Comfort,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7367,"
This one really is pretty--except when guitarist Carl Barnwell gives him love letters to read (long-winded, too: ""Sylvie"" runs 6:08 and ""For Melanie"" 6:50), he selects very lissome melodies. And no dumb lyrics, either. But when you're so single-minded about singing pretty it's hard to convince anyone you care what the words mean.

Last time he announced his lack of ""concern or interest in astrology,"" so when the zodiac showed up as a packaging motif I began to get nostalgic for the Impressions. But though the vagueness that was Curtis's chief flaw runs rampant musically (""Love to Keep You in My Mind"" goes nowhere slowly) and lyrically (""Underground"" is one long mixed metaphor), it's not all that bad--the relaxed, natural groove of Mayfield's falsetto and his rhythm section are both seductive. Only on the lead cuts, however--especially the heavy-breathing sex opus ""Get Down""--does he sweep you off your feet.

FALSE,B-,Mac McAnnally,Mac McAnally,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7377,"
Although it does often sound pat, as folk stoicism will in a post-folk context, the first side comes across pretty outspoken for a Mississippi singer-songwriter with royalties in the bank--the heroine of one song is a rape victim who murders both assailant and judge after the latter lets off the former. Side two is Joe South.

I've finally figured out what people mean when they call Paulie pop--they mean he's not rock. But to me pop implies a strict sense of received form whether crafted by the dB's or Billy Joel. McCartney's in his own world entirely, which is the charm of his music. And of course, a reliance on charm has always been his weakness. This is quite pleasant except when Britain's number-one earner preaches against violence as if self-interest wasn't an issue, which is also the only time it comes into firm contact with the great outside.

I could warn ya that Linda and Nicolette's prior claim on all early-'60s revivals is established conclusively on the lacklustre arrangements on ""Cupid"" and ""Save the Last Dance for Me."" But would Linda or Nicolette risk putting five of their own songs on a major-label debut? They don't even have five of their own songs.
"
FALSE,B-,A Life and Time,Mary McCaslin,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5431,"
When I fail for a fourth time to listen to a title song all the way through, I stop blaming myself and start blaming the singer-songwriter. Whose best original here, a passionately reserved exploration of the limits of gotta-move-on-babe, was written in 1969, and whose best cover, a passionately tender lesson in the limits of I-can't-trust-babe, copies an arrangement by the Dirt Band. Side-openers both, which is why I bothered with the title song.

FALSE,B-,Love Rustler,Delbert McClinton,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11762,"
McClinton's cult sentimentalizes bar music. The fact that bars encourage a relatively innocent functionality--pleasing a small concrete audience rather than a [ . . . ] make them any more ""authentic"" than studios: McClinton is essentially a male Texas version of Linda Ronstadt--a strong-voiced, versatile singer who doesn't seem like an especially interesting person. This means not only that he's at the mercy of songwriters and arrangements but also that he isn't likely to have very distinctive taste in either. The title cut is a classic, and several of the remakes are worth hearing more than twice, but asa whole this album is as pleasant and forgettable as a Friday night out.

He's an innovator, he's a virtuoso, he even has a sense of humor, but he's also a mite precious, not to say arty, and this unaccompanied scat demonstration encourages his formalistic proclivities. As with so many solo recitals, technical display is emphasized; fact is I've heard numerous saxophonists do more with ""Donna Lee"" and numerous drummers do more with ""I Feel Good."" One reason the voice is such a sublime instrument is that it can pronounce words, and give or take a catchphrase or two the only ones he bothers with here are his own lyrics for ""I'm My Own Walkman."" Wonder when some creative type is finally going to stick up for those of us who'd rather consume music than manufacture it.
"
FALSE,B-,Simple Pleasures,Bobby McFerrin,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5437,"
No matter how much aid and comfort it gives the enemy, there's no point denying ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" unless you're tin-eared enough to think it doesn't capture a feeling or deluded enough to think poor people never share it. Title tune's the real Republican lie--McFerrin's celebration of 6 a.m. wakeup neglects to mention that his morning is unencumbered by a j-o-b--and even that's probably a tragic consequence of some fundamental mindlessness. Passing as an Artist on skill and fluidity alone, he's a vocal Keith Jarrett come down with the cutes--or maybe a musical Marcel Marceau.
"
FALSE,B-,Cardiff Rose,Roger McGuinn,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7400,"
I'd written him off before Rolling Thunder, too, but this record, produced by fellow Roller Ronson and featuring various tour buddies, rocks wilder than anything he ever did with the Byrds. Unfortunately, it's more confusing than astonishing. The factitious folk songs about piracy and the Holy Grail make fewer contemporary connections than the real folk song ""Pretty Polly."" Ditto the previously unrecorded donations from fellow Rollers Mitchell and Dylan. Imagining how Dylan might sing ""Up to Me,"" which sounds like a forerunner of ""Simple Twist of Fate,"" you begin to miss the quavery McGuinn or yore. And the song that's actually about Rolling Thunder is pretty sickening.

After taking in Girls Against Boys' searing analysis of the culture-killing boypop scam in The Nation, which certainly needed the heads-up, I sought a class enemy to hit on, but the best I could do was this mildly annoying Old Kid. Featureless funk holds up an album that rode to gold on the back of the overstated title ballad. It's not even tripe--more in the line of twaddle, only less pretentious. Right, he should act his age like his ex-bandmate Jordan, and deserves the obscurity to which he will soon return. But in a world that contains George W.

Supporters apologize for calling this stuff ""eclectic"" not because the clich������������������ embarrasses them, but because they know the band's much-bruited groove will sound suspiciously like a hodgepodge to heathens like me. Bad Brubeck, Jimmy Smith as fusion, musique concr������������������te ordinaire, soundtracks for arty shorts about urban hyperactivity--it's all these things and more, one after "

Dave Mustaine is earnest about his rage--at nuclear holocaust and the P.M.R.C. and lying scumbags and his own self-destructive tendencies. He covers the Sex Pistols like a champ. He doesn't boast, he doesn't preen, he allows himself but a single ""bitch"" on an entire long-playing record (she sounds very irresponsible and probably deserves it). And thus the latest well-regarded metal band gains its modest portions of profit and respect. But where's the monster guitar? Where's the angel singing like a bat out of hell? Where's the big deal? Upped a notch for meaning well.

FALSE,B-,The Mekons Story,The Mekons,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5450,"
Over sixty minutes of previously unreleased tunes or worktapes have been crammed onto twelve inches of vinyl by this since disbanded band or collective, so play it loud or it'll sound like a tree falling in the forest with no one there to hear. Which is actually the idea. As rock ������������������pater les bourgeois goes, it's humane, imaginative--none of the malignant contempt of Metal Machine Music or Flowers of Romance. A few of the tracks forge form from the refusal of techni""Letter's in the Post"" and Mark White's mad-busker voice-and-footstomp revery ""The Building"" more convincing candidates than any of the rough postpunk or folk-rock or Anglodisco numbers. But unless you're heavily into the byways of anarchist negation, most of it demands more consideration than there's any reason to expect from the ordinary harassed citizen, social worker, journalist, or record executive.

FALSE,B-,Four Sides of Melanie,Melanie,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7413,"
Two of which you can skip: the formless formative stuff (she's eternally callow so who needs it, though ""I Really Loved Harold"" and ""Somebody Loves Me"" are nice) and the unspeakable contemporary covers (Dylan, Taylor, and Jagger as Blake, Keats, and Coleridge). But even without ""Brand New Key"" her hits have their charms--""What Have They Done to My Song Ma"" and ""Nickel Song"" on one theme and ""Lay Down"" and ""Peace Will Come"" on the other. And except for the labored ""Psychotherapy"" the weird stuff is quite amusing. She ought to ask herself, though, why the two best cuts on her best-of are the aforementioned tune, and ""Christopher Robin,"" by A.A. Milne.

FALSE,B-,Terry Melcher,Terry Melcher,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7416,"
Most will find this producer's daydream sterile at best and noxious at worst, but I like the song about his shrink and am fascinated by his compulsion to defend his Manson connections. With the requisite show of wealth and taste, he insists that he's only a spectator--why, he wouldn't even know about the hand jive if it weren't for Soul Train. Alternate title: It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Watching.

FALSE,B-,Big Daddy,John Cougar Mellencamp,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5455,"
He's miserable because his half-earned success gets him more love than his hard-fought principles, because he still isn't sure what justice is, because his bones creak, because he's an American fool. He wrote the 11 originals sans band for a Woody Guthrie feel, as if structure were the secret, and as rendered by said band they sound so loose-limbed that at first you may blame yourself for not loving the shit out of them. But every one bogs down in his bitter pretensions, as Mellencamp must suspect. Why else would he sneak in the devastating unannounced cover (nonvinyl-only, principle fans) of the 1967 one-shot ""Let It All Hang Out,"" where four loose-limbed fools who never heard of Woody Guthrie achieved the feel he's striving for without even trying--in hopes of becoming pop singers, yet. The loss of grace it signifies could make anybody miserable.

Ziggy Marley owes Bob for his voice and his band, and he's not just whistling ""I Shot the Sheriff"" when he thanks him for ""spiritual inspiration"" as well--without it this record would be empty, voice and band notwithstanding. What's still missing is not only his father's genius but his father's experience. Here's hoping the spiritual inspiration is potent enough to keep the kid from trying to substitute musical experience for the life kind.

FALSE,B-,Master of Puppets,Metallica,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5460,"
I feel at a generational disadvantage with this music not because my weary bones can't take its power and speed but because I was born too soon to have my dendrites rerouted by progressive radio. This band's momentum can be pretty impressive, and as with a lot of fast metal (as well as some sludge) they seem to have acceptable political motivations--antiwar, anticonformity, even anticoke, fine. But the revolutionary heroes I envisage aren't male chauvinists too inexperienced to know better; they don't have hair like Samson and pecs like Arnold Schwarzenegger. That's the image Metallica calls up, and I'm no more likely to invoke their strength of my own free will than I am The 1812 Overture's.

The jazzy coda doesn't ruin ""Sky High,"" ""Deed to Texas"" is chauvinism at its most forgivable, and in general this is good fun. But though Meyers has grown as a singer he has nothing to add to ""Release Me,"" and though he half-earns the right to contribute seven of his own songs I bet he knows ""Baby, Baby"" is sheer filler.

FALSE,B-,No Frills,Bette Midler,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5466,"
Although it helps that she gets stronger material than usual from yet another phalanx of International Pop Music Community pros, what makes this Bette's best studio album in a decade is a Habana production number set in Miami, a newly written Sophie Tucker song about a driving wheel, and not-quite-comic readings of Marshall Crenshaw and Jagger-Richard. What makes it not good enough is the curse of Broadway rock and roll--the beat is conceived as decoration or signal rather than the meaning of life, or even music.

FALSE,B-,Kickin',Mighty Clouds of Joy,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7435,"
Dave Crawford, whose debut production with this group explored the spiritual affinities between showbiz gospel and studio soul, here returns to form by exploiting shared commercial asininities. Don't be fooled if they get the great exception, ""Mighty High,"" onto DJ turntables; Joe Ligon singing ""You Are So Beautiful"" is even more depressing than Billy Preston.

As a spacey rock prophet he's terrible (who isn't?). As a blues singer he's incompetent (I wouldn't come on in his kitchen for a glass of water). But as a purveyor of spacey pop-rock blues, he has his virtues. Question: what the hell is ""the pompitous of love""? The Medallions wouldn't tell me.

Chicago's Anglodisco clones meet Anglodisco renegade Adrian Sherwood and promptly improve themselves by trading in wimpy on arty. Fleetingly gothic, marginally industrial, unrelenting in a vaguely threatening way, they shout ""The world is ending"" on a crowded dancefloor.

As with so many middle-class suburban Amerindies whose music starts hazy, they're making atmosphere their vocation. Problem's less tunes than lyrics, and less the way the lyrics make evocation their vocation than what they evoke--New Yorker poems about mowing the lawn, rather than just mowing the lawn.

FALSE,B-,Miles of Aisles,Joni Mitchell,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7451,"
The two Joni-with-guitar/piano/dulcimer sides of this live double are impossibly tedious even though she's learned to sing songs that were beyond her half a decade ago--if she was so crazy about folkie-purist records she would have gone that way in the studio originally. The two new songs are mere bait--they wouldn't be on the album if she'd recorded them before. And the two sides with the L.A. Express establish her as the most gifted of the new folky-jazzy singers--I mean, Kenny Rankin should just forget it.

FALSE,B-,Don Juan's Reckless Daughter,Joni Mitchell,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1845,"
This double album presents a real critic's dilemma--I'm sure it's boring, but I'm not sure how boring. Insofar as it isn't, Jaco Pastorius deserves as much credit as the artiste. Just the way it did on Hejira, his bass enables her to deal with the syntheses that obsess her--melody and rhythm, form and anima. But only on the title cut does he enable her to realize them.

FALSE,B-,Ping Pong,Momus,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5329,"
In one of his many clever songs, Nick Currie compares his quest for fame to God's and wonders why the big fella gets all the coverage. The answer is that God is a nicer guy. Performers like Currie believe ""all interesting behaviors, whether moral or not, are salable in our culture"" because they don't have much choice--it's that or a day job. But no matter how well-turned the lyric, very few listeners actually enjoy songs in which snobbish dandies trot out their sexual egomania and baby envy. Deep down, most people have some cornball in them. And this is a good thing.

FALSE,B-,Carryin' On,Montgomery Gentry,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10325,"
A tuneful, hard-hitting case study in the conservatism of the ""rock"" claimed by studio hotshots wherever popular music is manufactured in our once-great land. It's possible to imagine the identical beats and licks vitalized by, say, a younger John Anderson. But mixing them with male chauvinist reaction makes more sense, and turns them rancid. At a time when female spunk has become a Nashville clich������������������, these two putative roadhouse rats, one the brother of cowboy-hat millionaire John Michael Montgomery, inhabit a worl""rock"" because they're ""rebels,"" only what they rebel against is the present, in male-specific terms: ""They say this way of life is done/But not for my father's son."" Like their antecedent Charlie Daniels, they beg the question of whether they're also that kind of rebel. But attention ought be paid another high-profile couplet: ""It ain't nobody's business what kind of flag I fly/'Cause that's my right."" Uh-uh, stupid. The way flags work is that they're the business of everybody who sees them. That's why you fly them high--and why the other side tears them down.

Except for a strange ""Spirit in the Sky"" (she does it straight, whatever that means) and a few other stirring renditions of white people's music (who besides BS&amp;T can ruin ""Hi De Ho""?) this attempt by and with the young woman who sang lead on ""Oh Happy Day"" succeeds only moderately.

Not just guitarless but wholly synthesized, with Junie's all too childish falsetto playing daddy to a smurf club, this is as half-assed as most P-Funk spinoffs even if it wastes a few more ideas. I'd like to hear a bigger artist take over. Think maybe George would mastermind a total remix of ""Break 6""?

FALSE,B-,Hard Nose the Highway,Van Morrison,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4093,"
The relaxed rhythms are just lax most of the time, the vocal surprises mild after St. Dominic's Preview, the lyrics dumbest when they're more than mood pieces, and the song construction offhand except on ""Warm Love.""
"
FALSE,B-,Common One,Van Morrison,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4100,"
Sententious, torpid, abandoned by God, this six-song, fifty-five minute meander is Morrison's worst since Hard Nose the Highway--Astral Weeks fans even think so. He does have a direct line to certain souls, though, and they still hear him talkin'. As in fact do I, twice--on the only vaguely fast one, which goes ""I'm satisfied/With my world,"" and on the truly nutball ""Summer in England,"" which goes ""Did you ever hear about/Wordsworth and Coleridge, baby?""
"
FALSE,B-,Inarticulate Speech of the Heart,Van Morrison,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5496,"
In this troubled time, rock-and-rollers have every right to place their faith in the Jehovah's Witnesses or even Scientology when they discover that Jackie Wilson didn't say it all. But to follow one with the other appears weakminded, like praising Omar Khayyam in tandem with Kahlil Gibran. A hypothesis which the static romanticism of these reels-for-Hollywood-orchestra and other slow songs bears out.

"
FALSE,B-,Absolutely Free,The Mothers of Invention,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10995,"
This well-paced, well-pastiched ""oratorio"" might be of compelling interest to the sort of avant-garde composer whose work incorporates pop usages; after all, here we have genuine pop musicians doing the obverse. But as rock and roll it's a moderately amusing novelty record, much too obvious in its satire, with harmonies and time changes that presage Yes and Jethro Tull rather than ELP and the Moody Blues. Best cut: ""Call Any Vegetable.""
"
FALSE,B-,Shazam,The Move,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7470,"
Its enthusiasts to the contrary, this is hardly the greatest rock and roll record ever to thump down the pike. It's just an artier version of the overly self-conscious mode I call stupid-rock, simultaneously gargantuan and prissy, like dinosaurs galumphing through the tulips. It would be a lot worse if it weren't so funny, but it would also be a lot less funny if it were a little better. Recommended to Stooges fans who just found a five-dollar bill.

FALSE,B-,Black Woman,Judy Mowatt,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5510,"
Mowatt seems like an exceptionally decent person. Her avowals of sisterhood are a welcome corrective to Rasta sexism. But as a frontwoman she's a backup singer. The straightforward decorum of her timbre suits her fine, but her lack of inborn dramatic grace and soul technique make her modest tunes more tedious than they have to be. And I don't hear the boys in the band putting their backs into it.

Replaces the two filthy cuts that gave Pristine Smut its name with one called ""La-Di-Da"" that says it all and an I-had-a-hit-and-you-didn't Go-Go's collaboration. They were cuter with slime on their pudenda. Docked one notch apiece for pusillanimity.

FALSE,B-,Snowbird,Anne Murray,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7483,"
An honest if rather clumsy pop country album from the Canadian who had a well-deserved hit with the title song. Her corny and superfluous ""Get Together"" is more than made up for by (believe it or not) the best cover version of ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight"" I know, and if ""Running"" is a little stiff, you tell me how many other pop country artists sing the praises of draft dodging.
"
FALSE,B-,I'll Always Love You,Anne Murray,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7490,"
Murray's third album with Jim Ed Norman continues her gradual revitalization. Norman does clean, honest, Nashville-quality work, Murray gives forth with the old sensible spunk, and the singles break country and cross over just like they're supposed to. But the potential a few of us perceived in her five years ago is gone. Then Murray seemed to have a shot at women's pop, in the honorific way that term was used after Warhol and the Beatles--a Canadian gym teacher who could rock and roll, a militantly ordinary audience with a lesbian fringe. Now she's just quality MOR, singing the El Lay songbook (only two Canadian composers here, one of whom is Jesse Winchester) like a down-to-earth Emmylou, or Linda without charisma. Which means that exactly how good her records come out no longer matters.
"
FALSE,B-,Outcry,Mutabaruka,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5521,"
The man has his merits: ""Rememberance"" rallies consciousness around the grim history of black oppression, and ""Sisters Poem"" goes a healthy halfway toward opposing Rastafarian sexism. But too often he's just smart enough to be dumb. What he has in mind for the sisters is the pious pedestal of ""Black Queen."" Those pondering the Palestinian conundrum may be surprised to learn that ""Canaan Lan"" will revert to the sons of Ham come millennium time. And any well-meaning white lefty who wonders why U.S.-born blacks don't always rush into common cause with West Indians, not to mention well-meaning white lefties, should check out ""Blacks in 'Merika,"" yet another vague, patronizing, moralistic, ignorant tract imposed from yet another outside.
"
FALSE,B-,I Am . . .,Nas,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2505,"
Nas covers his ahzz. If in one song he's ""wetting"" (lovely word) ""any nigga"" (another) his fellow playa Scarface doesn't like, in another he's fomenting revolution: ""Combine all the cliques and make one gang."" Yeah sure. The question is how convincing he is, and only two themes ring true: the bad ones, revenge and money. His idea of narrative detail is to drop brand names like Bret Easton Ellis; his idea of morality is everybody dies. Ghostface Killah's ""Wildflower"" is far more brutal than the she-cheated-while-I-was-playin ""Undying Love,"" and far less bloody; Biggie's ""Playa Hater"" is far more brutal than the Wu-Puff cameo ""Hate Me Now,"" and far more humorous. Blame his confusion and bad faith on a conscience that's bothered him ever since he bought into the Suge Knight ethos. I've never met a ho in my life. This kind of sellout starts with a ""W.""

FALSE,B-,Rudy the Fifth,Rick Nelson and the Stone Canyon Band,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11715,"
It's reassuring to learn there are constants in this changing world. A dozen years ago, Nelson was a better than average fake, and he's still a better-than-average fake. This is a pleasant record and I would go see him in a club in Denver any time--country-rock at least as good as, shall we say, Poco.

FALSE,B-,Garden Party,Rick Nelson and the Stone Canyon Band,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7497,"
This is the music ""no one heard"" at the Garden party because Rick ""didn't look the same."" Despite such titles as ""Are You Really Real?"" and ""A Flower Opens Gently By"" he has some reason to pout if music rather than songs is the operative concept--the band is concentrated, jagged. Best music: Chuck Berry's ""I'm Talking About You."" Second-best song: Rick's own ""So Long Mama.""
"
FALSE,B-,Red Headed Stranger,Willie Nelson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4171,"
This tale of a murdering preacher wild in his abandonment has inspired much loose talk about violence and Western myth. Ed Ward argues that the Stranger is a fantasy of vengeance rejected on side two, but all I hear is that he's redeemed by another woman there--if she leaves him, he'll kill her too. Some of the individual pieces are quite nice, but the gestalt is the concept album at its most counterproductive--the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts unnecessarily ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context.
"
FALSE,B-,The Sound in Your Mind,Willie Nelson,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7502,"
""That Lucky Old Sun"" sounds better than ""Amazing Grace""; Steve Fromholz's ""I'd Have to Be Crazy"" sounds better than Willie's ""The Sound in Your Mind."" Willie had better watch it--Major Artists can't grind out Product the way Country Music Stars do or people'll start thinkin' they're slippin'.

Needless to say, he also outsings Kristofferson, and without much extra in the god-given department, though the high note that climaxes ""Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends"" is a doozy. But his inborn tact is wasted on this material. As Al Green, Janis Joplin, Elvis Presley, and even Ray Price have proven, the way to put such arrant corn across is to pull out the stops.

I enjoy this entry all right, with ""Why Do I Have To Choose,"" a cheating song without a moral, the high point. But two things bother me. First, I prefer the songs I've never heard before to those I'm acquainted with to those I know well. Second, Waylon adds something.
"
FALSE,B-,One for the Road,Willie Nelson & Leon Russell,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7503,"
As the duo dueted swingingly through ""I Saw the Light"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel"" on the first of these four sides, I thought Willie had somehow gotten away with yet another triumphant nonalbum, but the slack B-Western self-parody of ""Don't Fence Me In"" and ""Sioux City Sue"" on side two set me straight. And sides three and four, where Leon accompanies Willie through another batch of stardust, are a mistake--even if the music were as good (compare this ""Lucky Old Sun"" to the one on Sound in Your Mind), it's too soon for a reprise. Frank Sinatra he's not.

FALSE,B-,Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma,Michael Nesmith,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7509,"
The Smart Monkee has turned into the Young Herb Alpert, rock's most successful artist-businessman. Pacific Arts, which he owns outright, has purchased his RCA masters for reissue and released albums by such artists as Charles Lloyd. It's also put out Nesmith's ghastly boxed audio-allegory-with-book The Prison, his desultory reputed cult album From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing, his live LP, and now this intelligent, hard-rocking item. What's not clear is whether the records make money--TV commercials are the company's staple. Though Nesmith hasn't sounded this good in years, there's a difference between the pop eccentric he's become and the country-rock eccentric he used to be--he's now a little behind the times instead of ahead of them. Still beats most of what the majors market as power pop. But the only necessity he conveys is a continuing compulsion to make music. And that's not sufficient.
"
FALSE,B-,Family Groove,The Neville Brothers,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5879,"
On a braver album, ""Fly Like an Eagle"" might be a coup, freedom fighters seizing the '60s-are-over sentimentality of a pop tune about a revolution Steve Miller wasn't so sorry we lost. On this record it's a reproach--the hook no song doctor can sell. Socially conscious, romantically ardent, or trading on their good name, their material just sits there waiting for you to like it. Where on the notorious Uptown they were a confused CHR band who deserved more airplay than they got, here they're a second-rate commercial funk band who get more than they deserve. At least Aaron's Ronstadt outing had the courage of her aesthetic convictions.

FALSE,B-,Looks Like Rain,Mickey Newbury,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7510,"
Sounds like rain, too--also wind, train whistles, ghosts, humming, whistling, electric sitars, and Norman Luboff. If the Mystic Moods Orchestra is Jerry Kennedy's idea of artistic production, he should stick to putting five pieces behind Jerry Lee and Tom T. But my guess is that it's Mickey's. The man is, or can be, a great songwriter, but this lady who left him because she was sad has thrown him into a depression so interesting he wants to savor every drop--almost ruins ""She Even Woke Me Up to say Goodbye"" by taking it too slow. Never trust meteorological symbolism--never.

Although the object of Slade the Leveller's fury isn't hard to figure out--""She'll dance on our graves"" doesn't refer to his mum--the analysis on the three new studio songs is a bit metaphorical for such a populist band. What white coats? What Valley of Death? What Chinese whispers? The live best-of on the B is a live best-of plus half an unannounced sea chantey.

With a kick in her pert little butt from John Travolta, the Melbourne chameleon has abandoned her conquest of Nashville for a funkier brand of perky, with seven more top-ten singles her reward, and she's sexier than Barbara Mandrell for damn sure. Any heterosexual man who can deny ""Physical,"" with its detonating blonde bombshell switching off from ""physical"" to ""animal"" for the grand finale, needs his monkey-gland shot--to dismiss it as an aerobics song is brunette chauvinism, period.

FALSE,B-,In God We Trust,Don Nix,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7529,"
Although he's a white fella, Nix is something of a fixture on the Memphis blues-soul scene, and the music here is passable in the manner of fixtures on the Memphis blues-soul scene--despite a few bizarre and distracting insertions by septuagenarian bluesman Furry Lewis, which constitute an in-joke characteristic of fixtures etc. Its abiding interest is as an almost unfathomable example of downhome antireligious irony. At least I think it's anti.
"
FALSE,B-,Neon Golden,The Notwist,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12275,"
Not a fraud. That much I'll grant this evolving German unit's career album. There are tunes, and they're nicely melded to a wide assortment of putatively nonmusical sounds. Not pretentious either, though to say anything kinder about Markus Archer's command of English is to make hope a vice. Also, not cold--lukewarm at least. But then what? Not dynamic? Not exciting? Not much fun? Young people who think Kraftwerk were more important than the Ramones are free to satisfy their craving for the neu with this retreat into simplicity. But even Radiohead and Mouse on Mars contain more chaos. And the chaos is still out there.
"
FALSE,B-,Wild Weekend,NRBQ,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5555,"
First cute, then peculiar, then annoying, their callow act is turning positively perverse as they twinkle-toe past 40. ""Boy's Life"" and ""Immortal for a While"" are only where they state their interest in so many words--everywhere Joey Spampinato's eager eternal-adolescent whine rubs up against Terry Adams's sly grownup changes. They may be smart enough to consider this a creative tension, but it isn't. It's an evasion--a fib as opposed to a lie, kiddies--and it isn't funny anymore.
"
FALSE,B-,Free-for-All,Ted Nugent,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7536,"
Side one is well-wrought heavy metal--tensile and clever, reminiscent of Deke Leonard only clearer. Side two is the usual frantic melodrama.
"
FALSE,B-,Gonna Take a Miracle,Laura Nyro,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7539,"
In which the Bronx tearjerker reveals the source of her gloppy sensibility--good old girl-group rock and roll. Which is fine, except that glop tastes best prepared according to the traditional recipes, rather than disguised as untrammeled lyricism the way it is here. Might be different if Nyro were Aretha Franklin, as is painfully obvious every time she shows off the high part of her famous range. Still, backup singers Labelle don't screech once, Gamble &amp; Huff control the rhythm section if not the artiste, and two of the ten remakes are ear-openers: ""I Met Him on a Sunday,"" which begins acappella, and ""Monkey Time/Dancing in the Street,"" which rocks.
"
FALSE,B-,Smile,Laura Nyro,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7540,"
The momentum of the Moments' ""Sexy Mama"" does her nicely through ""Children of the Junks,"" in which r&amp;b goes to Hong Kong, and ""Money,"" the second straight track to use the word ""tax-free,"" although it ends ominously, with instructions to ""make your vibe go round."" And sure enough, this gasps on from there like a novice practicing circular breathing. I'd say that after four years she's out of training, but she's never been in training.
"
FALSE,B-,Season of Lights: Laura Nyro in Concert,Laura Nyro,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7541,"
Most rock and rollers are too loose on live albums, but Nyro gets so carried away in the studio that the unerasable living band insures relatively straightforward remakes. My favorite moment, though, is when she introduces the musicians in a speaking voice nasal enough to make Dion sound Delta born-and-raised--finally I understand why Bronxites love her. I await explanations from Queens.
"
FALSE,B-,Beatitude,Ric Ocasek,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5564,"
They say Ocasek forces it with the Cars, but Shake It Up sounded too relaxed, while this solo effort is tense throughout. And if instrumentally the effect is bracing, vocally it's constipated: only on the avuncular ""Jimmy Jimmy"" do his affections (not to mention his pretensions) have any roughage to them.
"
FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits,Phil Ochs,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7542,"
Sporting his gold lame suit and boasting that ""50 Phil Ochs fans can't be wrong!,"" the Singing Yippie bids for pop power once again on this prematurely entitled work of art. Van Dyke Parks's classy, countrified production suits Phil's strange lyricism a lot better than the baroque excesses of Pleasures of the Harbor, but in the end Ochs's compulsive sweetness does him in anyway. It's always been one of the prime paradoxes of folkiedom that our most astringent protester should come on like Richard Dyer-Bennett gone Nashville, and the sad truth is that the lone protest number is the weakest cut on the disappointing second side. But even the first side, as strong as any pop Ochs has written to date, works in spite of his voice. Fond as I am of ""James Dean of Indiana,"" I think it would be even more haunting done deadpan, by Arlo Guthrie or Tom T. Hall.
"
FALSE,B-,Universal Mother,Sin����,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5911,"
I confess this has grown on me. The quiet, stunning ""All Apologies"" is only the latest proof of the vocal gift--part physical (clarity, texture, amplitude), part spiritual (openness, commitment)--that can make her a great cover artist. Her lullaby is a stroke, and her signoff love song arrives at a nicely unreadable tone. But from Germaine Greer's great mother of a prologue (performancewise, Farrakhan's got the sister beat) to the weeper that could tempt Bruno Bettelheim to tell moron jokes (just precisely who does ""scorn"" the little retard, anyway?) to the instructional rap that'll catch your ear so fast you'll waste scarcely a second pushing the next-track button (no famine OK, ""post traumatic stress disorder"" blarney), the framing could be a parody conceived by son of Eire P.J. O'Rourke, and it renders the album essentially inaccessible. This isn't risking foolishness--it's flaunting it.
"
FALSE,B-,Odyssey,Odyssey,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7543,"
Native New Yorkers who just can't wait anymore for the next Dr. Buzzard have turned to this, in which the Dr.'s producer once again weaves meaningful lyrics into a texture discrete enough not to digest its own strands. But the sad truth is that words and music here are much less dry, audacious, and, well, hip. For me, they evoke the Anglophile West Indies rather than the barrio.
"
FALSE,B-,Contradiction,Ohio Players,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7549,"
""Contradiction"" and ""Far East Mississippi"" are in such a no-bullshit mode that they can get away with change-of-pace woo-pitchers, although they've done better than these. But, like Gerald Ford, they can't get away with ""Bi-Centennial.""
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of the Early Years Volume 1,Ohio Players,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7550,"
A misnomer--should be Early Year. To be precise, 1972, when they released both Pain and Pleasure. Suggested retitle: Half Pain and Half Pleasure.
"
FALSE,B-,Message in the Music,The O'Jays,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7556,"
The message in the message is inoffensive enough to let the message in the music come through; my favorite lines (not that I don't have unfavorites): ""Heaven is just a condition/Hell is a condition too."" But the music never peaks; the songs are too medium, if you know what I mean, their pleasures bound up in performance subtleties that ought to be hooked, at least once, onto something obvious.
"
FALSE,B-,Danny O'Keefe,Danny O'Keefe,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7559,"
Though he thinks too much about smog and winos, O'Keefe sings the blues like a good old boy and takes his ""mama"" with him when he leaves town--in short, handles standard new-troubadourisms with some originality. And every once in a while he writes a potential standard like ""Sweet Rollin'"" (femme fatale) or ""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues"" (a rounder's tragedy). But producer Ahmet Ertegun stifles ""Saturday Morning"" in Shoals soul, arranges ""Steel Guitar"" sans steel guitar, and indulges all of his boy's most misguided pretensions.
"
FALSE,B-,Black Foliage: Animation Music,The Olivia Tremor Control,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3742,"
This division of the Elephant 6 consortium loves tunes, and its soundscaping has few equals in indiedom. When it mixes the two, the result is often kinda beautiful even though the lyrics are avowedly ""not going to shed any new light on humanity,"" and even though the sonics tend toward the perverse-disembodied outtake snippets, mechanical malfunctions, and tape fuckups that their hip-hop counterparts would bury in beats or declare inimical to organic life. But as the album goes on (and on), the strategy becomes not noize-toon synthesis, but weird song as reward for unpleasant sound. At its most generous, this may be the music of the young Brian Wilson's dysfunctional dreams. But at its most pretentious it's his bad trip. And bad trips weren't the main reason the psychedelic worldview fell into disrepute. The main reason was that it was full of shit.
"
FALSE,B-,It's Alright,Yoko Ono,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5576,"
Supposedly a big shrewdie, Yoko is transcendently simplistic at the core, which in many ways worked better when she was an avant-gardist than it does in her belated pop phase. This somewhat presumptuous message of hope to the world is cunningly devised around the edges--she exploits the studio with fifty years' and countless dollars' worth of childlike delight. but back at the core, the singing and the songs are more one-dimensional than good pop ever is.
"
FALSE,B-,Starpeace,Yoko Ono,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5577,"
Bill Laswell looked like the perfect choice to assist Yoko's rebound from It's Alright, especially given his commitment to non-Western music and his penchant for avant-gardists, mostly jazzmen but a few of Yoko's ilk. But despite unfailingly humorless lyrics and the skillful input of Laswell regulars from Aiyb Dieng to Anton Fier, the result is insistently, self-consciously, and rather clumsily light in the head. Often it tries to be cute, which is difficult for anyone and utterly impossibly for Laswell, who isn't exactly a froth specialist. Sure he helps with the hooks and beats, that's his job, but the overall effect is as joyless as the kind of record Toto might cut for a girlfriend of their manager's--the soulless studio-rock anti-intellectuals have always accused him of making. Great exception: ""You and I,"" a silly love song for Sean.
"
FALSE,B-,U.F. Orb,The Orb,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3745,"
Travelogue techno. Hassell &amp; Eno, Budd &amp; Eno, Steve Reich, Steve Spielberg, Augustus Pablo, Davy Jones, all watered down for your trippy delectation. Not terrible, exactly, but rather silly. Free your mind and you can dance to anything.
"
FALSE,B-,Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted,The Original Animals,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7564,"
Not bad for a reunion LP--a lot more authentic sounding than the Byrds'. But then, the Animals weren't as good as the Byrds. And the only time Eric Burdon really recaptures that old white magic is on ""Many Rivers to Cross,"" such a cliche by now that only a singer as crude as Eric, with his desperate key changes and random enthusiasm, can bring it to life. Me, I'll take ""Sky Pilot.""
"
FALSE,B-,Straight From the Basement of Kooley High!,Original Concept,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5580,"
A couple of years ago these guys released two mysterious singles with almost nothing on them but bass, buzz, beats, and offhand joshing. One of those singles is lost among the protests, admonitions, sexism, camaraderie, laugh lines, true stories, and samples of this professional rap album. It's the old rock and roll story--a lot of knowledge can also be a dangerous thing.
"
FALSE,B-,Woyaya,Osibisa,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7568,"
I don't want to say they're hokey, but this is their second consecutive album to begin with jungle sounds, and I think we get the point. Actually, the problem is that they're not hokey enough, or not in the right way--plenty of quasi-virtuoso jams and brother-brother-brother, but nothing tricky enough to echo in your head once the drums have faded away.
"
FALSE,B-,Heads,Osibisa,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7569,"
When it comes to lists of cities visited on tour, I'll take James Brown--he's got a better beat, maybe even a more African one. But if you happen to be in one of those cities on the appointed night, you should probably try to hear them--their records have never come up to their live notices.
"
FALSE,B-,"""Addictions"" Volume 1",Robert Palmer,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5588,"
Is this fraud really the Dorian Gray wannabee of jacket photos? I don't know, and unless the women he beds are a lot more interesting than the models who populate his videos, I don't even want you to tell me. Rather than a tax-exiled roue, I prefer to imagine him as a secret straight who takes the fast train to his modest Surrey estate after a hard day's posing in London, arriving in time for a civilized dinner with wife and children before plopping in front of the VCR with a bottle of cognac. Honesty compels me to acknowledge, however, that my wife doesn't think he's a fraud--once spied him buying groceries just around the corner, and liked what she saw. In a world where male rock critics get Sheena Easton and Kim Gordon--who owns Palmer's only great song, ""Addicted to Love,"" the way Junior Tucker owns ""Some Guys Get All the Luck""--she's got a right. But I still give the grades around here.
"
FALSE,B-,The Parkerilla,Graham Parker and the Rumour,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5617,"
If you think it's a little early for a concert album by Parker, who's not exactly Peter Frampton on the rackjobber circuit, you're right, but only if you view this--three live sides plus one 33-rpm single (the fourth version of ""Don't Ask Me Questions"" Parker has put on disc)--as music, or product. Regard it instead as a gambit designed to terminate his contract with Mercury. The music that fleshes out the gambit has a nice intensity that gets left out of those nasty rumors. But none of the songs are new and none of the remakes revelatory.
"
FALSE,B-,Steady Nerves,Graham Parker and the Shot,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5591,"
""I'm not exactly into humor,"" he observes in ""Canned Laughter,"" and truer words were never spoken--unless you count ""Mercury Poisoning,"" I don't think he's cracked a joke in ten years. So maybe he should give it a try. I know sensitivity didn't work. But squeezing out one more round of angry hooks doesn't work either.
"
FALSE,B-,Chartbusters,Ray Parker Jr.,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5786,"
Greatest Hits is definitive, ""Ghostbusters"" a contemporary classic available in seven- and twelve-inch formats, and this a redundancy from an artist whose contract is coming up.
"
FALSE,B-,Sex and the Single Man,Ray Parker Jr.,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5787,"
Maybe Ray is getting jaded--pussy comes so easy now that he no longer bothers to hone his come-on. Whether he's scoring on sensitivity (oh really, ""Men Have Feelings Too""?) or studsmanship (though I do enjoy the bone and puddy-tat lines in ""I'm a Dog""), he's putting out just enough to get her into the car. The sole exception is ""I'm in Love,"" in which a workaholic falls for ""an interesting girl"" who doesn't have a job. Workaholic--now that sounds like the real Ray to me.
"
FALSE,B-,Trombipulation,Parliament,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5791,"
Reports of George Clinton's demise are premature, but there's reason to worry about his body tone. Although the transcendent silliness of ""Agony of Defeet"" recalls past glories, the quotes from Bach, Brylcreem, and Mother Goose are dim echoes of the sharp confidence games of yore, and on occasion this sounds kind of like Fuzzy Haskins &amp; Co. Hmm.
"
FALSE,B-,Sleepless Nights,Gram Parsons/The Flying Burrito Brothers,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5621,"
These cover versions--some cut with Emmylou, some with the Bros., all but two previously unreleased--were outtakes for a reason (shaky vocals and/or conceptual irrelevance, usually), and they don't make him any more alive. For archivists only.
"
FALSE,B-,Jolene,Dolly Parton,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5624,"
""Jolene"" proves that sometimes she's a great singer-songwriter. ""I Will Always Love You"" proves that sometimes she's a good one. Porter Wagoner's ""Lonely Comin' Down"" proves that sometimes she should just sing. Her own ""Highlight of My Life"" proves that sometimes she should just shut up. And the rest proves nothing.
"
FALSE,B-,New Harvest . . . First Gathering,Dolly Parton,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5628,"
Aficionados complain that her sellout has become audible, but while I admit that the cute squeals on ""Applejack"" are pure merchandising, she's always been willing to sell what she couldn't give away. I think Dolly has made the pop move a lot more naturally than, say, Tanya Tucker. The problem here afflicts every genre: material.
"
FALSE,B-,Heartbreak Express,Dolly Parton,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5793,"
If Willie and Merle, her equals as country artists, can turn into premier pop singers, why can't Dolly? Maybe because she's justifiably smitten with her physical gifts. Just as she can't resist pushup bras, she can't resist oversinging, showing off every curve of a gorgeous voice that's still developing new ones. On the other hand, maybe it has to do with why she wears wigs, which if I'm not mistaken is because she doesn't really like her hair.
"
FALSE,B-,360 Degrees of Billy Paul,Billy Paul,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5630,"
At his worst, Paul is black naturalness at its most mannered--florid, hyped up, homiletic, sort of a Les McCann of small-time jazz singers. But Gamble and Huff have been making great music out of middlebrow jazz for years, and when they give Paul a good song--several of the black-consciousness riffs, which G&amp;H seem to turn out as if they were so many follow-ups to ""Tighten Up,"" are better than ""Me and Mrs. Jones""--his overstatement is no more offensive than Ray Charles's. On stupid, unrealistic songs (e.g., ""I'm Just a Prisoner"") he sounds stupid and unrealistic, which figures.
"
FALSE,B-,Take This Job and Shove It,Johnny Paycheck,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11367,"
If this is proof that country is the real working-class music, then the only oppressor the working man knows is the woman whose pedestal he supports and the only right he demands is the right to cry in his beer. There's enough anomie, male bonding, and random violence on this record to inspire one cover story on whither outlaw and another on whither punk, and although it offers numerous insights, I wish I believed just a few of them were as intentional as the catchiness of the tunes.
"
FALSE,B-,The Teaches of Peaches,Peaches,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10061,"
Not cock-rock, bukkake-rock. And though you may be lucky enough not to know what that means, Peaches had better. Doesn't matter whether she's a performance artist, a concept rocker, a bored schoolteacher, or an expat with a gimmick. ""Come on, hot rod/Give me your wad"" etc. is prosex postfeminism for the age of Internet porn, in which thousands of women a day prove how cool they are by smiling through their semen facials. It's wish fulfillment for boys who make passes at girls who wear glasses. And given a beat by Chilly Gonzales's low-techno bump and grind, it's perfect for a fashion industry finally past the embarrassment of junkie chic.
"
FALSE,B-,Tellin' It,Ann Peebles,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5638,"
Peebles's small, rough-cut ruby of a voice can't buy her Aretha's kind of time, her hesitant pursuit of a dramatic frame, an artistic self, will never do the duty of a real persona. Which may mean that Willie Mitchell is wrong for her. Not only does this seamless funk deprive her of the sharply accentuated settings her instrument was created for, but his concentration on music to the exclusion of image leaves her singing warmed-over Millie Jackson wife-and-other-woman lyrics with the wan confusion they deserve.
"
FALSE,B-,The Handwriting Is on the Wall,Ann Peebles,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5640,"
More tough talking about sex and love (and sex)--unfalteringly funky, consistently credible, and mildly enjoyable. Great one: ""Old Man With Young Ideas.""

FALSE,B-,Boppin' the Blues,Carl Perkins and NRBQ,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11068,"
Sorry, folks, Carl just can't wear them shoes no more; he is an aging country singer and he sounds it. As for NRBQ, they were better first time around. Competent and utterly unexciting, except for the cover, which should win an award.
"
FALSE,B-,I Just Want to Sing With My Friends,The Persuasions,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5654,"
Most of side two works despite the horns. But producer-songwriter Jeff Barry's benign poppificiation sounds positively metastatic when counterposed against the arty purity of the few acappella cuts he permits.
"
FALSE,B-,Wildflowers,Tom Petty,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3976,"
If he were a flower, he'd be wilted, but since he's really more a dick, call him torpid. That Rick Rubin, what a laid-back guy.
"
FALSE,B-,Southern Accents,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5611,"
Petty's problem isn't that he's dumb, or even that people think he's dumb, although they have reason to. It's that he feels so sorry for himself he can't think straight. Defending the South made sense back when Ronnie Van Zant was writing ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" but in the Sun Belt era it's just pique. The modernizations of sometime coproducer Dave Stewart mitigate the neoconservative aura somewhat, but unmitigating it right back is Petty's singing, its descent from stylization into affectation most painful on side one's concept songs. Side two is less consequential, and better. Note, however, that its show-stopper is ""Spike,"" in which a bunch of rednecks, I mean good old boys, prepare to whup a punk. It's satire. Yeah sure.
"
FALSE,B-,After Words,Bob Pfeifer,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=396,"
When half of the greatest couple band this side of X makes a solo album that broods obsessively about a broken relationship, we're entitled to our biographical assumptions. Damn right it's more fun to fuss and fight than to sit home feeling sorry for yourself, but the idea is to illuminate this truth, not prove it.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of PG&E,PG&E,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5658,"
You have to sympathize with a band whose tragic history includes the theft of their name--a name greater than Tongue &amp; Groove or Nova Local--by a power monopoly. But this boasts as many moments as they deserve. Charlie Allen synthesizes Taj Mahal and Otis Redding (more Arthur Conley, actually) over a blues-soul ensemble without the chops or drive of the similar bands led by Delaney Bramlett, one of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's producers. The highlight is their only hit, the rousing ""Are You Ready?"" Added attractions include ""Rock and Roller's Lament,"" which is autobiographical, and ""Staggolee,"" which isn't.
"
FALSE,B-,For All We Know,Esther Phillips With Beck,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5666,"
Well, ""What a Diff'rence a Day Makes"" was a hit. So it follows that ""For All We Know"" will be a hit too. Right?

FALSE,B-,Capricorn Princess,Esther Phillips,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5667,"
In which Creed Taylor rescues her from Joe Beck and then immediately swamps her in mush yet again, so that her Janis Ian cover doesn't match the original and her bitter ""All the Way Down"" almost sounds out of place. Q: And what's your sign, Creed? A: $
"
FALSE,B-,All About Esther Phillips,Esther Phillips,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5669,"
I thank Esther for making me hear that ""Native New Yorker"" is about danger and selfishness. But not for the discobeisance and inbred songwriting.
"
FALSE,B-,Farmhouse,Phish,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5321,"
Tuneful, sturdy, unfaltering, bland, it's the pioneering jam band's bid for the market share located some years ago by Dave Matthews. Enthusiasts may even claim it proves they're better than Dave Matthews, as indeed it does, though why that needed proving I couldn't tell you. Inspirational Verse: ""Each betrayal begins with trust/Every man returns to dust."" ""One man gathers what another man spills"" was taken.
"
FALSE,B-,Willie Phoenix,Willie Phoenix,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5672,"
Phoenix knocked me out on sheer pizazz fronting a raw, Beatley band called Romantic Noise at Max's three or four years ago; here he surfaces as a Springsteen convert and almost does it again, although after a dozen plays I wonder whether Romantic Noise's songs matched its pizazz. God knows Phoenix doesn't go for ersatz John Cougar epics--his tribute is all musical style, which since his voice outrings Springsteen's can be pretty impressive until the drama calls your attention to the words.
"
FALSE,B-,I Want You,Wilson Pickett,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5681,"
I'd like him back too, but wishing won't make it so. Half straight disco, half soft--for Pickett--soul, this is a mildly enjoyable album that hasn't broken pop or disco or added a ""Lay Me Like You Hate Me"" to his legend. N.b.: the four (out of seven) best songs are the ones he helped write. Also n.b.: the best of them all is on the disco side.
"
FALSE,B-,Meddle,Pink Floyd,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5683,"
Not bad. ""Echoes"" moves through 23:21 of ""Across the Universe"" cop with the timeless calm of interstellar overdrive, and the acoustic-type folk songs boast their very own melodies (as well as a real dog, rather than electronic seagulls, for sound effect). The word ""behold"" should never cross their filters again, but this is definitely an improvement: one eensy-weensy step for humanity, one giant step for Pink Floyd.
"
FALSE,B-,The Wall,Pink Floyd,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2777,"
For a dumb tribulations-of-a-rock-star epic, this isn't bad--unlikely to arouse much pity or envy, anyway. The music is all right, too--kitschy minimal maximalism with sound effects and speech fragments. But the story is confused, ""mother"" and ""modern life"" make unconvincing villains, and if the recontextualization of ""up against the wall"" is intended ironically, I don't get it.
"
FALSE,B-,Artifakts (BC),Plastikman,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5325,"
One needn't feel deep sympathy for the minimalist project to find use and pleasure in the right Brian Eno or David Behrman, or to conclude that, all subjective affinities aside, Tangerine Dream were full of it. Richie Hawtin is at once sparer and beatier, but not by much, and anyone who would sit there for an hour finding out where he's going has too much time to kill. The belated third volume of a trilogy whose earlier installments I dutifully checked out and guiltlessly discarded, this climaxes midway through with an uncanny evocation of static going down the drain before breaking into a cute little piece of electrofunk that might be sampled by someone with more to say. Then it moves on to Tangerine Dream.

FALSE,B-,Everywhere at Once,The Plimsouls,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5703,"
I explain the ""underground"" rep of these L.A. power-poppers by asking myself whether I wouldn't be mystified by the Fleshtones if I lived in L.A. As befits an L.A. band, they make more of a show of hitcraft, martialing coherent lyrics to actual emotional effect on a couple of slower ones, and less of a show of partymania. And I don't like the Fleshtones' records a whole lot either.

FALSE,B-,Buster Goes Berserk,Buster Poindexter,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5709,"
Be kind and call it Bette Midler's Disease. Or remember what they used to say (stupidly, but why quibble) about the Dolls: you had to be there. Even then the flat-on-its-face overstatement of recorded Buster is pretty appalling. Intimations of minstrelsy he's always subsumed live become all too Negroid with the melon-chomping bass man of ""Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well?,"" even the Sarafina-backed ""All Night Party."" And Buster's no better at bigtime schmaltz than David was. I begrudge him nothing. But I don't want to say thanks for the memories yet.

FALSE,B-,Energy,The Pointer Sisters,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5700,"
With Richard Perry at the helm and the hyperactivity of sister Bonnie channeled into a socially useful project, they reappear here as Linda Ronstadt, in triplicate and with a beat. In other words, these are excellent songs rockingly performed. But there's something overly temperate about the music, and most of the songs have been interpreted more smartly by artists who care as much about words as they do about notes.

FALSE,B-,Pointer Sisters' Greatest Hits,The Pointer Sisters,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5701,"
In the four years since Richard Perry aimed these former eccentrics (see MCA's reretro Retrospect, 1981) at the middle of the radio, they've had three top-ten hits, three top-five hits, three you remember: ""Fire,"" ""Slow Hand,"" ""He's So Shy."" With a couple of minor exceptions, which are also the two remaining top-thirty entries (would markets were always so efficient), everything else has been El Lay assembly-line crapola. Everything Perry included on this kiss-off to Elektra distribution, anyway.

FALSE,B-,Regatta de Blanc,The Police,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3763,"
The idea is to fuse Sting's ringing rock voice and the trio's aggressive, hard-edged rock attack with a less eccentric version of reggae's groove and a saner version of reggae's mix. To me the result sounds half-assed. And though I suppose I might find the ""synthesis"" innovative if I heard as much reggae as they do in England, it's more likely I'd find it infuriating.

FALSE,B-,Together We're Heavy,The Polyphonic Spree,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12599,"
Granted his major-label production budget in the sky, Tim DeLaughter hones his tunes and dispels woozy comparisons to the Flaming Lips. He's on record as wondering why his collective can't have hits like the Association and the 5th Dimension. And when history batters those dreams as it will so many, he'll still have the herewithal to mount a long-running local production of Hair. Even in Dallas, America always makes room for the culture of dissent.

When you're this subtle, marginal differentiation is everything. Louder tracks, sparser samples, less insinuating tunes--all these changes are slight, but they impel antistar-to-die-for Beth Gibbons six inches toward stridency, and she's hard enough to take seriously when she's toning it down. The real and theoretical depressives who adore them will experience this as growth. Workaday music lovers will glance off Gibbons's shows of misery and never figure out why.

A disastrous conceit, in which snippets of a ""theme"" song segue between tracks, makes it very hard to tell what happens to the Big Concept--Elvis Sings Ernest Tubb, Bill Monroe, Bob Wills, Anne Murray, etc. Most of his recordings sound suspiciously casual anyway, like preconcert runthroughs, and these segues add a rushed medley feel. ""The Fool"" and ""It's Your Baby, You Rock It"" work, and ""Whole Lot-ta Shakin'"" works out. But Tubb's ""Tomorrow Never Comes"" is a horn-fed monstrosity. And somehow I don't think Elvis had his heart in ""Snowbird.""

FALSE,B-,Moody Blue,Elvis Presley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5741,"
Despite his capacity for undifferentiated emotion and his utter confidence with almost every kind of American music, Presley didn't automatically impart dignity to anything he laid his voice on the way such natural singers as George Jones and Al Green and Dolly Parton do. Originally a spoiled tough of omnipresent sexual magnetism, he deteriorated into a spoiled stud past his prime, so that while he was always sexy he wasn't always seductive. Whether he's turning it on (""Unchained Melody"") or playing it cool (""Little Darling""), his miscalculations can be embarrassing. But he retains so much presence that he can make two Olivia Newton-John songs sound like country classics indifferently remembered. And when he hits it right, as on the first three tracks of side two, his sincerity, vulnerability, and self-possession are as potent as ever. It seems perfectly suitable that this shoddily conceived LP, pressed on blue plastic for gimmick appeal, should turn into his biggest of the decade on the strength of the ultimate gimmick.

True enough, his songs have become less offensive, but his instrumentals remain in the novelty phase and he still sings like Soul Synth No. 1.

How does an acerbic, good-humored music journeyman like Price (find This Price Is Right, on Parrot) fall in with a pompous, overfed con artist like Lindsay Anderson? By playing the Acerbic, Good-Humoured Music Journeyman Symbol in a pompous, overfed movie. Two or three deft political songs do not redeem an LP that runs 24:43 despite filler. It figures--the movie is an hour (or three hours) too long.

It's no longer so easy to hit consistently in Nashville with such MOR (MOR country, I mean) material, but Pride does it, specializing in happy-marriage songs (which I often find likable) and touching such themes as Jesus, elusive dreams, childhood home, and country-singer-on-the-road (with sex). An achievement, even though he's got a gimmick as well as a voice--which seems to be softening slightly, losing its resonant edge. But especially given how middling his MOR often is, I wish he wanted to do--or is it could do?--more.
"
FALSE,B-,For You,Prince,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5755,"
Like most in-studio one-man bands, the nineteen-year-old kid who pieced this disco-rock-pop-funk concoction together has a weakness for the programmatic--lots of chops, not much challenge. But I like ""Baby,"" about making one, and ""Soft and Wet,"" ditto only he doesn't know it yet. And his falsetto beats Stevie Wonder's, not to mention Emitt Rhodes's.

It's pretty strange, given that he looked like a visionary not long ago. But this arrested adolescent obviously don't know nuthin about nuthin--except maybe his own life, which for all practical purposes ended in his adolescence, since even for a pop star he does his damnedest to keep the world out. So while his sexual fantasies are outrageous only in their callous predictability and his ballads compelling only as shows of technique, they sure beat his reflexive antinomianism and dim politics. Which suggests  why the solid if decidedly unpsychedelic musical pleasures our young craftsman makes available here don't wash. Only the crass ""Raspberry Beret"" and maybe the crooning ""Condition of the Heart"" are worth your time.

Weird. With production by Knox and Jerry (Sons of Sam) Phillips, Prine has never rocked harder. But he's slurring his vocals like some toothless cartoon bluesman emulating an Elvis throwaway--related to the Sun sound, I guess, but perversely. Are the new songs any good? Hard to tell.

FALSE,B-,Kamaal the Abstract,Q-Tip,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14871,"
Arista didn't pull this jazzmatazz off its 2002 release schedule because major labels are evil. Arista pulled it because it stunk. Buried at Track 7, the developed rhyme, unkiltered time, unsettling keyboards, and Kenny Garrett sax coda of ""Abstractionisms"" deliver what the flowery ""Caring"" and the endless ""Do You Dig U?"" emphatically do not: the ""brand new sound"" the finale only brags about. In the narrow sense of rhythm tracks, the beats have some ass to them, but as music they revert to fusion kitsch whenever the artiste sees an opening: swamping the bridge of the trifling ""Heels,"" hogging the back end of the working-girl praise song ""Even If It Is So."" Fact is, without his group this major rapper has been lost musically since 1999. In 2008, he denoodled some on ""The Renaissance and the Abstract Innovations"" mixtape. But though I'm sure there are other cameos I've forgotten or missed, for me his best work of the decade came fronting the Chemical Brothers and freestyling on Kanye West's ""Touch the Sky,"" first immersed in an alien music, then relying on his naked voice.

Dumb, yes. Samey, still. Leiber-Stoller's ""Trouble"" sounds silly--even in that chrome sweat suit, Suzi can't convince me she's evil. And I wish her physical equipment--her medium-sized voice, her static bass playing, and her workmanlike band--were up to her concept and the likable, mostly Chapmann-Chinn material. But I do believe she's tough and independent, and I'd rather hear Quatro shouting out ""Keep a Knockin'"" than a whole album of Maria Muldaur stylizations.

The songs are a shade weaker, but the real problem--and I'm sure Clive Davis had nothing to do with it--is classier arrangements that give her more room to sing. Suzi just doesn't have the stuff to make like an interpreter, whether torching up ""Fever"" or doing a Janis on ""Strip Me."" She lives and dies as a straight-ahead rocker.

This is near enough to the reported mishmash to make me doubt that it sells for what's good about it. Which is that it doesn't actually botch any of a half-dozen arty-to-heavy ""eclectic"" modes--even something called ""Prophet's Song"" sounds OK--and achieves a parodic tone often enough to suggest more than meets the ear. Maybe if they come up with a coherent masterwork I'll figure out what that more is. Maybe if they come up with a coherent masterwork they'll figure out what that more is.

Whether Happy Trails is one of the great live albums or (my theory) one of the greatly overrated ones, Quicksilver needn't have bothered--their studio LPs capture that ballroom ambience right down to the echoed vocals and the imprecise impressionistic accompaniment. And though the debut is more listenable, this beats it for sheer documentary charm. Complete with twin guitars and a ""Ladies Section"" on the jacket comprising twenty-six first names, here is the quintessential Frisco band--its writing folky without the roots, its playing jazzy without the chops, its concepts unencumbered by any sense of form. The big news is the return of Dino Valenti, but the big attraction is the quintessential Quicksilver anthem, ""Fresh Air,"" as in ""Have another hit."" Plus those twin guitars--John Cipollina and Gary Duncan, we salute you.

FALSE,B-,OK Computer,Radiohead,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2857,"
My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been Wish You Were Here, and you know why? It has soul, that's why--it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero but as long as he's Roger's that doesn't matter. Radiohead wouldn't know a tragic hero if they were cramming for their A levels, and their idea of soul is Bono, who they imitate further at the risk of looking even more ridiculous than they already do. So instead they pickle Thom Yorke's vocals in enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month. Their art-rock has much better sound effects than the Floyd snoozefest Dark Side of the Moon. But it's less sweeping and just as arid.

A miraculously homogeneous album--except for the breakthrough sax refrain on ""Baker Street,"" neither voice nor instrument ruffles the flow of hard-won axioms and sensible hooks. Very nice, I mean it--if yin and yang is your meat, this beats Percy Faith by a mile. But Fleetwood Mac it ain't.

If on 1986's Nine Lives, the first bummer of a three-decade career divided by a cleaning-up period, she was a cynic at the end of her rope, on the second she's a self-remade woman calling the shots. As usual, the few songs she wrote herself outstrip the others. But even those are for roots-rock matures who share her worldview so narrowly that not a note or emotion takes her anywhere she doesn't know like her own night table. The exceptions are a single helping of Malian guitar from Habib Koite and, to an extent, a gospel rouser by Zimbabwean crossover darling Oliver Mtukudzi. More such tracks might have forced a stretch. Instead she starts off by warning the young against ""dealing on the street."" Somehow I don't think this is gonna win any war on drugs--or get her on TRL.

You can hear Felix trying to get back as side one begins--he sings ""Feel good to be alive"" as if the phrase had just occurred to him. On ""Saga of New York"" he goes into high gear--catchy, funny, sexy, simple-minded--and he holds his own against ""Be on the Real Side."" But as Buzzy Feiten starts tricking up his own ""Jungle Walk,"" you wonder whether jungles are coy. And then you realize that there's a pink horse on the cover for a reason.

The Nostalgia Squad loves these guys--supposedly, they reincarnate the halcyon days of the pre-psychedelic mid-'60s, when rock was simple, happy music sung by harmonizing foursomes in mod clothes. Only thing is, that music used to keep us humming all day, and after listening to this for a month all I remember is three songs: ""Let's Pretend,"" ""I Wanna Be With You,"" and a remarkable Beach Boys takeoff that has tape decks in it.

""Starry Eyes"" is a great single, but it's all hook, and hooks like that don't grow on albums. Which is why only two of the songs that fill in the blanks, ""Teenarama"" and ""Insomnia,"" transcend pop professionalism.

Like so many unpretentious and unheard-of string/bluegrass/jug amalgams, this one offers a pleasant but rather slight variation on a familiar musical question, to wit: ""Do I really want to hear another version of `Golden Vanity' just because this time the mate is a she?"" They also do Bessie Smith, which is a mistake, and a shape-note hymn, which isn't. Noteworthy for uncovering an antifeminist mountain song from the '20s and for reviving the joyful, rather zany emancipation celebration, ""Kingdom Coming,"" which Peter Stampfel singles out as the first truly American melody.

Eight cuts from the engagement that produced In Person at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go, recorded in April 1966, twenty months before he died, and unreleased until late 1978. Only two of three new titles are attached to new songs, including an ""A Hard Day's Night"" that's apparently a warm-up for the ""Day Tripper"" on Live in Europe.

Convinced that a life is a wonderful thing to waste, the McDonald brothers devote theirs to writing better songs than Blue Cheer and the Barbarians--and rocking out harder, too! References to Gandhi, George Harrison, and Buffy Sainte-Marie establish their historical breadth, insults to their girlfriends their punk roots.

Side two is a partial recoup--however uncool devoting songs to loved ones may appear to the Autonomous Assholes of America, it makes sense when in fact your family (mother, father, namesake aunt) is dying all around you, and what's more it sounds like it makes sense. But that's no excuse for promulgating the peculiar idea that ""Songs"" make better friends than people, which misses the point of why people sing in the first place.

I've pretty much given up on Reddy. Never again will she risk arrangements that accentuate what's most idiosyncratic about her voice, probably because the pop audience would be even more threatened by such a sharp instrument (and the sharp mind that goes with it) than the rock audience. Nevertheless, hearing all her pop favorites in one place isn't as dispiriting as I'd feared. Didn't realize she'd had three hits about women who'd probably be diagnosed as clinically insane, and am pleased to report that the intro featuring Reddy's daughter has been restored to ""You and Me Against the World""--we're more in need of songs about single parents than of songs about nuclear couples.

As minstrelsy goes, this is good-hearted stuff (and as minstrelsy, it had better be). The reason it doesn't quite come off isn't that it's good-hearted, either: the band is outrageous enough, though probably not the way it thinks it is. Perhaps there's a clue in this mysterious observation from spokesperson Flea: ""Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow have great raps, but not that great music with it."" In a bassist, that's serious delusion.

How desperate rock scribes are for shows of quality by bands of any remaining commercial clout. This piece of let's-slow-it-down-a-little isn't terrible unless you're expecting thee funk, but though it was greeted with hosannas in a slow news month, it's certainly a turn or two slacker than Californication. When you're an energy band, wisdom don't make much nevermind. But melodies, harmonies, and so forth are supposed to drag some spiritual stuff along with them. It's not enough for Anthony Keidis to get all mature--he's supposed to say something interesting about maturity. And he's never had thing one to say about anything else.

Only the familiar tale of their Grammy validation renders the familiar tale of their double album that shoulda been a single mildly interesting. Once a bassist's band, now a guitarist's band, they're most of all an '80s band, their spiritual core, such as it is, is rooted in the agony and ecstasy of heroin and cocaine. At least when the bassist ruled they livened up this overworked dynamic with beats. Now they tax it with tunes, at least when they're on their game--as in the dead-end relationship song ""Desecration Smile"" and the marriage proposal ""Hard to Concentrate.""

Much return-of-good-old hoopla coming our way on this Sacramento quartet, and you can hear why--they're concise and quirkily intense in a laidback time (and place). But finally they don't do much more for Sacramento than, say, Randy Burns does for New Haven--even if they do take after the Band, to whom Ralph J. rather presumptuously compares them on the back cover, and Moby Grape.

All that's left of this great singer and songwriter is his sly intelligence, and sometimes I'm not so sure about that.

""I Believe in Love"" is a fairly hilarious send-up of the let's-get-down game Lou is playing right now. I mean, could Mitch Ryder or Ian Hunter ""believe in the Iron Cross"" one line and ""good-time music"" a couple later? (Christ, I hope they don't take this as a challenge.) But the joke doesn't quite hold up, and sometimes it gets lost altogether, at which point Reed sounds like he's imitating his worst enemy, himself.

Not as bad as it first sounds, but also not as good as they thought when they released it, or they wouldn't have, I hope. Suffused with somnolent tempos and pensive arrangements, the romantic trials and spiritual quests of struggling rock and rollers can be pretty hard to take, so why should we care about the ditto of wealthy movie producers with a record contract to fulfill and 21 individually acknowledged string players on call?

As a believer in pop structures I approve, but as a lover of rock and roll I'm beginning to suspect that the bouncy little beat--and probably the dinky little lyrics--come with the package.

FALSE,B-,Behind Closed Doors,Charlie Rich,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7634,"
I welcome the title hit not just because it's richly deserved but because it makes love and marriage seem exciting enough to break out of Nashville. But the album is a typical Music Row mediocrity. Love and marriage is Rich's natural subject at this stage of his career (life, I mean), but to limit him to it is counterproductive--part of the excitement of the bond is what happens outside its circle, and I don't mean cheating.

FALSE,B-,Rockin' and Romance,Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8285,"
It's a thin line between ooh and ick, and when he starts saying bum for ass (butt, buns, behind, backside, rear end, tush, I'll even settle for bottom) you can figure the feybirds have flitted off with another album. I like Walter Johnson myself, but Jonathan should realize that maybe Vincent van Gogh deserved to be called an asshole.

FALSE,B-,It's Time for . . .,Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8286,"
I think eternal youth is the secret of rock and roll myself. But if anybody really and truly believes that feeling ""Just About Seventeen"" is the way to achieve it, the arch nostalgia of this moderately gifted neoprimitive egomaniac should send them running for the Geritol.
"
FALSE,B-,I Live Here,Ritual Tension,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8288,"
""Here"" is the Lower East Side, and they're talking to (or yelling at) you, Ms. ""Social Climber""--or, more generally, Person Who Doesn't Live on the Lower East Side. Surprisingly, this parochial approach is good for music more intense and universal than, to choose the relevant example, the Bush Tetras' ""Too Many Creeps."" Unsurprisingly, it's also good for doomy drivel.
"
FALSE,B-,Roachford,Roachford,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6185,"
Between Brit trendies and American neocons, you'd think this strong-voiced black Free fan was the next Terence Trent. But TT gets over on formal spark and a sense of manifest destiny. Absent both, quality here is a function of the songwriting, which while it hits the occasional phrase isn't any more revealing in its clarity than TT's in its opacity.
"
FALSE,B-,Big Time,Smokey Robinson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11836,"
Smokey has a right to the romanticism that has saturated his solo career--deepening ick with vocal dimension has always been his metier--but I can't get behind it. So, admiration aside, I actually like this candidly discoid soundtrack throwaway more than I do A Quiet Storm, Smokey's Family Robinson, and so forth. But it does squander much plastic.
"
FALSE,B-,Blame It on Love and All the Great Hits,Smokey Robinson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8296,"
Not only does it follow dubious recent biz practice by baiting/larding the compilation with three previously unreleased ""hits""-by-association, it leads with them. Not only do all three follow dubious recent Smokey practice by farming out his songwriting, all three are stiffs. So this is hardly the reintroduction those who deserted him in 1968 or 1975 could use. And the corporate vice-president in him approved the whole deal.

FALSE,B-,My Zydeco Shoes Got the Zydeco Blues,Rockin' Sydney,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8302,"
All over America eccentrics match doggerel to jingle and then importune song publishers for their pot of gold. Sidney Simien commits his creations to vinyl, but with his big talk of ""Sidney's hits"" and ""Talkin' over,"" his world is no less wishful, except for one thing--he made his breakthrough. A small one, to be sure, but however you spell it ""My Toot-Toot"" shows off his sporadic lyrical flair and is already a New Orleans standard. Not that there's any compelling reason to hear the way Sidney does it, especially since he plays all the instruments himself (drums last, sounds like). His album is of value primarily as a specimen of guileless folk ambition, of a man struggling to adapt a local tradition to what he understands of the great outside.

FALSE,B-,Sol Negro,Virginia Rodrigues,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4126,"
Notes by Caetano Veloso, who's clearly stunned at the ability of the daughter of a street vendor to evoke ""operas, masses, lieder, and spirituals,"" a response shared by many Lusophiles and every fan of the Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir who's in on the story. The rest of us will be stupefied that such a ""celestial"" voice can exist at all. She never stretches her rich, Ella-like highs into a scat--though the few midtempo numbers have a nice jazzy lilt (dig that berimbau), her instincts are exceedingly solemn. Veloso is Veloso, which means he ""transcends the distinction between erudite and popular"" far more vividly than he thinks Rodrigues does. High middlebrows Djavan and Milton Nascimento don't, and their cameos give the game away.

If you don't like the Stones, this might serve as a sampler--the only dubious cut is the live ""Midnight Rambler."" But if you don't like the Stones, why are you reading this book? Look, here's how it works. Except for Satanic Majesties, which isn't represented here, all of their '60s studio albums are musts. Couldn't even tell you where to start. Now!, maybe. Or Let It Bleed. Aftermath? Beggars Banquet?

FALSE,B-,"""Still Life"" (American Tour 1981)",The Rolling Stones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8305,"
They sound very professional, they also sound big and rough and raunchy, and with Charlie driving and Keith making dirty noises they transform ""Let Me Go"" from an emotional vacuum to a ready-made classic. But ""Twenty Flight Rock"" has been done better by Robert Gordon (also Eddie Cochran) and the two Motown covers are disgraceful, primarily because of Mick, who has progressed from aging self-parody to old rou�""Satisfaction"" sounded more worldly-wise in 1965 (also fresher), and the same goes for every other remake here.
"
FALSE,B-,Steel Wheels,The Rolling Stones,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3844,"
All rancor and bad vibes, Dirty Work was the Stones; all impartiality and bad boys grown up, the reunion is an amazing simulation. Charlie's groove enlivens--and IDs--the mature sentiments while gibes at ""conscience"" and ""reason"" hint obliquely at self-awareness. But for Mick, self-awareness means above all accepting one's status as a pop star. Maybe he thinks ""So get off the fence/It's creasing your butt"" saves ""Mixed Emotions"" from its own conventionality. Probably he thinks giving Keith two vocals is democracy and roots. Certainly he thinks he needs the money. Wrong, wrong, and wrong again.

FALSE,B-,Holding Out My Love to You,Max Romeo,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8308,"
You get a reggae pro who's always shown good pop sense, you get producer Keith Richards doubling on gittar, you get Sly &amp; Robbie &amp;c., and what do you get? You get the Kingston equivalent of an ordinary Philly International album, which is better than ordinary Motown, not as good as ordinary Stax.

FALSE,B-,Linda Ronstadt,Linda Ronstadt,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7663,"
In which she makes a silk purse out of Silk Purse, not such a great idea--smoother, better crafted, more beautiful, and decidedly less interesting. Hardcore country songs are down to three, and here's the giveaway: four entries from the Sensitivity Squad (Jackson Browne, Livingston Taylor, and the Erics Kaz and Andersen).
"
FALSE,B-,Different Drum,Linda Ronstadt,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7665,"
With any suggestion that she can rock expunged from this compilation, we get five (out of ten) cuts by the Stone Poneys, the two good ones composed by none other than Michael Nesmith and the worst by Tim Buckley, who inspires her to imitate Joan Baez imitating (if that's necessary) a snooty spinster. We also get Jackson Browne and Livingston Taylor. Hey, maybe she can't rock.
"
FALSE,B-,Hasten Down the Wind,Linda Ronstadt,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7667,"
Linda's always wanted to be a Real Country Singer, but RCS put out two or three LPs like this every year. You know--find some good tunes, round up the gang, and apply formula. Like the great RCS she can be, she comes up with some inspired interpretations: the flair of ""That'll Be the Day"" and ""Crazy"" do justice to the originals, and her version of the title song almost makes you forget its unfortunate title. But you cover Tracy Nelson's ""Down So Low"" at your peril even if you believe not one in ten of your fans remembers it, and the three Karla Bonoff lyrics make her (I mean Karla, but Linda too) sound like such a born loser that I never want to hear anyone sing them again.
"
FALSE,B-,Mad Love,Linda Ronstadt,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12008,"
I had hopes for this album--Linda's always been underrated as a rocker--but it falls way over on the strident side of powerful. The songs could be sharper, although except for ""Justine"" those from Richard Perry's prefab Cretones are more than adequate, but the real problem is the basic fallacy of L.A. punk--Linda doesn't understand that the idea is to use a sledgehammer deftly. This is how Ethel Merman would do Elvis Costello, only Ethel Merman has a better sense of humor. And though the other covers sound pretty good, only ""I Can't Let Go"" fits in conceptually, and I'd rather hear them from Little Anthony or Young Neil or Ye Olde Hollies.
"
FALSE,B-,Diana Ross,Diana Ross,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7679,"
This is a generally catchy album by the sad standards she's settled for, but beyond Ashford &amp; Simpson's gorgeous, mournful ""Ain't Nothin' but a Maybe"" and the seven intoxicating minutes of ""Love Hangover"" it's often catchy-annoying rather than catchy-compelling or at least catchy-fun. Major offenders: ""Theme From Mahogany,"" the boop-nostalgia ""Smile,"" and its clone, ""Kiss Me Now,"" which captures her at her archest. (Catalogue number: M6-861.)
"
FALSE,B-,An Evening With Diana Ross,Diana Ross,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11763,"
The band could be Doc Severinsen's and the rushed tempo medleys are maddening, but the vivacity in this live double-LP is palpable. I haven't gotten such a good idea of what the fuss is about since Lady Sings the Blues.
"
FALSE,B-,"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere",Rossington Collins Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8314,"
Not a rerun. Skynyrd without Ronnie Van Zant isn't Skynyrd, so four survivors regroup under a more accurate name, and even more impressive, honor Van Zant's irreplaceability absolutely--by installing a woman up front. In the happy ending, the woman's singing and writing would be as singular as Van Zant's, but this is real life and real death, and instead Dale Krantz is merely strong and competent in a generalized ""rock"" way--here boogie, there almost art-metal. It's a surprise and a pleasure to hear her timbre on top of those guitars. But only the over-the-top cheating song ""Three Times as Bad"" rises out of the sound.
"
FALSE,B-,At His Best,David Ruffin,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7686,"
Although some blame Ruffin's very intermittent post-Tempts success on deliberate corporate neglect, I've never found even his biggest solo hits all that undeniable--ungrouped, his voice seems overly tense whether it's grinding out grit or reaching for highs. Corporate decay is another matter. The four Tempts songs on this compilation aren't necessary--Ruffin has managed to chart ten songs in the nine years he's been on his own--but they certainly show up the more recent compositions. Seems apt that the best non-Tempts cut was written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, the Berry Gordy/Holland-Dozier-Holland of the '70s.
"
FALSE,B-,Masterjam,Rufus & Chaka,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7692,"
Relieving me of ugly suspicions that the secret of Off the Wall wasn't Michael Jackson but producer Quincy Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton, the same pair pitches in here with much slighter results. In fact, they'd get exactly the kind of demi-jazz you'd expect Quincy Jones to substitute for funk. After all, the band has aspired to demi-jazz for years. Now what I want to know is whether the singer aspires to Flora Purim--the signs are mixed, but her sliding rhythms make me fear the worst.
"

If it's true they wanna be the Band, then what's with the Donald Fagen imitations? (Bob Andrews sings!) And who's doing Walter Becker? (My guess: Brinsley Schwarz.) Expert, quirky, and arresting at first. Then expert and quirky. And do I have to tell you what comes next?

I'm supposed to complain that for all his wizardry he's not a star yet, but just you wait, he can't miss, the Mozart of his generation, that last a direct quote from a fan who collared me at a concert once. Bushwa. His productivity is a pleasure, but it always makes for mess. Examine the enclosed fifty-odd minutes and you'll find a minor songwriter with major woman problems who's good with the board and isn't saved by his sense of humor.
"
FALSE,B-,Rush Hour,Bobby Rush,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7699,"
A lot of this is fun--I'm delighted to find Leon Huff collaborating with someone who's got funk in his soul, and heartened to hear a protest song about the problem of lost keys. But a lot of it--the witless ""Evil Is,"" the characterless ""Hey, Western Union Man""--is dumber than Kenny Gamble.
"
FALSE,B-,Tom Rush,Tom Rush,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7701,"
Rush was a prophet in the days of folkies rampant, working with Al Kooper and Roosevelt Gook on a side of Chess-style rock and roll in 1966 and beating the crowd to J. Mitchell, J. Taylor, and J. Browne in 1968. Nor was he limited to good ideas--his rich, clear, lithe voice broke into raunch so naturally that his up-and-bluesy ""Something in the Way She Moves"" cut all subsequent versions. But now that his brainstorms have become world currency he seems stuck in the latest folkie fad, high-gloss vocal decorum. And now that everyone's discovering unsung songwriters he's forced to resort to knowns like F. Neil and J.C. Young or unknowables like M. McLaughlin (McLauchlan?) and D. Whiffen (Whitten?). This could be a rut.

FALSE,B-,Carney,Leon Russell,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2044,"
Not the radical falloff some report--just slippage, the first side listenable and the second flaky. Not that I expect ""Manhattan Island Serenade"" or ""Cajun Love Song"" to get covered like ""This Masquerade."" And not that I enjoy anything else as much as ""If the Shoe Fits,"" a cheap shot at hangers-on that says more about the performer's lot than ""Tight Rope"" and ""Magic Mirror"" put together.
"
FALSE,B-,Digital Bullet,RZA,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11012,"
Rumors of RZA's musical decline are the kneejerks of spastics. Ghost Dog got him past Bernard Herrmann, and he's produced more Wu albums in the last year and a half than in the previous eight. But as a rapper he's no less a gangsta-in-his-own-mind than Dre or Puffy. To his credit, he seems aware of this. ""Bobby Digital"" is truly a ""character,"" based on the Robert Diggs who fucks bitches and loves bling, and his reggae peacemongering, female-principle antimaterial-ism, and revolutionary rhetoric--that is, the last three tracks on his record--aren't as pro forma as most shows of redeeming social importance. Nevertheless, listening to Bobby plod through his own boasts and brutalisms could make you believe Jay-Z is a good person. Is this the bullet Ghostface's wallet is proof against? Let's hope so.
"
FALSE,B-,Stronger Than Pride,Sade,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6207,"
I'm glad this self-made aristocrat has a human side, but I prefer her image: now that she's singing billets-doux, she's even further from rewarding the concentration she warrants than she used to be. Touching your beloved with a few true cliches is hard enough. For an audience you have to come up with something that doesn't fade into the background like the new age jazz she went pop with.
"
FALSE,B-,Love Deluxe,Sade,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3072,"
I'm unable to find fault with her more memorable songs--keep falling asleep before I've finished the sentence. But I swear on a stack of Billboards that half these nine fail to qualify. That's nine, eight with words, in four years. Would you say she's honing her art to the bone? Or would you say she's a nice person with a million-dollar scam? And how come her Somalian woman ""hurts like brand-new shoes""? Is that, er, ""metaphorical distance""? Are we supposed to clap now?

FALSE,B-,Doug Sahm and Band,Doug Sahm and Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7798,"
Sahm may not be the only completely unselfconscious white rock and roller of the post-Beatles era, but I dare you to name the other one, and that's why Jerry Wexler's part of his cult. But Doug's a talent, not a genius, and a country-rock/country supersession posing as a ""band"" is only going to inhibit him. Despite (hell, including) the new Dylan song, humdrum plus.
"
FALSE,B-,Moonshot,Buffy Sainte-Marie,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7709,"
Because there's something almost perversely machinelike about her vibrato, more Yoko Ono than Judy Collins, I've never been comfortable relegating this particular folkie to the crystal teardrop brigade. Here she finally does something overtly perverse--comes out of Nashville with what sounds in its most interesting moments like an art-pop record (with politics, of course). Those who love or even respect her are dismayed. I say her next step is to take up the Moog.
"
FALSE,B-,Lagartija,Walter Salas-Humara,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6088,"
If this were really an ace songwriter doing his own thing, rather than a long-suffering semipro wondering why his group is short a label deal, he'd showcase songwriting. Instead he concentrates on riff-tunes--pretty good ones that aren't what you'd call propelled by the auteur's overdubbed guitar and drums. Which must mean he's saving the ace stuff for the Silos. Good.
"
FALSE,B-,Caravanserai,Santana,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7715,"
Some of the slower electronic stuff fails to sustain my admittedly tentative interest, and the Gillette commercial vocals take  this post-hippie business altogether too far. Still, I'm happy to report that the experiment--away from Latino schlock and toward Mahavishnu you can dance to, sort of--is not only honest but successful and not only successful but appropriate. After all, improvisation has always been their ""thing.""
"
FALSE,B-,Santana's Greatest Hits,Santana,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7717,"
The problem with their albums turns out to be too complex to be solved by eliminating uninteresting tunes--which is a backhanded compliment to the complexity of their concept. In any case, this compilation reduces their music to a cross between pan-African blooze and Latin-metal pop. The fine (and, er, not so fine) cuts it showcases work better in their original contexts--as heads, lynchpins, focal points of improvisations that are not (yet?) what they should be.

On the back cover is a photograph of three men. Two of them are dressed in white and have their hands folded--one grinning like Alfred E. Neuman, the other looking like he's about to have a Supreme Court case named after him: solemn, his wrists ready for the cuffs. In between, a man in an orange ski jacket and red pants with one white sock seems to have caught his tongue on his lower lip. He looks like the yoga coach at a fashionable lunatic asylum. Guess which one is Sri Chinmoy.
"
FALSE,B-,Silver Dreams Golden Reality,Devadip Carlos Santana,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7725,"
Frustrating, especially for an earthbound churl like myself--spiritual program music that mixes genuinely celestial rock with the usual goop. The ""title"" song (which for some arcane reason--scansion, probably--substitutes the word ""Smiles"" for ""Reality"")  is an altogether revolting string-fed banality. It's followed by an instrumental on which the guitarist attains his soaring apogee, and a Sri Chinmoy (!) tune--arranged by Narada Michael Walden (!!)--that achieves a natural impressionism Eno (!!!) couldn't hope for. See what I mean?

FALSE,B-,The Best of Savoy Brown,Savoy Brown,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7729,"
More even than John Mayall, this band was the great mean--that is, the mean--of the purist (as opposed to heavy) wing of what we in America once called British blues, and these eight tracks, none recorded after 1972, say it all. ""Train to Nowhere"" is a minor classic, ""A Hard Way to Go"" and maybe one or two others mildly memorable, and that's it for twelve albums. I mean, who wants to hear (third but not last vocalist) Dave Walker sing ""Wang Dang Doodle"" when it's on The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions? And who but an annotator would describe an empty-headed Kim Simmonds guitar solo (over a rhythm section that's simultaneously stolid and shaky) as ""piercing and blistering""?
"
FALSE,B-,Silverbird,Leo Sayer,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7730,"
The musical tricks repeat themselves, but they're good--the sharp, punky growl that accedes so naturally to the vulnerable falsetto, the punch of the drums against the depth of the strings. But the words fail me. Sayer makes much of his mask--a mask so enigmatic that it registers, at best, as a blank. Why then should I wonder what's behind it?
"
FALSE,B-,Another Year,Leo Sayer,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7732,"
Leo sounds so much like Elton this time that I thought I'd finally figured him out, for like Numero Uno he seems very aware that people buy hooks, not words, belting/crooning every lyric with the same synthetic intensity regardless of its worth. The switch to a social realist tack here would then be explained by the presence of new songwriting collaborator Frank Farrell. My problem: Sayer writes the words, Farrell the melodies. Sayer's problem: we love Elton for his megalomania, and megalomania is something you have to earn.

A decade ago now, Boz joined a struggle--the struggle to prove a white man could sing not merely the blues, but their pop equivalent. Between his hippie pipes and his tendency to take things easy, it was hard, but determination shone through his most laid-back music--he stood out partly because few white guys were trying anything so contemporary, and partly because he had to go that extra inch lyrically to make his point. Since Silk Degrees, however, his only struggle has been to stay on top of the new white pop hegemony he helped create. Though he writes better material than Michael McDonald, the difference isn't degree, just taste. And though he's learned a lot about singing--maybe too much--McDonald has better pipes.

Anybody as smart as Schoolly, who on his own testimony turned down a scholarship from Georgia Tech because he only wanted to study art, must be held responsible for his own bullshit, especially if he makes a large part of his living selling black fantasy to white thrill-seekers. Are B-boys really like this? How the fuck am I supposed to know? What I do know is that between his cheeba and his malt liquor and his foldaway dick and his casual ""faggot""s and his eagerness to blame an unspecified cocaine habit on a nameless and maybe even figurative ""white bitch,"" he's the white audience's paranoid-to-masochistic fantasy of a B-boy. He deserves credit for realizing the fantasy so scarily, and for commanding his own tough-guy sound. But that doesn't mean you have to like him.

In which he redeems the overexpressionistic ""River Deep, Mountain High"" (on Mongrel) with a funny version of ""Nutbush City Limits"" (a better song anyway) and writes his own ""Katmandu"" (roll over, Cat Stevens). And beyond that there's the title tune, which seems overunsarcastic to me.

This isn't just an honest, rough-and-ready craftsman reverting to form, because he's trying to repeat an inspired, uncharacteristically precise success. So he sounds phony at times, desperate to inject drama into run-of-the-mill material that might work in a more fluid, less fraught-with-meaning live setting. Exception: ""Feel Like a Number,"" in which the banal critique of quantification is renewed by Seger's measured intensity.

It's not their indifferent singing and rapping, which are only to be expected. It's that they have no class and no sense of humor; they're too smarmy and too slow; they're big phonies. They epitomize the difference between seduction and betrayal--between shared lie and imposed illusion, rascal and bounder, rogue and complete asshole. There's not a winning wink on the entire album. And only ""Waiting for the Day"" (""When you can spend the night"") offers up a fantasy with any educational potential for the fine females who lap up their shit.

FALSE,B-,Friends,Shalamar,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8353,"
Their first album since WEA started distributing Solar is also their first album since the one they wrote themselves failed to go top one-hundred. And it's also safe and sorry: Leon Sylvers and cohorts in complete control. Sure they'll score their ghettoized best-sellers, maybe even sell their allotted five hundred thou. But there'll be no reason to cry foul when that's all they do.

FALSE,B-,Shango Funk Theology,Shango,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8358,"
With its positive party line, international beats, ensemble vocals, and tributes to P-Funk, Sun Ra, and Sly, this may well be the first rap album that fully expresses the ideals and ideas of the group with its name on the cover--or at least of its esteemed leader, who happens to be Afrika Bambaataa. But because not one member of the ensemble (or all of them together) qualifies as any kind of grandmaster, and because Material's best rap track is still by Tribe II, the cuts that open each side (functionally enough, too) never even broke through as twelve-inches. And whatever they express, ""Thank You"" and ""Let's Party Down"" are filler.

FALSE,B-,Do You Wanna Get Away,Shannon,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8360,"
Her pleasantly expressive voice free of inconvenient conviction, she slips unassumingly from stance to stance--fantasy lover to wronged Cosmo Girl to horny wildcat to committed lifemate. Thus she never gets in the way of true stars Chris Barbosa and Mark Liggett, whose production is consistently engaging but less peaky than back when they were earning the right to develop their property.

FALSE,B-,Street Light Shine,The Shirts,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7773,"
This is awful only on the big side-closers, and the occasional klutziness of the lyrics is redeemed not only by a winning sincerity but by improved (sometimes pretty) singing and composition--try ""Starts With a Handshake"" or ""Love Is a Fiction."" I might even want to play the end-of-the-world song for Chris Stein. Sincerity can be infectious.
"
FALSE,B-,No Borders Here,Jane Siberry,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8364,"
""Canada's most critically acclaimed new artist"" says the sticker, but you know Canadians--they lose their heads when a native evinces the merest soupcon of originality. She's even been compared to Laurie Anderson, I guess because she's abstract sometimes. I'll say. How thoroughly she's transcended what I'm sure was a careful upbringing is summed up in a statement of aesthetic principle that I swear is unsullied by the tiniest smudge of irony: ""Symmetry is the way things have to be.""
"
FALSE,B-,When I Was a Boy,Jane Siberry,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1659,"
Interesting music is the perfect cover for mediocre literature. Many serious pop fans, especially genteel ones, are so hungry for tokens of intelligence that they'll cut slack for anyone who transcends the quatrain, pondering sung imagery they wouldn't glance at in a slim volume. If you skip ""Sweet Incarnadine"" (""edited down from a 20 min. improvisation,"" God help us), this isn't altogether horrible. Siberry has a sense of shape and texture; there are clever glints of informality in her presentation; her passion shows more smarts and decency than most. But her settings are only settings. And her words are only intelligent.

FALSE,B-,Silver Convention,Silver Convention,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3158,"
I hedged last time for fear this group would turn into an annoyance if they got big, but they didn't. Instead they persist as an odd classic, instantly identifiable within a notoriously homogeneous genre, replacing soft disco's characteristic baby-oil flow with an endearingly square herky-jerk. Unfortunately, this collection necessitates a more serious hedge, on grounds of material (""songs"" seems to arty a term). They should have borrowed ""Lady Bump"" and ""Big Bad Boy"" from Penny McLean, whose bland vocalizing is best buried in the mix, as it is here, rather than showcased on a ""solo"" album.

This advocate of the fuck-around-and-fib-about-it school of post-monogamy (""Morality is what I can do and still live with myself,"" she revealed to her publicist recently) dedicates her latest to Ana������������������s Nin, and for once I think she's selling herself short--at her best she's sharper than Ana������������������s Nin.

FALSE,B-,One Trick Pony,Paul Simon,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8367,"
The soundtrack to a going-nowhere flick about an over-the-hill rocker that he scripted, starred in, and of course scored is also his first true album in five years, and while it's literate, tasteful, etc., it's also--self-evidently--the work of a man who thinks he's too big for music (at five-foot-two, gosh). So if individual songs don't stand out the way they have ever since ""The Sound of Silence,"" maybe he doesn't work as hard at them anymore. Like so many aging folkies he's devolved into a vaguely jazzy pop, and except for the lead cut and the one with Ray Charles on it everything serves the excuse for a groove.
"
FALSE,B-,Baltimore,Nina Simone,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7791,"
Carried along on David Matthews's uncharacteristically infectious arrangement, Simone's version of one of Randy Newman's more perfunctory American-names songs is a glorious fluke on the order of Baez's ""Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."" I'm glad, though, that it's available as a single, because unlike owner-annotator Creed Taylor I don't find that Simone's ""magnificent intensity . . . turns everything--even the most simple, mundane phrase or lyric--into a radiant, poetic message."" On the contrary, her penchant for the mundane renders her intensity as bogus as her mannered melismas and pronunciation (move over, Inspector Clouseau) and the rote flatting of her vocal improvisations. There are several good cuts here; the song selection is often inspired (Hurley-Witkins's ""The Family,"" perfect). But a woman who not only avoids coming out with the ""bitch"" in ""Rich Girl"" but hobbles the rhythm as well has real problems.

FALSE,B-,The Sound of Sunbathing,The Sinceros,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7793,"
Wayne Robins clued me in on why I wasn't connecting with these sly, solid, snappy songs when he told me they reminded him of Freddie and the Dreamers. Right--it's Freddie evolved from teen lies to pop candor, effetely nasty rather than revoltingly cute, acknowledging his own little failings and hostilities in a mildly remorseless voice. And sly, solid, and snappy for all that.

""Let's [garbled] it seriously, man, get all the notes right,"" Doug orders his platoon before they attack an obscure Hayes-Porter song, and you can hear them trying--throughout the album, the effort gets in the way. Except for the classic ""Be Real,"" the most striking groove is struck by guests Wayne Talbert and Martin Fierro, who impersonate McCoy and 'Trane on the coda to ""Don't Bug Me!""

FALSE,B-,Skyyline,Skyy,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8384,"
Catchy and functional, but the funny voices don't know any jokes and the lady who sings the hit is about to fuck her girlfriend over. In short beyond the reggae and the kazoos it's neither adventurous nor ingratiating--just catchy and functional.

""No no no,"" an A&amp;R man to remain nameless exclaimed to Steve Washington last year. ""Not funk. Funk's not the future. It's disco, disco."" Whereupon Washington, unaware that by the time his album appeared the same a&amp;r man would either have declared disco dead or been declared dead himself, bought some string programs, taught the boys to sing those backups high, and made room for Starleana Young. Sure there's still a fair amount of thump and wah-wah-wah. But with Starleana singing over their shoulders, they're embarrassed to get too dirty about it.

The slower tempos will please their target audience and diminish their joke appeal for outsiders. The lyric sheet will please their target audience and make outsiders laugh at them.

The rhythms and vocals may not be compelling, but they're certainly unpredictable. The words aren't great, but they play the margins of black music's romantic-spiritual themes with some finesse. Anyone else and we'd be waiting until he fulfilled his potential. But he already has.

FALSE,B-,Let's Go All the Way,Sly Fox,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8391,"
From thumping stop-and-go bottom to gleeful Beatle allusions, the title track is the most far-out piece of music to break pop all year, and you keep waiting for the rest to go . . . somewhere, if not all the way. I'm not saying the filler isn't as meaningful as Bootsy gone romantic or Levi's gone doowop. But it sure doesn't convey the same sense of adventure.

FALSE,B-,Children of Tomorrow,Frankie Smith,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8392,"
""Double Dutch Bus"" having mixed Wolfman Jack, ghetto pig Latin, kiddie chorus, and a critique of Philadelphia's municipal transportation system into a long overdue great-grandchild of Shirley Ellis's ""The Name Game,"" the title announces Smith's reluctance to jump rope for an entire album. But the recurring little synthesizer part makes you doubt his strength of purpose, and the title tune makes you regret it. Despite a welcome slizang lesson and other modest diversions, buy the twelve-inch.

FALSE,B-,Five Ways of Disappearing,Kendra Smith,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5927,"
With the pump organ and all she does have Her Own Sound, especially if you don't remember Nico too clearly--and unlike Nico, she also has a sense of humor. But antiurban survivalists rarely like people much. And quiet as it's kept, agape is a richer musical wellspring than nonconformity.
"
FALSE,B-,Especially for You,The Smithereens,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8394,"
All pop propaganda to the contrary, Pat DiNizio's no surefire songwriter--he's only moderately hooky, and even the lyrics he hits encapsulates romantic situations you already know the ins and outs of. Takes some singer to score consistently with such songs, and no pop propagandists are palming off that lie.
"
FALSE,B-,The Smiths,The Smiths,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8395,"
Morrissey's slightly skewed relationship to time and pitch codes his faint melodies at least as much as Johnny Marr's much-heralded real guitar. What's turned him into an instant cult hero, though, is his slightly unskewed relationship to transitory sex--the boy really seems to take it hard. If you'll pardon my long memory, it's the James Taylor effect all over again--hypersensitivity seen as a spiritual achievement rather than an affliction by young would-be idealists who have had it to here with the cold cruel world.
"
FALSE,B-,Never Enough,Patty Smyth,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8400,"
I'm probably overrating this record a little. Certainly there are times when its big, every-hair-in-place production makes the big, barely controllable emotions she's going for sound hopelessly false, and from rejected partner Billy Steinberg to new producer Rick Chertoff, the songcraft is manufactured Springsteen. Yet something just slightly bruised in Smyth's big voice recalls the pop axiom that manufacture and integrity aren't mutually exclusive. Kind of like with Katrina Leskanich, only not so's you'd play the album on your own free will. And most would say I overrate Katrina Leskanich.

This specially priced 33-rpm 12-incher contains six songs and three fragments totaling 19 minutes, but it's not an album, exactly. Might be if mastermind Chris Stamey (Alex Chilton vet whose group is now called the dB's) would add the best songs from his various seven-inchers (including the six-song 33-rpm one) my faves are ""The Summer Sun"" and ""If and When"". On the other hand, ""What I Dig"" and ""Decline and Fall,"" which lead off the two sides here, would make a terrific single. Sprung harmony fans, Big Star cultists and other '60s revisionists can make further inquiries.

Snoopy's evolution into an E! cartoon is one of those regrettable trajectories of public taste that tricks get carried away by and hos ride for all they're worth. It's not just, as Tom Breihan observed in Pitchfork, that musically he runs a production line like Tom Petty or Alan Jackson. It's that he trivializes his own content--not the gangsta, braggadocio no one takes seriously anymore, but the pimp slime. People--there are no cute pimps. It's a contradiction in terms. Hustle &amp; Flow I buy. But that's not Calvin Broadus' movie. His movie is a Dreamgirls where Jamie Foxx wins. So for Rolling Stone to give this four stars with long lean Barack Obama all over its cover represents a rather sickening cultural disconnect. The one great song here isn't the cyberporn hit job ""Sexual Eruption"" or the Prince copyright that Morris Day still owns, but the demented Johnny Cash tribute ""My Medicine,"" not least for this Inspirational Verse: ""Girl my love's gonna last just as long as I'm high/You can trust every word I tell you is a lie.""
"
FALSE,B-,Outliine,Gino Soccio,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7815,"
The record of the year on the disco circuit earns its title by rejecting the washes of strings and brass outsiders associate with the form for a consciously minimalist exploration of mechanical dance rhythm, devoid of even the appearance of melody or meaningfulness. This is great in theory, and maybe on the circuit; but it comes out of my speakers dry and cold.

Marc Almond's compassionately bitchy expos������������������s of bedsitter hedonism and suburban futility risk bathos when they eschew burlesque. I'm sure his f""It's a Mugs Game,"" in which Marc pukes on his shoes, more edifying than the mock?-tragic ""Baby Doll"" or a bedhopper's lament like ""Numbers."" And David Ball's synthesized Hendrix on the bonus twelve-inch isn't funny enough to compensate.

FALSE,B-,Six,Soft Machine,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7817,"
Karl Jenkins, whose horns and keyboards replace Elton Dean's alto, provides the band's best track since ""Moon in June"": ""The Soft Weed Factor,"" in which a tiny piano riff builds through dozens (hundreds?) of repetitions into a rocking and roiling modular extravaganza. But with Robert Wyatt gone for two albums now, most of the rest is jazz or no discernible inspiration. Mike Ratledge sounds thinner every time out--I kept wondering if I'd blown a channel. Maybe he's taking a cue from Jenkins, who makes Dean sound like Gato Barbieri when he picks up his soprano.

OK, OK, I admit it. This is a credible metal album, and not because it leads with the credible ""Rusty Cage."" You can tell from the guitar noise, the main if not only point of contact between metal albums and what most of us want from rock and roll. While Chris Cornell howls on about ""lookin for the paradigm"" and ""your Jesus Christ pose"" (I swear, that's the good stuff), Kim Thayil finishes off ""Slaves and Bulldozers"" with an electrical storm and erects so much razor wire around ""Jesus Christ Pose"" (right, same song) you might almost want to interview him.

For Jon Spencer to make fun not of old black bluesmen but of the white hippies who emulated them so crudely just makes him an asshole coming and going. Given his cultural-chronological advantages, what right does he have to dog, oh, Bob Hite, who did scour the South for lost artists and recordings as well as conceiving Canned Heat, a pretty decent band in the end, even if they were less heply dissonant than Jon's? And do you really believe he doesn't relish the excuse to play-act a racist stereotype that increases his stupid sex appeal? Irony--an excuse for anything and a reason for nothing.

A renowned show group whose supersmooth producer inhibits improvisation would seem like a good bet for a live double. But this one opens with ""Fascinating Rhythm"" and includes impressions of the Supremes, Tom Jones, and Louis Armstrong. It divides the pre-climactic ""Love Don't Love Nobody"" between two sides and mixes the horns and strings so high you long for supersmoothing. And it doesn't let you see their feet during ""Mighty Love.""

The physical pleasure--not quite luxurious, but much more than comfortable--of hearing these five men join their voices in song is undiminished, and the complete, seven-minute ""Rubberband Man"" is Phil (sp?) at his most expansive.

In a way, Al Staehely's earthy rock and roll is a relief from the California spaces of what were supposedly this band's great days--songs as hard as his fast ones aren't easy to come by these days.

Released as It's All About in England in 1968, before anybody had figured out how to really exploit all these iron zeppelins and lead butterflies, this offers Beatles harmonies, a roundabout song that preceded Yes's, and a straight remake of ""The Weight"" in addition to the hilariously melosoulful John D.

Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff have bestowed upon Dusty--who as a singer of contemporary pop has only one peer, Dionne Warwick--the same cool-soul formula that's worked so successfully for Jerry Butler, but here it's wearing thin. The songs (every one written in part by Gamble) echo each other melodically and rhythmically, the instrumentation never varies, and neither does the vocal mood. If only Dusty could bring all her moods together--starting with her harder-driving stuff and working through the title cut here--she'd make a greater album than Dusty in Memphis. But that's a lot to ask.

If the title cut on this live charity record invests Dylan's protest with an aura of sacred majesty, the other three invest honorable Springsteen copyrights with an aura of sacred cow. Supposedly, his ""reinterpretations"" of his own ""classics""--acoustic ""Born To Run,"" E Street ""Tougher Than the Rest""--have a demythologizing effect, but years of enormous rooms have finally taken their spiritual toll; the self-importance he's always accused of drips from his all-American drawl like Vitalis off a D.A. He's staved off this fate for as long as he has with modest strokes like Nebraska, and it's conceivable he'll come up with another one. Then again, this was probably supposed to be another one.

The most noticeable of Difford &amp; Tilbrook Mark II's three LPs is a case study in pop-star devolution, suffused with the regrets of successful young professionals who drink too much liquor, smoke too many cigarettes, and don't want to be alone any more. Their best song is about how they really don't understand Americans, most of the rest leech off love lives that comprise long successions of small failures, and where once they were storytellers, now they've withdrawn into metaphor--surprisingly murky metaphor for such detail specialists, with lots of time references.

They cut their second album live to a single mike because they don't just love old jazz--they love old jazz records, which is also why Katharine Whalen thinks the way to channel Billie Holiday and Betty Boop is to scrunch up your tonsils. However sincerely they disavow nostalgia, they're not good enough to escape it--striving for the life they hear on those records, they're neither acute enough musically nor blessed enough culturally to get closer than a clumsy imitation. Mix in a soupcon of postloungecore eleganza and you end up with a band that's damn lucky to have written a couple of dandy songs. And if they purloined that calypso novelty hit they put their name on, I hope the teeth that get extruded are their own.

This is not a Beatles album but a Ringo album--a likable curiosity. Ringo's droll sincerity was always good for a change of pace; his songs were wonderful in context. Here that context is provided by an occasional harmony (especially John's on ""I'm the Greatest"") that makes me long for much, much more. It might be different if the songs were all as good as ""Photograph,"" but without a real singer to work with, Richard Perry cannot transmute questionable material into magic.

With Walter Becker down to composer credits and very occasional bass, Donald Fagen progresses toward the intellectual cocktail rock he's sought for almost a decade--followed, of course, by a cadre of top-drawer El Lay studio hacks, the only musicians in the world smart enough to play his shit. Even the song with Aretha in it lends credence to rumors that the LP was originally entitled Countdown to Lethargy. After half a dozen hearings, the most arcane harmonies and unlikely hooks sound comforting, like one of those electromassagers that relax the muscles with a low-voltage shock. Craftsmen this obsessive don't want to rule the world--they just want to make sure it doesn't get them.

FALSE,B-,Connected,Stereo MC's,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3325,"
Rap with an international face. Techno with a human face. Disco with a postmodern face. Techno-rap disco with a pop face. Pleasant. Beatwise. So multifaceted its functionality is fungible and forgettable.

FALSE,B-,Mona Bone Jakon,Cat Stevens,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7878,"
As an admirer of ""Matthew and Son"" and ""I Love My Dog,"" two rock songs we should have heard more of in 1967, I made Cat my token singer-songwriter when this came out--the melodies were memorable, the dry intimacy of the singing had a nice post-creative-trauma feel, and I liked ""Katmandu,"" which was about the physical (rather than spiritual) geography of a religious quest. Only later did I notice ""Lady D'Arbanville"" (his girlfriend), ""Trouble"" (too much for him), and ""I Wish, I Wish"" (a map of his soul).
"
FALSE,B-,Tea for the Tillerman,Cat Stevens,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=553,"
My big problems with this record are no doubt why it's a hit: the artificially ripened singing, which goes down like a store-bought banana daiquiri, and the insufferable sexist condescension of ""Wild World.""
"
FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits,Cat Stevens,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7881,"
Stevens has more spunk and verve than any other singer-songwriter I dislike. He's unpretentious yet harmonically idiosyncratic, with nice dissonances and a rocking chunka beat. He can be charming about things that really are nice, like dawn, and a few of the many songs he has written about his own confusion have a winning je-ne-sais-quoi. Unfortunately, for such a confused person, though, most things aren't really nice, and when ""the world as it is"" isn't driving him to tears (""Peace Train"") he often lies about it.
"
FALSE,B-,Year of the Cat,Al Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7884,"
Rather than gothics or sci-fi, Stewart goes for historical novels, and as long as he shuts up about Nostradamus--who inspired last year's Past, Present and Future, you'll remember--I say good for him. Well, actually the historical note is limited this time out to one song about Lord Grenville and references to Leonardo, phantom harlequins, etc. The prevailing tone is more spy-novel. I ask you, did Eric Ambler have an ear for melody?
"
FALSE,B-,Cactus and a Rose,Gary Stewart,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8440,"
Getting treatment for writer's block, in for commercial retooling, whatever--the man in the black hat has been shuffled off to affably self-aggrandizing Memphis country/soul/rock/biz legend Chips Moman, who put him together with a couple of Allmans and a whole side of Chips Moman songs. The title tune has something to do with a New York penthouse, and what the hell this hard-drinking redneck is doing there nobody can figure out. Overdisc the country-rock is more billy and more swamp and sounds almost like old times on the only Stewart song included, the title of which encapsulates his poetic gifts: ""How Could We Come to This After That."" How indeed.
"
FALSE,B-,Brotherly Love,Gary Stewart & Dean Dillon,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8441,"
They have two good reasons to try to make buddyful music together--Gary's goin' down and Dean's comin' up--and they work at it manfully enough. But the disappointments begin with the jacket, where Gary sports a medallion (wore hippie beads in the good old days), and are symbolized by a slickly lascivious title hit that sums up the honky tonk as singles bar.
"
FALSE,B-,Smiler,Rod Stewart,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7889,"
Except for an embarrassingly unnatural ""Natural Man"" (that's right, Aretha's), the failure here is elusive, but that doesn't make it any less real--spiritual tone, energy, horns, something like that. For me, the better part of valor is to give up before the Elton John track wears out the way the Sam Cooke stuff and ""Dixie Toot"" already have.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Rod Stewart Volume II,Rod Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7893,"

"
FALSE,B-,Foot Loose and Fancy Free,Rod Stewart,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7894,"
Gosh, what a terrific idea--a concept album about a cocksure rock and roller who Cannot Love. How'd all those cliches get in there, I wonder. I mean, the first side works up a very nice groove, although it'll add nothing to Rod's reputation as a composer or a humanitarian. But side two opens with a Vanilla Fudge remake and doesn't recover till the confessional finale, itself festooned midway through with a ""Whoo!"" so pro forma you'd think Rod had run out of steam.
"
FALSE,B-,High on You,Sly Stone,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7902,"
The lyrics haven't regained their punch, and neither have the melodies--when he does try to say something, you barely notice. But the old rhythmic eccentricity, both vocal and instrumental, makes this more interesting to listen to than the run of dancey goop. Let's not give up on him yet.
"
FALSE,B-,Ten Years Too Soon,Sly Stone,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7903,"
Pieties aside, John Luongo does better with this monstrous concept--segueing ""contemporary"" instrumental stylings into Sly's (not the Family's) greatest dance tracks--than you'd expect, and the album is at least a listenable curiosity. I mean, it's funny to hear a kickdrum-syndrum break follow the familiar ""for people who only need a beat."" And ""High on You"" is actually improved. But of course, the concept failed--this got virtually no disco play. And Greatest Hits is still in catalogue.
"
FALSE,B-,Stoneground,Stoneground,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7904,"
People exercise themselves calling this a hype, but I've heard a lot worse and am happy to wish them humility and dues. Certainly the aptest use of Sal Valentino since the Beau Brummels were on Autumn (the Beau Brummels on Warners were my idea of a hype). In the best moment, Valentino's fake-dirty vocals interlock with a real dirty song called ""Stroke Stand.""
"
FALSE,B-,The Stone Roses,The Stone Roses,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3871,"
These Britindie pheenoms are overhyped for sure, so there's a temptation to blow them off. What do they do that the Byrds and the Buffalo Springfield weren't doing better in 1967? And that a hundred Amerindie bands don't do just as well now? But they aren't all press clips--they're postmodern English, filtering folk-rock romanticism through Joy Division and Jesus and Mary Chain hyperromanticism. Though they have their moments as songwriters--""Bye Bye Badman"" always stops me, and ""I Want To Be Adored"" sums them up--their music is about sound, fingers lingering over the strings and so forth. And in the end they're surprisingly ""eclectic."" Not all that good at it, but eclectic.
"
FALSE,B-,Core,Stone Temple Pilots,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5897,"
Once you learn to tell them from the Stoned Tempo Pirates, the Stolen Pesto Pinenuts, the Gray-Templed Prelates, Temple of the Dog, Pearl Jam, and Wishbone Ash, you may decide they're a halfway decent hard rock act. Unfortunately, sometime after they've set you up with their best power chords, you figure out the title is ""Sex Type Thing"" because it's attached to a rape threat. They claim this was intended as a critique, kind of like ""Naked Sunday""'s sarcastic handshake with authority. But at best that means they should reconceive their aesthetic strategy--critiquewise, irony has no teeth when the will to sexual power still powers your power chords. And if it's merely the excuse MTV fans have reason to suspect, the whole band should catch AIDS and die.
"
FALSE,B-,Built for Speed,Stray Cats,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8450,"
Though the soft, shuffling bottom makes up in volume what it lacks in angle of attack and Brian Setzer integrates quite an array of modernistic exotica into his pickin', the mild vocals just ain't rockabilly. You know how it is when white boys strive for authenticity--'57 V-8 my ass.
"
FALSE,B-,Rant n' Rave With the Stray Cats,Stray Cats,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8451,"
I love the sound of this record--it's much bigger and rawer, as if Built for Speed's prettification was just to get over. Only an ideologue would deny that these unlikely pop stars tear into rockabilly readymades with twice the gusto of any purists or authentics now recording. And Brian Setzer is the snazziest guitarist to mine the style since James Burton. But he's also a preening panderer, mythologizing his rockin' '50s with all the ignorant cynicism of a punk poser. He's no singer, no actor, no master of persona. And if he can write songs he didn't bother.
"
FALSE,B-,The Way We Were,Barbra Streisand,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7917,"
Theoretically, I am encouraged by Barbra's abandonment of Richard Perry and Contemporary Material, and in practice I love the title song, one of those beyootiful ballads that are the gift of AM programming to the reprobate rock and roller. But my big theory has always been that we like contemporary material because it is, well, contemporary, and in practice most of these performances generate a pristine, somewhat chill unreality even as they simulate warmth, maturity, all that stuff. Also, I'm not humming any of them after half a dozen plays.
"
FALSE,B-,Credit in Heaven,The Suburbs,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8457,"
A band takes a chance when they follow up an offbeat but well-received debut with a double-LP and a lyric sheet--gives strangers the chance to get to know them. My considered conclusion is that for all his presence Blaire John Chaney is rather more affected than his quota of mother wit makes altogether seemly. His arch cynicism looks gratuitous up close, as arch cynicism usually does. Talented? Mais oui. Not talented enough to fill a double album and a lyric sheet, though.
"
FALSE,B-,Life's Too Good,The Sugarcubes,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5819,"
Their sense of mischief isn't just playful--it's experimental and a little wicked. It's also so imperfectly realized that you have to infer it out from underneath their breathy swoops, willful shifts and starts, and translated lyrics--so imperfectly realized that most of their fans, critics included, barely notice it. Which means that on the level of attention they deserve (and get), they're either a cult band to the max or vaguely irritating pop exotics.
"
FALSE,B-,Floored,Sugar Ray,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5212,"
Crude for sure, without anything to say or much to say it with, they nevertheless have some punky life to them, which I say is enhanced by their blatant ska and hip hop rips. What's most depressing about them is that their success makes sense--they're the nearest thing to a fresh young rock band the market or the ""underground"" has kicked up this year. Not counting Radish, of course.
"
FALSE,B-,Make a Record,The Suicide Commandos,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7927,"
The hooks are buried even further into the mix than the vocals and the drumming, but they're there somewhere, and I must admit that every time I hear the opening chords of either side I sit up and grin. For punk junkies only.

Did you come yet? Huh? Did you come yet?
"
FALSE,B-,I Remember Yesterday,Donna Summer,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1065,"
Cut of the month is ""Love's Unkind,"" a remake of ""Then He Kissed Me"" that I prefer to the original for the way its solo saxophone opens a window in the wall of sound. But the Supremes and Dr. Buzzard (and Natalie Cole?) takeoffs are stale if not stuffy, and when Kraftwerk goes to the disco the best you can usually hope for is air conditioning.
"
FALSE,B-,"""Once Upon a Time . . .""",Donna Summer,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1066,"
Roll over Pete Townshend and tell Jerry Leiber the news--here's the first disco opera, a double-LP concept album with actual lyrics that tell an actual story printed on the inner sleeves. First two sides are uniformly strong but without real peaks, and from there it's downhill to a climax indicated by the two final titles, ""I Love You"" and ""Happily Ever After."" But you can dance to it.
"
FALSE,B-,The Sweet,The Sweet,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7944,"
In which Phil Wainman, Mike Chapman, and Nicky Chinn ask the musical question: is heavy bubblegum bazooka-rock? Their answer: only when it goes pop. So while I'm as impressed as anyone with the success of ""Little Willy,"" I want to know what happened to ""Blockbuster."" Not to mention ""Wig-Wam Bam.""
"
FALSE,B-,Desolation Boulevard,The Sweet,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3878,"
Bazooka-rock lives, even without Chapman and Chinn. In the absence of Slade (whose failure to participate on the recent LP that bears their name must be considered disquieting), these guys play second-bill steamroller to Kiss.
"
FALSE,B-,Afterbirth of the Cool,Swollen Monkeys,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8466,"
I've been a fan of the irrepressible Ralph Carney since Tin Huey, but he doesn't have a bandleader's sense of purpose. Moderately entertaining on stage with its four or five horns and almost as many clever lyrics, his polka-to-salsa ""world rhythms"" outfit comes perilously close to mess on record, where you can't see how unpretentious their highjinks are. If sidemen are gonna goof around, better they should be smart, nice sidemen. But not that much better.
"
FALSE,B-,Best of the Sylvers,The Sylvers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7946,"
They were nice enough to program this fast-side/slow-side. Now if only the fast side didn't fade from ""Boogie Fever"" and ""Hot Line"" (by Lewis &amp; Perren) to ""Cotton Candy"" (add Yarian) to ""High School Dance"" (Switch to four Sylvers) to ""Free Style"" (switch to one Sylver).
"
FALSE,B-,Living Proof,Sylvester,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7951,"
The three concert sides are what Sylvester wants--his graduation from disco into the world of Thelma Houston and the Pointer Sisters. But insofar as he succeeds artistically he does so on effort, not achievement--he simply can't generate the requisite vocal lustre so far above his speaking register. And insofar as he succeeds commercially he does so on the strength of the studio (i.e., disco) side--which succeeds pretty well artistically, too.
"
FALSE,B-,Sylvester and the Hot Band,Sylvester and the Hot Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7947,"
In which everybody's favorite black transvestite internalizes songs by Neil Young (""Southern Man""), James Taylor (""Steamroller""), and Procul Harum (guess) as well as Ray Charles (not bad, in its way) and Billie Holiday (and people complain about Diana Ross). ""Southern Man"" is almost unrecognizable in its rock-funk arrangement, which is interesting, and if you think Sweet Baby Wimp sounds funny invoking a ""churnin' urn of burnin' funk"" just imagine those words from a cartoon character who is three-fourths Tweety Bird and one-fourth--well, it is the puddy tat's name--Sylvester. Finale: a Stax-Volt ""My Country 'Tis of Thee."" Quite a curiosity.
"
FALSE,B-,Blackjack Choir,James Talley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1656,"
Populism always has a sentimental side, but here the received images take over: bluesmen singin' sad songs and everybody lovin' love songs, lasses from Georgia and broken dreams from Chicago. His voice is richer, and ""Magnolia Boy"" and ""When the Fiddler Packs His Case"" are as great as anything from the first two albums, but I hope this is a lapse.
"
FALSE,B-,Sky-High!,Tavares,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7961,"
In the tradition of the produced group, they make hit singles, not albums, and In the City was apparently a fluke. This time they've switched to Freddie Perren, whose affinity for the transcendantly awkward lyric, best represented on the Miracles' City of Angels, here produces such gems as ""The mighty power of love/It's got more force than any shove"" and ""Son you gotta give a heck/You gotta promise to give respect."" Three fine tunes, four or five drecky ones.
"
FALSE,B-,With Friends and Neighbors,Alex Taylor,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7962,"
I figure it's time I come out with it. I hate James Taylor and I don't trust any of his damn family either. But if I had to choose I think I'd take Alex--he sounds kinda bluesy, like he's in it for the money.
"
FALSE,B-,Sweet Baby James,James Taylor,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7964,"
I have solved the Taylor Perplex, which seems to revolve around whether James was a verier godsend when he was gracing Macdougal Street with the Flying Machine, discovering the Beatles on Apple, or now. My answer: none of the above. Which leaves an even more perplexing question: which god is supposed to have sent him? Not the one in Rock and Roll Heaven, that's for sure.
"
FALSE,B-,One Step Beyond,Johnnie Taylor,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7970,"
In which Taylor delivers a love sermon and works his two themes for two hits. ""Jody's Got Your Girl and Gone"" is a memorable addition to the mythology of infidelity, but ""I Am Somebody"" is at best a competent black pride riff in biracial drag--like the rest, nothing to be ashamed of rather than something to be proud of.
"
FALSE,B-,Taylored in Silk,Johnnie Taylor,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7971,"
With the aid of Wade Marcus's gloopy strings, this is where Taylor goes pop, and though he's trying for silk it sounds like the same old polyester--eight songs stretched over thirty-three minutes, including one soul-wringer hit, one blues-talking hit, and filler, much of which does have a certain reflective charm.
"
FALSE,B-,Reunion,The Temptations,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8480,"
Motown has put a lot into this event, with Berry, Smokey, and even Rick pitching in on new songs, but since most of the leads remain with Dennis Edwards, who led the Tempts into the nightclubs, it's possible to forget that David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks are back. Edwards demonstrates his professionalism by not breaking into giggles during ""I've Never Been to Me,"" but when he proclaims loyalty to the ""punk funk"" on James's entry, the best-sung George Clinton rip ever, I simply don't believe him.
"
FALSE,B-,100cc,10cc,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7990,"
It can't be easy to put together a compilation album that's less listenable than either of the two regular-issue LPs to which you have access, but displaced impresario Jonathan King, trailing kisses in the direction of ""I'm Not in Love"" (which he doesn't control) and ""Everyone's Gone to the Moon,"" does the trick here with the help of a few B sides. Secretly, I suspect, King still hopes to score a schlock smash like the two aforementioned, so instead of sticking to the uptempo burlesques that are 10cc's entree to the human race he gives a lot of their art-school slow stuff a second shot. And comes up with zilch.
"
FALSE,B-,Secrets of the I Ching,"10,000 Maniacs",1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8481,"
True enough, these new-wave art-folkies don't sound like anybody else, including their kissing cousins in R.E.M. Reason one is Robert Buck on ""principal guitars devices,"" all delightful space effects and airily elliptical hooks. But reason two is Natalie Merchant and her equally airy ""voice."" Not only does Natalie inflect the English language as if she grew up speaking some Polynesian tongue, but she writes lyrics to match, lyrics which from the crib sheet I'd adjudge the most sophomoric poetry-of-pretension to hit pop music since lysergic acid was in flower. Random stanza: ""Patrons in attendance/To disarm a common myth/Homage paid to the victor of immortality/Cloaked in bold tones."" Jesus.
"
FALSE,B-,In My Tribe,"10,000 Maniacs",1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8482,"
Natalie Merchant's nasal art-folk drawl isn't altogether intolerable, and her ""Peace Train"" cover sets up dippier expectations than her new lyrics deserve. Signalling her professionalism by deprivatizing her metaphors, she actually says something about illiteracy, today's army, and cruelty to children. In private, however, she remains a Cat Stevens fan with a nasal art-folk drawl.
"
FALSE,B-,Blind Man's Zoo,"10,000 Maniacs",1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5796,"
Natalie Merchant has her own prosaic prosody, with off-kilter guitar accentuating its eccentric undertow. The whole second side makes politics not love, and sometimes--like when the lottery-playing mom of ""Dust Bowl"" rubs her fevered youngest down with rubbing alcohol--she brings you there. But somehow I knew that when she got down to cases she'd still be a fuzzy-wuzzy. This is a woman whose song about Africa (called ""Hateful Hate,"" now there's a resonant phrase) brushes by slavery on its way to elephanticide and ends up condemning ""curiosity""--again and again. No wonder she won't listen to ""common sense firm arguments.""

FALSE,B-,Cricklewood Green,Ten Years After,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7993,"
Despite Leo Lyons's responsive bass and Ric Lee's reliable drums, it's obviously the speed and tensile tone of Alvin Lee's guitar that makes this music what it is--pure boogie, a style which benefits from impurities. As such, it's best experienced on Undead. Alvin sings pretty well, but his songwriting is barely serviceable, which puts the ordinary amenities of studio pop beyond his means.

In which the rock heavy comes of age with his toughest, fullest, and most coherent album. I like it in a way, but it does lack a certain winning abandon, and I'm not crazy about the heavy's economic theories--fellow seems to believe that if you ""tax the rich to feed the poor"" you soon run out of rich, with dire consequences.
"
FALSE,B-,I Gotcha,Joe Tex,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7997,"
Joe's rhythms have gotten a lot trickier since the days of ""Show Me"" and ""Skinny Legs,"" which is probably the real reason the title tune was such a smash--the story line isn't up to his vintage stuff even if Joe was moved to restate it for a finale. Granted, I did turn up the treble to find out what he was asking her to do in ""You Said a Bad Word"" (still don't know). But beyond that there's only--talk about common touch--""Bad Feet,"" which has nothing to do, narratively, with getting on the good one.
"
FALSE,B-,Rub Down,Joe Tex,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7998,"
Because the jokes and grooves are mostly baldies and retreads, there's an obvious alternative title: Let Down. But that's only in comparison to Bumps and Bruises, the fruit of a layoff long enough to give this glorious bullshit artist the chance to think up some really good cons.
"
FALSE,B-,Midnight Mission,The Textones,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8483,"
I've tried to work up some enthusiasm for this well-meaning, well-reviewed quintet. I've tried to hear the commitment and imagination I know it took for a woman from Texas to infuse the tiredest straight-ahead rock with politics and personality. But except for ""Clean Cut Kid""--written by the new Dylan, sounds like the old Stones--what I mostly hear is committed straight-ahead rock that's tired by formal definition.
"
FALSE,B-,Them Crooked Vultures,Them Crooked Vultures,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15177,"
In his demure way, macho formalist Josh Homme has emerged as a post-Nirvana rock auteur to rival Jack White himself. Signature project taking a break? No prob. He'll just hire the supposed musical glue of the heaviest aggregation of all time, wave his magic bushwhacker and turn Nirvana's most successful member back into the drummer we wish he'd remained, and pound out what any blindfolded stoner with girlfriend problems would yell in your face was another Queens of the Stone Age album, and later for effing Eagles of Death Metal. Homme sees the humor in his formalism even if his fans don't, and the all-star rhythm section does add fluidity. But in the end this is hard-rawk nirvana with a small ""n""--a world of unusually hot sex and skull-busting drugs young guys with girlfriend problems will wish was so. I mean, that is one hell of a market share.

Although it's possible to imagine these musicians powering a rock and roll band that means a damn thing, this cross between Frisco antiheroes the Residents and Dixie dregs Love Tractor is too avant-garde to serve up anyone's money's worth. Nothing lasts, that's the message, whether it's the dense riffage of ""2X4S"" or the orchestrated guffaws and seal barks that finish ""More Glee"" with a flourish. Lyrics? How vulgar. We should be thankful when they make with the private jokes doted on by performance artists everywhere.

The proof of how desperate people are for new Springsteen is that they'll settle for this--even ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" is the sort of thing that ends up in Bruce's wastebasket. If Irish teen traumas are as boring as Phil Lynott's descriptions of them, it's no wonder they have trouble maintaining their birthrate. And if Irish teen traumas are as secondhand as Scott Gorham's guitar lines, the Irish will probably end up preferring Springsteen too.

No longer saddled with one of the most vacant art reputations in the history of hype, this decidedly unavant unfunk trio are free to pursue the airhead pop they were born to, and first try they've scored a natural: ""Hold Me Now"" is a classic on chord changes alone, i.e., even though Tom Bailey sings it. Nothing else here approaches its heart-tugging mastery, but the album remains lightly creditable through the title-cut chinoiserie which opens side two. After that, as Alannah Currie herself puts it, who can stop the rain?
"
FALSE,B-,Bad to the Bone,George Thorogood and the Destroyers,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8499,"
Thorogood has added true boogie power to his blues, so his Diddley and Hooker no longer sound like three-quarter-size juke-joint facsimiles. And in a predictable trade-off, he's added true boogie macho to his persona, so he gets his rocks off complaining about the Mann Act.

FALSE,B-,Most Known Unknown,Three 6 Mafia,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13103,"
The pull of their gut-rumbling brew of dark keyb riffs and viscous rhythm under unison vocals isn't absolute, but it's there, distinct and original. Unfortunately for connoisseurs of the saturnine, however, it comes with rhymes that are part of the aesthetic experience. As a putative cocaine magnate, rival flava-of-the-year proprietor Young Jeezy enjoys privileges that include triumphalist fanfares, yes-man cheering sections, and a relatively abstract level of brutality. These Memphis lifers sell ""street,"" eventuating in quite a bit of put-your-foot-up-they-ass, knock-the-black-off-your-ass, ransack-your-home, and rape-your-bitch-cause-she's-stacked. It isn't original to point out that the reality this worldview represents is a bully's reality, one that most of those who are stuck with it scheme to avoid. But originality isn't everything. Bully reality can be musically compelling, no question. But jones for it and you risk brutalizing yourself.

Drums: Speedy Keen, a Cockney who writes and sings a very creaky lead. Guitar: Jimmy McCulloch, who is sixteen and looks thirteen. Piano, surname, and miscellaneous: Andy Newman, who is in his late twenties and looks in his early forties, and who didn't want to join because it meant giving up his pension at the post office.

In the great tradition of Kansas and Starcastle (and also, let's be real, Berlin and Scandal), these social climbers infuse a Brit idea of dubious truth value with a shot of marketable American vulgarity--not only do they roll out synth-pop hooks like vintage A Flock of Seagulls, but Aimee Mann's throaty warble sounds almost human. And while the generalization level of her aggressively banal lyrics signals product, not expression, every one lands square on a recognizable romantic clich�"
FALSE,B-,Future Funk/Uncut!,Alfonia Tims and His Flying Tigers,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11415,"
Tims' guitar, uncommonly lyrical in a style where chop and slash has become a convention makes the funk-here-ska-there modality-somewhere else excursions seem comfortable enough. But not only can't he sing, he can barely chant, and the dull sound that plagues ROIR tapes deadens any compensatory bass-and-drums thrust.

FALSE,B-,Tin Machine,Tin Machine,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6210,"
The hard-rock version of Let's Dance: in his corporate, iconic way, D. Bowie is sincerely trying to impress consumers. Before it's too late. Guitars range from imitation Thurston Moore to imitation Frank Marino, songs are as pissed off as a millionaire can be. But he isn't the supersponge he used to be, and as he already knew in 1983, the inescapable groove lends itself to skillful manufacture more readily than the righteous onslaught.

Obviously not stupid, which I can understand means a lot to them after their troubled childhoods, these guys are the class of the American post-rock cough cough hack hack movement ptooey ptooey. But I would direct their attention to the British band Mark-Almond, a now forgotten jamming unit that achieved real sales and a measure of hip around the time they were born. Not that I necessarily think these ""eclectic,"" consciously unspacy, all too unhurried soundscape improvisations are destined for the same degree of obscurity. Patterns of culture have changed, and in a boutique economy, this shit, like all other shit, is probably here to stay. Still, there are surer roads to posterity. Best moment: the lead bassline, lifted directly from ""Poptones"" (by PiL, kids).

FALSE,B-,Toto IV,Toto,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8515,"
Wish I could claim this millionaire Grammy-rock was totally pleasureless, but professionalism is rarely that neat. The fattest of all studio bands is almost as hooky as Shoes or the Ramones, and their production excesses at times betray verve, delight, even (though I must be mistaken) a sense of humor. But the lyrics are utterly forgettable, and the tone and spirit have nothing to do with rock and roll--unlike Thom Bell, to whom they've been rapturously compared in Billboard, they don't know the difference between slick and smooth, between hedonism and conspicuous consumption. At least Michael McDonald learned his shit from the real thing; Bobby Kimball and Steve Lukather learned theirs from McDonald. Still, for a band that crosses Chicago, Asia, and the Doobie Brothers, they have their glitzy moments.

Townshend has said the only reason this isn't a Who record is that it wasn't time for a Who record, which must be his oblique way of apologizing for not being able to sing like Roger Daltrey. On his earlier solo excursions, the casually reflective mood suited his light timbre. Here he's coming to terms with love, frustration, punk, and other subjects that overtax his capacity for urgency and anger (and understanding). Who fans find the gap between aspiration and achievement touching, even thematic. Nonbelievers find it whiny. And they hate those ostinatos.

Sandy Linzer's Chic move in the sense that Odyssey was his Dr. Buzzard move, with Thelonious Jr. playing drums and sister Boo Boo singing. But the world-historic irresistibility of the band's counterpart to the urbane ""Native New Yorker""--the c'est-si ""Bon Bon Vie,"" a rich song about aspiring to the rich life that's ebullient on top and this far from desperation underneath--inheres as much in Thelonious Jr.'s unslick, high-humored vocal and explosive percussion as in an arrangement that keeps revealing new pleasures.

Punk has not been good for former Duck Deluxe Sean T. because it's meant urbanization. I have nothing against the slick, hooky power chords his pub-rock has evolved into, not in theory.

FALSE,B-,America -- Do You Remember the Love?,James Blood Ulmer,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1632,"
One danger of putting Bill Laswell in the studio with the likes of Blood is his respect for the avant-garde. From Nona Hendryx or Motorhead or even Sly and Robbie he'll brook no bullshit, but give him a committed innovator and he can turn into a humble servant of the muse, as in his worthy, inconsequential Celluloid LPs for Daniel Ponce, Billy Bang, etc. From Sonny Sharrock he got a definitive record that way; from Blood he gets a dud. The digital neatness may be Blue Note's fault, and the schematic instrumentals typify Laswell's compulsion to contain chaos. But the thinness of the guitar itself sounds like Blood's misplaced idea of a Wes Montgomery move. And I guarantee you Laswell didn't think any of the three vocal tracks were radio fare, no matter who he hired to sing backup.

FALSE,B-,October,U2,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4060,"
As they push past twenty their ambitions are showing, and suddenly the hope-addicts whiff both commerce and pretension. Sure it's still all fresh-faced and puissant in that vaguely political way that so moves the concerned rock journalist (and fan)--just not altogether unspoiled, sniff sniff. Bono Vox gets poetic, Steve Lillywhite gets arty, and those of us who expect more than sonic essence of rock and roll get enough melody and construction to make the first side a bit of all right. What a stupid band to expect purity from.
"
FALSE,B-,Zooropa,U2,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4066,"
I've never seen the point of hating U2. Their sound was their own from the git, and for a very famous person, Bono has always seemed thoughtful and good-hearted. I liked what I read about their pop irony, too. Problem was, I couldn't hear it--after many, many tries, Achtung Baby still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, and I put it in the hall unable to describe a single song. But having processed this blatant cool move, I'm ready to wax theoretical. Achtung Baby was produced by Daniel Lanois, and Daniel Lanois isn't Brian Eno--he's Eno's pet romantic, too soft to undercut U2's grandiosity, although I admittedly enjoy a few of its anthems-in-disguise now. Zooropa, on the other hand, is half an Eno album the way Low and ""Heroes"" were. The difference is that Bowie and Eno were fresher in 1977 than Bono and Eno are today. Each must have hoped that the other's strength would patch over his own weakness--that Eno's oft-wearisome affectlessness would be mitigated by Bono's oft-wearisome expressionism and vice versa. But tics ain't strengths, and although these pomo paradoxes have their moments, when I'm feeling snippy the whole project seems a disastrously affected pastiche of relinquished principle.

Pretty impressive show-off stuff--not just Eddie's latest sound effects, but a few good jokes along with the mean ones and a rhythm section that can handle punk speed emotionally and technically. At times Eddie could even be said to play an expressive--lyrical?--role. Of course, what he's expressing is hard to say. Technocracy putting a patina on cynicism, a critic might say.

FALSE,B-,Diver Down,Van Halen,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8561,"
Less impressive, if only because hangloose covers like ""Big Bad Bill"" and ""Happy Trails"" are for more attractive bands. More attractive, if only because the Ray Davies and Roy Orbison covers are so carefully conceived. Attractive sexist original, unatttractive (hence unimpressive) sexist original, guitar as cathedral organ. And so it goes.

FALSE,B-,Suzanne Vega,Suzanne Vega,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8569,"
If I walked into a folk club and came upon this woman strumming her songs, I'd be impressed too--she picks her words with evident care and conversationalizes her chosen vocal tradition with evident savvy. But that's not good enough: great lyricists either dazzle you utterly or sneak the imagery on by, and no folk-based vocal tradition ought to require conversationalizing. Despite her considerable talent, Vega is self-consciously Artistic like so many folkies before her, which means that while a rock and roll production might power her over her affectations, more likely it just wouldn't mesh--the slightly prissy precision of these arrangements is precisely what the songs demand. As for that ersatz medieval ballad (which ain't bad, actually)--it's no anomaly.

Right off she declares for the new realism: ""Oh mom/The dreams are not so bad/It's just that there's so much to do/And I'm tired of sleeping."" About time, too--only she can't take it. She's politically alienated and not too thrilled about that abortion. She throws up her hands at the future. She's decorous, tuneful, art-directed.

If this is all that remains of the legendary 1970 engagement, I'll take my memories. The (mono) sound isn't bad for a record mastered from a Brigid Polk cassette, but that's not to say it isn't bad, and though I'm not one to cavil about out-of-tune guitars, this time I notice. Notable performance: Lou Reed's cover of the Maureen Tucker classic ""Afterhours.""

FALSE,B-,Go West,Village People,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3900,"
At first I dismissed this as market fatigue--it's hard to act like you're still discovering your formula on your fourth album in twenty-one months. With no help from a peaked-sounding Victor Willis--shouters should avoid even the appearance of laryngitis--it came off as a tuneless disco tribute to John Philip Sousa that omitted the ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" cover only because Jacques Morali doesn't control Sousa's publishing. But now I kind of enjoy it. Cruisin' was dumb, and this is an advance--a quantum leap in dumbness, without even risque puns to distract from Victor's metronomic cries. Although I have my doubts about this ""skin-diving"" stuff myself.

Vincent was never a titan--his few moments of rockabilly greatness were hyped-up distillations of slavering lust from a sensitive little guy who was just as comfortable with ""Over the Rainbow"" in his normal frame of mind. And despite what the '50s revivalists believe, this comeback is a return to form only in the formal sense--simple songs, Tex-Mex backing. Some of it's very sweet--Doug Sahm meets ""Over the Rainbow."" But even when he slavers he does so quietly.

Wainwright writes with more precision and imagination than any other singer-songwriter of the current boom, and his melodies stick with you. He sings and plays with such authority that even though this record features only voice and acoustic guitar it's powerful musically. But. The failures of the talented are always painful, and this is very strained. He's smart enough to integrate syntactical contortions into his style, and to match them vocally, but they still make you wince sometimes. And there's no emotional maturity to go with the verbal control, no sense of kindness or ease. I enjoy this record quite a bit, but I admire it more, and sometimes I don't like it at all.

Female chauvinism and a young lifetime's worth of melodies drew me to Waldman's reflections on trains, pirates, horses, show business, and of course love. Then Carola pointed out that this was the kind of woman who not only pronounces Mexico Mehico--as in ""Gringo en Mexico""--but who flings back her right arm and says ""Ole!"" as she does so. One reason I married Carola is that she's not much interested in trains, pirates, or horses. Show business and love are universals.

FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits,Jerry Jeff Walker,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8593,"
After running his best-of against his live double one-on-one, I can only conclude that this longtime folkie and frequent drunk, a native New Yorker upstate division, turned himself into the archetypal Sun Belt hippie the natural way: interacting nice and easy with the lost gonzos in his band and the refugees from reality in his cult or audience or whatever. Cult, I guess. His audience comprises the far-flung ""outlaw"" fans who made small-scale country ""hits"" of a few of his singles--only one of which, the live ""Mr. Bojangles,"" is even included here. Such interactions don't normally come through on plastic, especially in a factory-tooled genre like country music. This time, though, buy the live double.

Walker's amazing early Dylan soundalike isn't an imitation, it's a charming tribute, and the highly recommended title cut exemplifies his (by now) all but unique fusion of novelistic eye and political heart.

Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller put so much loving labor into this double-LP that it came out too tricky--the big band and the small band and the famous sidepeople and the new songs are all quite tasty, but they distract from what ought to be the business at hand. Of course, since T-Bone is singing more with his brain than his larynx these days, that may have been the idea. But I'd trade all the solos here except maybe Dizzy Gillespie's on ""Evening""--and there are lots of good ones--to hear T-Bone play guitar on every cut.

FALSE,B-,Breach,The Wallflowers,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3909,"
Don't envy Jakob Dylan his dilemma, but don't underestimate his privilege. He's no Julian Lennon, but he's also no Rufus Wainwright, and though he comes up with strong melodies, he's hardly a match for Ben Folds or Elliott Smith, both of whom frame their catchy stuff more idiosyncratically and neither of whom is terribly interesting even so. Dylan's lyrics competently explore the metaphor-laden broken-narrative mode his father invented and loosed on the world, just as his band concept does the flat-bottomed strophic folk-rock his father ditto. Nothing in his singing, his wordplay, or--a few lucky strikes aside--his tunecraft will tempt anyone who isn't stuck on his dad to parse those lyrics, to care what they mean. So he should praise the Lord for his cheekbones, which come from his mom.

FALSE,B-,Just Being Myself,Dionne Warwick,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8096,"
Even in the heyday of Bacharach-David Dionne didn't make such terrific albums--the best-ofs were the prizes. So Holland-Dozier-Holland are doing all right: solid pop, with the rhythm up front and the strings often used percussively--though they do wash out on ""I Always Get Caught in the Rain"" (inclement weather is as bad for arrangers as it is for lyricists). H ook-of-the-month: the guitar riff on ""You're Gonna Need Me.""

FALSE,B-,Mister Magic,Grover Washington Jr.,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1465,"
For the best-selling jazz album in the country, this is funktional enough. Washington plays a warm tenor in the pop jazz tradition of Gene Ammons, the rhythm section percolates danceably, and the result is sexy background music marred superficially by Bob James's strings.
"
FALSE,B-,Was (Not Was),Was (Not Was),1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4147,"
Brains galore, as both lyrics and horn charts trumpet. But if that ain't all, half the time it's too damn close--complementing the full complement of conceits is a grand total of three songs the way I count them. Which must make the omission of the rock-and-rolling ""Wheel Me Out,"" and for that matter A Christmas Record's ""Christmas Time in the Motor City,"" the kind of hubris the brainy can't resist.

FALSE,B-,Larger Than Life,Jody Watley,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6211,"
Having cornered a new-artist Grammy by narrowcasting her lust for lust, the young black-pop veteran comes up against the perils of upward mobility abuse--once you get hooked, you'll go to any length to keep rising to the top. Yet whatever she's like in ""real"" life, Jody's more credible servicing pop normals than disco nightcrawlers--demanding ""Real Love,"" hanging onto her ""L-O-V-E-R,"" dissing false ""Friends"" with a name rapper, etc. And for the first time, Andre Cymone's own grooves sound more original than his Prince imitations.

FALSE,B-,You Wanna Dance With Me?,Jody Watley,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8604,"

FALSE,B-,Giant,"Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson",1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11362,"
Okay, John, I understand how you go about things. A week or two in the studio with your guitar Freddie and your drummer Emry and a bunch of electric keyboards and organic percussion devices you can beat on yourself. Get rid of the horn guys, sure, you can do without 'em. Write the songs inside; keep them casual, funny, and of course funky. Ideal formula dance music, I agree--no frills. But even disco artists avoid the word ""disco"" in titles these days--sounds gauche. Also, why are you fading your voice back? So that no one notices you're singing about having money instead of not having it? And what happened to the hooks?

FALSE,B-,Tale Spinnin',Weather Report,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8102,"
I used to be cowed by these guys, but all they are is Jeff Beck with liner notes. I mean, wouldn't you know that the finest fusion band in the land would be altogether too damn fine? Yoked to these tunes and concepts, their solidest rhythm section to date--Alphonso Johnson on bass and Ndugu on (trap) drums--only underscores their subservience to technique.

Down from 48 percent to 35 at amiannoying.com, not because they're less annoying but because they're less successful. Annoying they remain, and not, annoying webmaster, because they gigged as Goat Punishment or--who cares?--lost their bass player to the Rentals. They're annoying because Rivers Cuomo is the punk Tom Scholz--a solitary genius in love with big and precise. In Boston's arena-rock, this made sense even though it was annoying. In Weezer's arena-punk (slightly more arena on this outing, and less annoying as a result), it totally misses the point, which from the Ramones to the Libertines has been to achieve concision and economy while just barely remaining erect. Onstage, that is. How Cuomo has comported himself in other areas of endeavor I haven't a clue.

FALSE,B-,Revival,Gillian Welch,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1404,"
Who cares if her polka-dot dress is a costume rather than a heritage? She's got as much right to be a folkie as 10,000 mediocrities and a few dozen geniuses before her. Iris DeMent is a custodian's daughter, Lucinda Williams a poet's daughter, Bonnie Raitt a musical comedy star's daughter, yet from their differing authenticities each has said something unique about the rural South and everyday people. Welch is a songwriting team's daughter who, as is more common, hasn't--not yet, probably not ever. She just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off. Unless you're highly susceptible to good intentions, a malady some refer to as folkie's disease, that should be that.

FALSE,B-,Wet Willie's Greatest Hits,Wet Willie,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8108,"
Alone among Southern boogiemen, the Willies have avoided country as in c&amp;w for country as in funk, and their rhythm section gets away with it--drummer Lewis Ross and bass player Jack Hall are all juke-joint bump-and-grind. In a better world they'd be rednecks in a soul band, but as it is they're stuck in a group with two problems--singer and songs. (Oops, forgot the guitarist, which isn't hard.) Jimmy Hall supposedly combines Ronnie Van Zant's discretion with Gregg Allman's power, but to me he sounds like a cross between Chris Youlden and Lonesome Dave Peverett--with an authentic accent, of course. And although their one lucky strike has been the reggaeish ""Keep On Smilin',"" most of the time they strive fruitlessly for r&amp;b tunes as inescapably elementary as the here-included ""Shout Bamalama"" and ""Grits Ain't Groceries."" I guarantee you that Little Milton isn't going to return the favor and cover ""Leona"" or even ""Baby Fat."" But maybe Stoney Edwards would do ""Airport.""

FALSE,B-,Whodini,Whodini,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8617,"
With the secret of the great rap album still shrouded in mystery, you can't fault this attempt for starting with two intelligent if corny black youths from Brooklyn (cf. Wham! U.K.). But novelty hits do sometimes wear thin (cf. ""The Haunted House of Rock: Vocoder Version""). And though you might get away with producing your album in London or even Cologne, going from one to the other is asking for trouble.

FALSE,B-,A Ghost Is Born,Wilco,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12434,"
Not counting the 11-minute synth drone that Jeff Tweedy says reminds him of his migraines, the most blatant of the mannerisms that riddle this privileged self-indulgence is its dynamic strategy. Play the soft parts loud enough to hear and the loud parts will demonstrate the limitations of your cheapjack sound system, you pathetic transistorized consumer clone. Fortunately, there is a counterstrategy. Play the soft parts as faintly as they deserve and you'll still be able to make out the guitar workouts that are the only conceivable attraction the album will hold for any neutral party not seeking an associate degree in sound engineering. Once Tweedy wrote legible songs. They didn't add up to much because he didn't, but they had their shallow charms. Here he's beyond such compromises. ""Handshake Drugs"" we get, and the NPR-ready one about the best songs not getting on the radio is a clever feint. But it's hard to imagine any of the suckers who fell for the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot hype striving to identify with, say, ""Muzzle of Bees."" Not impossible. Just hard.

Does a fellow as bright and successful as this pudgy eccentric, who once boasted that he looked like a gym teacher from Bryn Mawr, have a right to revel in sentimentality? Maybe. Because unlike the people who make hit singles out of his songs (the Carpenters, Three Dog Night, etc.) he makes it sound as if reveling is fun.
"
FALSE,B-,The Joy of Flying,Tony Williams,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8127,"
For months I've had the nagging suspicion that this special-guests showcase might be that oddity of oddities, a good fusion album. But it's only an interesting one, featuring a duet with Cecil Taylor that has nothing to do with fusion and including among its snappy complexities a snappy tune that is actually fun--the lead cut, Jan Hammer's ""Going Far."" Rest assured that Hammer redeems himself tout de suite on George Benson's ""Hip Skip,"" which like most of what remains is snappy and complex and cloyingly high-tech in the great fusion tradition. But Ronnie Montrose's arena fusillades--unlike Benson's articulate tripe--are also fun. And not only is Williams equally comfortable with Cecil and snappy and heavy metal, he's worth listening to no matter what's in the foreground.
"
FALSE,B-,Brian Wilson,Brian Wilson,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6256,"
What made Brian's utopian fantasy so believable was the guileless hypocrisy of the simpletons fate and family tied him to--his shy, sincere, goofy, subtly tortured lyrics took off from the cheerful hedonism of the Beach Boys' secular chorales and white-boy soul. Solo, the pain in his voice is all too unmediated, and he isn't deep enough to make something of it--he sounds like the sincere, talented, mildly pretentious nut he is. What's more, his multiproduced million-dollar return is weighed down by a collective Phil Spector obsession--comes off incredibly labored. Of course, Smile was probably kind of overwrought too.
"
FALSE,B-,New Moon Daughter,Cassandra Wilson,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=552,"
Compelled to pretend they're superior to the pop text as well as the pop tune, encouraged to express rather than interpret but forbidden to ignore the words, too many jazz singers have trouble figuring out what to make of their material. And however admirable Wilson's independence of so-called classic pop, most of these songs escape her attentions without a mark on them. Which isn't to mention the ""Strange Fruit"" that establishes the surpassing weirdness of Billie's original, or the disastrous Monkees cover, designed to prove she has a sense of humor I'm now convinced isn't there.
"
FALSE,B-,"Third Down, 110 to Go",Jesse Winchester,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8130,"
Winchester's first LP was apolitical on the surface and not without its conservative tendencies, but its brooding lyricism and barely contained ferment reflected the force of will it took for him to flee this country. Here the frustrations of exile seem to have gotten to him--he sounds involuted, willfully slight. The title is a football fan's version of ""(Stuck Inside of Montreal with the) Memphis Blues Again,"" and even more telling is the way he feels about fatherhood: ""I can't get out of that.""
"
FALSE,B-,Learn to Love It,Jesse Winchester,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8131,"
Jesse sounds well. His singing has taken on character and humor and the new songs are pretty good. Yet there's something depressing about his resigned good cheer. Can domesticity be this disappointing--even domesticity confined within a draft resister's Canada? Only if you believe to your Mississippi soul that you were born a rambling man.
"
FALSE,B-,Talk Memphis,Jesse Winchester,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8634,"
For some reason I'd hoped that Jesse's meet-up with Willie Mitchell would inspire both of them to get funky--so much so that at first I mistook tuneful for a substitute. Then I recalled that these days tuneful demifunk is a working definition of pop. And realized that this isn't all that tuneful.
"
FALSE,B-,Wings at the Speed of Sound,Wings,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8137,"
The only substantial talent in this group is bassist-producer Paul McCartney, and he's at full strength only on the impassioned ""Beware My Love,"" although ""Let 'Em In"" and ""Silly Love Songs"" are charming if lightweight singles, and ""She's My Baby"" sounds like an outtake from the ""white"" double-LP by McCartney's former group, the Beatles. In any case, the supporting cast is disgracefully third-rate. The vocals of guitarist Denny Laine are even lamer than those of McCartney's wife and keyboard player, Linda.
"
FALSE,B-,Live,Johnny Winter,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8146,"
Except for the eight-minute ""Mean Town Blues,"" which damn near transforms John Lee Hooker's shuffle into a stumble, this is what every live album ought to be and all too few are: loud, fast, raucous, and to the point. But except for an intense ""Good Morning Little School Girl"" it doesn't get any encores.
"
FALSE,B-,"White, Hot and Blue",Johnny Winter,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8150,"
He was lionized as an authentic bluesman when Rolling Stone discovered him in 1968, and that's how he ended up--only a racist would deny his feeling for this music. Feel is something else. When he's entertaining, he's derivative; when he's original, he sounds shrill.
"
FALSE,B-,Raisin' Cain,Johnny Winter,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8638,"
Up against the Blues Brothers soundtrack (a cousin, like it or not), the vocal gifts of this flashy white blues freak turned steadfast white r&amp;b pro come clear--that drawling, high-pitched growl is his alone, and it's bluesier than Jake and Elwood for sure. On the other hand, Muddy Waters and Bobby Bland cut him. Unlike Jake or (especially) Elwood, and also unlike Muddy or Bobby, he doesn't seem to have a sense of humor. And he'll sing his bass player's songs.
"
FALSE,B-,Arc of a Diver,Steve Winwood,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8639,"
Winwood hasn't been a song artist since Dave Mason left Traffic, but at least here he takes responsibility for his own atmospherics. Instead of consorting with Ijahman or Stomu Yamashta, he's laid down this lulling British-international groove all by himself. Overdubbing, the technique is called. Very up-to-date.
"
FALSE,B-,Roll With It,Steve Winwood,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6233,"
Wish I could claim the music's sapped by whatever moves him to submit material to his beer company before his record company even hears it, but that happened long ago. If anything, this is an improvement--his contempo soul has gained not only bite but speed, so you have less time to think about it. Give most of these meaningless songs to some open-throated journeyman white people have never heard of--Bert Robinson, say, any big-voiced belter who doesn't conflate strain and feeling--and they might even sound like Saturday night.
"
FALSE,B-,The Ideal Copy,Wire,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4196,"
The Wire of punk myth abraded like the smell of gunpowder, fucking in the sand, a scouring pad. This is more like digital sound turned up too loud, a cold shower, a dash of after-shave: chronic alienation converted into quality entertainment. Except on a terrible track that outdoes slow Roxy Music, it's pretty bracing in both rock and disco modes. It's also nothing more.
"
FALSE,B-,It's Beginning To and Back Again,Wire,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6236,"
In an arty variation on the remix best-ofs that pass for new dance product these days, they recorded some concerts and reworked them in the studio and then reworked that. I don't know whether the new versions are better art than the old ones. But formalists rarely can tell the difference between progress and attenuation. And as the ear candy once-removed that is Wire's current calling, this wanders.
"
FALSE,B-,Come as You Are,Peter Wolf,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8648,"
Wolf's propensity to rev into high gear has always been his undoing. Only when he lightens up can he uncover what little nuance he has at his disposal. His solo debut was coproduced by space monkey Michael Jonzun. It was playful. This one's coproduced by his engineer. It's mechanical.
"
FALSE,B-,Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants,Stevie Wonder,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3357,"
Like most great popular composers, Wonder is an appalling ""serious"" one. With their one-world instrumental flourishes and other sound effects, the presumably synthesized ""orchestral"" passages that dominate the first two sides are like bad (!) David Amram at their best (!) and some justifiably anonymous Hollywood hack at their worst. (Major exception: ""Race Babbling,"" especially when it glances a presumably synthesized horn riff off presumably synthesized voices and ostinatos.) And only two of the four songs on side three, which defenders of this album admire, are worthy of Key of Life. But on side four Wonder's indomitable open-heartedness finally breaks through the mawk. ""A Seed's a Star and Tree Medley"" is even more foolish philosophically than most of the rest of the album, but its elan makes Stevie's vitalism palpable, so that even the presumably synthesized orchestral passages that wrap things up sound ardently schmaltzy instead of depressingly schlocky. Still, next time I hope he aims lower.
"
FALSE,B-,Gimme Some Neck,Ron Wood,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8165,"
Ron sounds more Dylany on his new Dylan ditty than Dylan has in a while, and he sounds even better on a song about getting saved (which Dylan didn't write, praise the Lord). He's also induced Roy Thomas Baker to let him and the boys off with a mix as dirty as their rock and roll. But this is a man who should never sing two songs in a row. And he should stay away from lyrics about the perfidy of woman, too.
"
FALSE,B-,Mahoney's Last Stand,Ron Wood & Ronnie Lane,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8164,"
Better moaning bottlenecks than singing strings, but soundtrack music is soundtrack music even when the movie remains invisible, and we all have access to more meaningful background noise.

FALSE,B-,Introducing Eddy and the Falcons,Roy Wood's Wizzard,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3043,"
Catchy though it is--and why shouldn't it be, with Wood appropriating hooks if not entire melodies from the likes of Del Shannon, Elvis Presley, and ""Little Darlin'""?--this collection of iron pyrite oldies may be the most pointless English import since the bowler. On Boulders, Wood exploded the forms he exploited. Here he falls victim to the Grease syndrome--in playing tribute to the teen emotions that fueled rock and roll he comes dangerously close to condescension.
"
FALSE,B-,Old Rottenhat,Robert Wyatt,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8657,"
Set your political statements to unprepossessingly hypnotic music and you'd better be sure your politics are spot on--astute, clear, epigrammatic, correct. Don't deploy a slur like ""aryan"" anachronistically or attribute a phrase of Harold Rosenberg's to Noam Chomsky. Don't insult the genocide in East Timor with minimalist obscurantism. Don't preach to the converted until you've made more converts.
"
FALSE,B-,Just Tammy,Tammy Wynette,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11761,"
This is schlock with conviction, the essential country music parade. But what makes a great country album for urban speedsters like me is lyrics that are worth listening to, maybe even thinking about, and these begin and end with the opening cut, ""They Call It Making Love.""
"
FALSE,B-,Anniversary: Twenty Years of Hits,Tammy Wynette,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3410,"
Her corn pone all husk, her bouffant as sultry as Aretha's do, she sings like the heartbreaker who's about to best the long-suffering wife her lyrics put on a pedestal, but no matter how hypocritical her trademark equation between marriage, submission, and fulfillment, she remains the most soulful female country singer ever. And since she left George Jones (which no one in the world blames her for) and found fulfillment with George Richey a decade ago, her music has gone phfft. Twenty years my foot--the newest song here is a (professional) reunion with George (Jones) that's seven years old. In a world where Greatest Hits, Greatest Hits Volume 4, and George &amp; Tammy's Greatest Hits still exist, this unexceptionable CD-length commemorative issue is about as useful as a kudzu seed. Consult your catalogue.
"
FALSE,B-,Hey Zeus!,X,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6225,"
Stripped of the vicious tensions that made them great--between good and evil, John and Exene, Billy Zoom and Skunk Baxter--they return as the reason young bohos are afraid to grow up. This isn't folk-rock in disguise; Tony Gilkyson's hooks evoke a machine shop, not a barn raising. But they leave going 120 to a bad old black-and-white--even with their seat belts on, the kids in the back would get hurt real bad in a crash. And save hostility for the warmongers--ensconced in separate but functional marriages, John and Exene have nothing to fight about anymore. Which in the usual tragic contradiction leaves the emotion so abstract that the songs are tough to grab hold of. Only the spiteful putdowns--Exene's ""Everybody,"" John's ""Baby You Lied""--sound like old times. Not to mention new ones.
"
FALSE,B-,Go for 2,XTC,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8180,"
Last time they were calling it white music, this time they've released a dub version, and what can you call that except au courant? Or here's another one. It's Andy Partridge who puts the pop in their art-pop, right? If you can tell me whether his ""Mecanik Dancing"" is pro or con, I'll prove to you that his ""Life Is Good in the Greenhouse"" means it.
"
FALSE,B-,Mummer,XTC,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8661,"
Having retired full-time to the studio, the definitive English art-poppers sound more mannered and arid than ever, which is no less bothersome just because it's one way they have of telling us something. By now, there are hints of guilt-tripping in Andy Partridge's awareness of what he isn't, and while ""Human Alchemy"" (""To turn their skins of black into the skins/Of brightest gold"") and ""Funk Pop a Roll"" (""But please don't listen to me/I've already been poisoned by this industry"") are notably mordant takes on two essential rock and roll subjects, Partridge deliberately limits their reach. The eccentric dissonances that sour his melodies and the fitful time shifts that undercut his groove may well bespeak his own sense of distance, but art-poppers who command both melody and groove are rare enough that I wish he'd find another way.
"
FALSE,B-,Oranges and Lemons,XTC,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4228,"
Compulsive formalists can't fabricate meaning--by which I mean nothing deeper than extrinsic interest--without a frame (cf. Skylarking, even the Dukes of Stratosfear). The only concept discernible on this hour-long double-LP is CD. Def Leppard got there first.
"
FALSE,B-,Yachts,Yachts,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8181,"
You have to hand it to a group that can give itself such a ridiculous name and then come up with credible songs called ""Yachting Type"" and ""Semaphore Love."" Actually, most of these songs are pretty credible, even (or especially) the one structured around the word ""tantamount."" Funny boys, no doubt about it. But their biggest joke is a mock-snooty, mock-operatic rock crooning style that I'm not eager to hear again.
"
FALSE,B-,The Yes Album,Yes,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4238,"
Jon Anderson, who delivers the inane Con III lyrics with prissy expertise, and Tony Kaye, whose keyboards run the gamut from vague to overweening, are the bad guys. Bill Bruford, who rocks the rather fancy tempos and signatures, and Chris Squire, best when he gets a good interlock going with Bruford, are the neutrals. And new guitarist Steve Howe makes the record worth hearing if not owning. His commentary throughout ""Yours Is No Disgrace,"" his live acoustic solo ""The Clap,"" and his duet with himself on ""W�"" (that's German for ""worm,"" in case you're interested) make the first side almost interesting, and he's at the heart of the album's one great cut, ""I've Seen All Good People,"" where all their arty eclecticism comes together for 6:47.
"
FALSE,B-,Yipes!,Yipes!,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8185,"
This Wisconsin band is nowhere near as yucky as name and packaging suggest--how can you hate someone who complains that Californians ""got no ceilings on their cars""? Subjects of other cartoons--some simple-minded, some not--include class rivalry, being white, and the cold war. The problem is leader Pat McCurdy, who has one of those ""good rock voices"" that enable the artiste to shout in tune but don't permit much nuance. You can almost see him curling his lip and raising his eyebrows whenever a joke comes up. Oh well.
"
FALSE,B-,Hillbilly Deluxe,Dwight Yoakam,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8667,"
Buck Owens may be his hero, but if George Jones earns a ten for contained intensity and Ricky Skaggs a one, Owens gets an eight and Yoakam maybe a four--he never breaks out of the jams, fixes, and world-historical dilemmas that are country music's reason for being. Reminding us once again that in a genre that's always fetishized tradition, neotraditionalism means immersing yourself in limitation until you convince yourself it's the air you breathe.

FALSE,B-,The Eraser,Thom Yorke,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13560,"
I'd hoped that either I would learn to like this Thommy Boy excursus or the disaffected young professionals who hang on his every megrim would call an anxiety attack what it is. No such luck. Few believe Yorke's solo daybyew has the weight of a Radiohead album, that increasingly rare and invariably overrated thing. But such is the lure of his hypersensitivity that his admirers forgive and even applaud the extreme attenuation of this tastefully decorated click-and-loop. One rationalization is the lyrics, which state his overstated concerns in so many statements rather than camouflaging them in metaphor. And I admit it, the one about the rain is pretty good.

FALSE,B-,Musicforthemorningafter,Pete Yorn,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10331,"
The younger brother of a bigtimeentertainment lawyer and the hottest agent in Hollywood is as neotraditionalist as Gillian Welch, only his chosen tradition is the El Lay sound perfected by Peter Asher and Chuck Plotkin: kempt guitar hooks atop solid drum parts he lays down himself, with some Mitchell Froom-style studio murk for hipness and atmosphere. If you love rock and roll it'll make your skin crawl on contact. If you have a weakness for tune it'll grow on you. Only then, if you have any brains left, you'll wonder why you haven't connected with a single phrase and find more El Lay on the lyric sheet--a fusion of old-style singer-songwriter indirection and new-style song-doctor ur-banality. Honors the diction and cadences of ordinary speech, 'tis said--until there are scansion problems, when up pop anti-idioms like ""the look upon your face"" and ""you were never fond of anything I said."" You said it, buster.

Those who detect surer songwriting and tougher guitar amid the eccentric horns are right, but the horns render such details irrelevant if not unlistenable--their sour blare mimics Young's crude guitar sound all too crudely, and the charts lack that spontaneous spark, as charts generally do. Grabber: solo blues, with solitary trumpet fluttering in the background.

Outtakes and oddments from a too-silly-to-begin-with band who deserve credit for offering to rename ""Beer Money"" ""Pepsi-Cola Money"" if MJ's corporate sponsor will, well, bribe them. In the meantime: ""The beer is free and we're on MTV/And we're opening for the Del Fuegos.""

FALSE,B-,Total Control,Yo Yo,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4264,"
As distasteful as I find Lil' Kim, who conveys even less pleasure in sex than that tragic sensualist Eazy-E, and Foxy Brown, who isn't subtle enough to shroud her vicious fantasies in an aura of mystery, at least they break new ground in candor and aggression. And Yo Yo's East Coast counterpart Lyte has gained in wisdom and principle, while the self-appointed Intelligent Black Woman has gone soft. The beats are a case study in the banality of G-funk, and where once she was a proud, tough-minded observer, here her only winning moments come when she pledges allegiance to her ordinary G and fantasizes momentarily about having babies. These dreams die, she don't know why, and soon it ain't nuthin' but a party where she can find her dream guy--""nice and thick with more dollars than sense."" Hey, didn't she steal that line from Julie Brown or somebody? L.A., what a town.

FALSE,B-,Apostrophe ('),Frank Zappa,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8195,"
Disillusioned acolytes are complaining that he's retreated, which means he's finally made top ten, but that's just his reward for professional persistence. If anything, the satire's improved a little, and the title piece--an improvisation with Jack Bruce, Jim Gordon, and rhythm guitarist Tony Duran--forays into quartet-style jazz-rock. Given Frank's distaste for ""Cosmik Debris"" you'd think maybe he's come up with something earthier than Mahavishnu, but given his distaste for sex you can be sure it's more cerebral instead.

For what it's worth, I thought I'd mention that this collection of outtakes showcases more good music than any Zappa album in years--including its companion piece, Studio Tan, which features a twenty-minute narrative called ""Greggery Peccary"" that could make me defend El Lay. Maybe the secret of Sleep Dirt is that Frank doesn't talk on it. But that didn't help Orchestral Favorites.

I don't want to alienate my target audience or anything, but I can't contain myself: from their offhandedly opalescent songpoetry to their hints of social commentary to their chiming pop polytechnique to their better-name-than-Angst-at-least-only-these-fools-try-and-live-up-to-it, this is one collegiate band. There's hope, though--if they get picked up by Elektra and break through on a fluke video, they may start writing about cocaine and Holiday Inns.

FALSE,B-,Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School,Warren Zevon,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4139,"
I don't know why the title tune's the title tune, except maybe to contextualize the classical interludes he composed all by himself, and Lord help us he's been hanging out with the Eagles, just like Randy Newman, who could teach him something about slandering the South--even Neil Young could do better than incest and Lynyrd Skynyrd, though the brucellosis is a nice touch. In fact, just about every song boasts a good line or three. But the only ones that score are the jokes: Ernie K-Doe's sly, shy ""A Certain Girl,"" and ""Gorilla, You're a Desperado,"" a satire of the Eagles, not to mention Warren Zevon. Don Henley sings harmony. Linda Ronstadt will not cover.

Even on generic rockabilly Gerald Duncan has a way with words, pinning down the thwarted lust that's always added nervous energy to the style. ""Two Girls in Love"" is as fine a lesbians-from-the-outside song as the Amazing Rhythm Aces' ""Emma-Jean,"" and ""Regina"" brings ""Brother Louie"" down home. Duncan comes up with hooks half the time, too. But his singing is so mild and his band so contained that only the most striking material lifts off. Just our luck that in an age of interesting bands with nothing to say an interesting songwriter doesn't put quite enough into the music.

The soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive is no best-of, not with Bon Scott shafted (the tired ""Ride On"") and two of the three new songs instrumentals. Still, one instrumental is showtime, the title tune is really a tune, ""Hell's Bells"" will give Christians fits, and sexual metaphors are kept to a minimum. I wish their only great work of art, the drum-hooked fucksong ""You Shook Me All Night Long,"" wasn't buried on side one the way it's buried in Black in Black. But this is their most presentable collection nevertheless.

This isn't rock and roll, sez here--it's ""sexmusic,"" a/k/a ""antmusic,"" heralding Arapaho (Apache) (Kiowa) (pirate) warrior ideals as a futuristic reaction against Brit-punk nihilism. The scam has whole subcultures working for it in England, but here it's the sex and the music that'll determine whether Adam is David Bowie or Marc Bolan (or Gary Glitter). The sex is your basic line-drawings-of-spike-heels stuff, redolent of Sex, the haberdashery once owned by Adam's ex-manager. The music, needless to say, is rock and roll, a clever pop-punk amalgam boasting two drummers, lots of chanting, and numerous B-movie hooks. Especially given Adam's art-schooled vocals, I find that the hooks grate, but that may just mean that when it comes to futuristic warriors I prefer Sandinistas.

Brutally honest right down to the name, the label promotes South African pop pros Thomas Mkhize and Glynn Storm as ""more structured and somewhat less dense than Ad��������"" praising their ""state-of-the-art production values, modern instrumentation, and pronounced rock, jazz, and pop influences."" In short, decorative exoticism, a touch slick, with pleasing Zulu chant melodies and a trap drummer who'd fit in on Carson. I like every one of its six cuts. And love none of them.

I have hated these Beantowners steadfastly through independent singles, a guest shot at Max's, and Live at the Rat. White r&amp;b with poor epiglottal hygiene, who needed it? Yet I've grown fond of this album. What seemed silly if not self-indulgent eccentricity in a failed thirty-five-year-old rock and roller is brave and funny on an honest-to-God major-label elpee. And ""Lookin' Like a Bimbo"" is an anthem for failed thirty-five-year-old rock and rollers.

A heroin album, take it or leave it--""Junkhead"" certainly isn't ""ironic"" and probably isn't ""fictional"" either. Crunch crunch crunch, riff riff riff--way harder, louder, and more metallic than Soundgarden ever will be. But the price of this power is that it's also uglier and stupider--the sound of hopeless craving. Sitting here with my ""books and degrees"" (well, degree), I very much doubt that if I ""opened my mind,"" as resident sickman Layne Staley suggests, I'd be ""doing"" like him (er, the narrator of the song). I'll wait for my own man, thank you.

Juarez, this sculptor-painter cum singer-songwriter's 1975 debut, was pretentiously half-assed mock mythopoeia; Lubbock (on Everything), his 1979 double, was genuwine laugh-a-minute highbrow-lowbrow. This time Allen's satire is a little thinner, and he undercuts his more sincere songs by playing them for comedy, the only vocal trick he knows. ""Texas Tears,"" ""The Night Cafe,"" and ""Redbird""--plus some funny ones--are recommended to sideman Joe Ely, whose band has always mystified the Panhandle.

Gregg still doesn't know the difference between drawling slowly and singing soulfully, and it isn't tragedy that makes him sound so doleful, it's a limited formal imagination. That said, it must be admitted that he puts a lot into ""These Days"" and ""Midnight Rider,"" and that the reason you can listen to such originals as ""Please Call Home"" and ""Multicolored Lady"" isn't the writing.

Side three is a magnificent testament. It opens with Gregg doing Sonny Boy Williamson justice, wrenches through some of the most formally intense accompaniment Duane ever played, skips into a high-spirited Dickey Betts tune, and provides a coda for a whole sensibility in one two-minute acoustic duet. Side one sandwiches two subordinary Greggeries around an instrumental excursion that sounds like Dickey OD-ing on Live/Dead. And sides two and four comprise thirty-four minutes with an all-too-relaxing theme by Donovan Leitch. I know the pace of living is slow down there, but this verges on the comatose. And all the tape in the world isn't going to bring Duane back.

Showcasing two deserving mbaqanga acts, both fond of squeezeboxes. Good. But as an American who's listened to more mbaqanga than 99 per cent of those who've heard any at all, I shouldn't have to strain to distinguish between the one described as spearheading a ""revitalization of traditional Zulu music"" and the one said to be ""zulu jive's fastest rising group."" Hint: the latter shares a family tree with the Soul Brothers, so bear down on the harmonies.

FALSE,B,I Just Came Home to Count the Memories,John Anderson,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1747,"
He's smart, he's honest, but what makes him a country comer is the edge on his husky baritone, too indistinct and decorative to be called a vibrato or even a burr. His instinctively sentimental reading of ""Don't Think Twice"" establishes the limits of baritone, smarts, and honesty all at once, and I spent enough time pondering whether this was worth a B plus to conclude that I'd have known in a jiffy if I was as familiar with the Frizzell and Delmore covers as I am with the Dylan. Which should tell you what kind of B plus it's worth. This kind:

After declining the Most Inappropriate Cowpunk Band Name Lariat Twirl and qualifying for the Eklekticism Rools Speed Trials, they enter the Music Machine Memorial Songwriting Contest and do all right--you'd swear ""Just to Please You"" (or was it ""Never Going to Apologize""?) was the track that caught you humming on Pebbles VI.

Those who believe the serious and the ponderous are linked at the brainstem will welcome Turner's strained metaphors and sour mood. Those who can't stand it when a bright young band heads for the toilet will try to forget the slick tile that was his Last Shadow Puppets thing. Talented lad, Turner.

""Dance in the Smoke"" is to ""Time of the Season"" as ""Time of the Season"" was to ""She's Not There,"" extending ex-Zombie keyboardist-vocalist-composer Rod Argent's pop breathiness another quantum away from cuteness and toward incantation.

It took me a long time to hear that this forthright (not to say stentorian) black Englishwoman was anything more than a postfeminist Odetta, but it's clear in retrospect that Armatrading was reaching for something more colorful and less pompous even on her apparently folky 1973 debut, Whatever's for Us, produced by Eltonian concertmaster Gus Dudgeon. Two years later, on Back to the Night, she had shucked both the portentous prettiness of Dudgeon and the vague portentousness of lyricist Pam Nestor, but only here, with production from Glyn Johns, does she find a context forceful enough to give her own maturing lyrics an edge. Helps that she's more comfortable singing, too.

Folkies manqu������������������ to the contrary, it's not hard rock she's unsuited for, a point she drives home on the side-openers, which are as nasty as this album gets both musically and emotionally, and also as rousing. What she's unsuited for is pop--the way Steve Li""The Key,"" ""Drop the Pilot,"" and ""The Game of Love"" makes the friendly sentiments expressed therein seem mechanical. And since she's always been a tough broad, maybe they are.

Some faithful decry the bows to pop fashion from lounge to CHR, others hear her fulfilling her destiny. Haven't her fans learned after all these years that beyond raw tunecraft her music is irrelevant? With that proud, brawny voice, she's incapable of pop ingratiation--anything she does is her, and most folks are always gonna think she's weird. P.S.: This time the tunecraft's about average.

Here we come up against the perils of Christianity as a political matrix in black music (and life). I don't doubt the goodness of Arrington's heart any more than I do his Stevie-cum-Bootsy vocal and rhythmic dexterity. But last time he was brimming with charity and full of fun, where now the anxiety that besets anyone who sticks to ""old-fashioned"" values in a time of upheaval erodes his tolerance. So he sounds a little frightened--of gays, of teen violence, of a ""new age"" that won't look like his dreams no matter how many anthems he writes. He misses Martin Luther King a lot. So do we all.

Arrington's bass does pop now, but whether you really get his funk depends on how well you connect with the way he turns the style's loony-toon vocals into pear-shaped tones. Me, I jump only for the synthesized-kalimba hook of ""Young and Ready,"" and he chants that one.

Despite rock instrumentation from Fred Frith, Chris Cutler, and friends and the rousing Who quote that kicks the best original song into high, this music is either consciously antipopular or ""serious"" with pretensions to accessibility. In either case it's Art--political Art, I know. The problem is, I don't get as much out of it as I do out of, say, the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier, or at least Bertolt Brecht and Hans Eisler, whose ""On Suicide"" announces the band's intent. Despite Dagmar's self-indulgent austerity, the stark, atonal music is often compelling, but while the lyrics are never stupid, they do depend on intellectual commonplaces--labyrinth imagery, reference to Greek myth, and other roundabout ways of saying not much. ""In Two Minds,"" about a teenager's schizophrenia, is a commonplace too, but an illuminated one. And the envoi to Piers Plowman is a touch I like.

There's no denying that this concatenation of musical-instrument imitations and collapsing new sound effects generates considerable episodic interest and the occasional groove. But only ""Close (To the Edit)"" sustains much jam, and ""Beat Box"" goes on so long it ends up insulting the memory of ""Rapture"" and Duck Rock both. What some people won't dance to nowadays.

People say they take after the Dolls, but I hear the Boomtown Rats. At its best, their burlesque on a ""teenage jerk off"" (a title) who still gets ""grounded"" (another) is funny and a little nasty. At its worst it's boring and a little too nasty. In between it's got verve and you've heard it before.

They need more to get by, but they can call a filler instrumental ""Bourgi���"" if they want--they've earned it. The important thing is that after writing for Marvin &amp; Tammi (&amp; Diana) for all those years they've finally figure out how to sound like them. Upwardly mobile.

If I gave points for attitude, I'd up this a notch for fidelity to formula: Nick and Val wrote it, Nick and Val sang it, Nick and Val produced it, and they hope you like it too, Mr. Crossover Gatekeeper. But not even ""Nobody Walks in L.A.,"" which makes good on its title but is too quirky and local for a single, takes it on home. So while they go four for eight overall--one-two-three on the first side, lead cut on the second--only their many fans will care.

This band has stopped trying to straddle their original home, West Virginia, and their spiritual one, Berkeley. Now comes the straight country push, and just in case the straight country isn't buying fetching Western swing with a '70s accent, once or twice those fiddles even sound like strings.

Now that its musicianship and production values are established, the album quality of this excellent but marginal band will depend mostly on the song quality.

This year-old effort by Leon Russell and Marc Benno, now re-released, got a lot of nice reviews and no sales first time around, which is more or less what it deserved.  A nice record to write reviews about:  strong studio work with a heavy Zappa flavor, quality of satire ditto.

Produced by the System, a/k/a Mic Murphy and David Frank, they got the juice--all three of these young people possess more mellifluous voices than Murphy, and more singing technique as well. But they don't have as much personality--Murphy's synth-compatible vocal style is far more idiosyncratic and engaging than their postsoulfulness. And in the great artist-producer tradition, Murphy &amp; Frank give up two great conceits for the singles and save the rest for themselves.

These fourteen cuts constitute the recorded output of a late-'70s San Fran punk band best remembered for ""We Are the One,"" the finest U.S. indie single of 1977, and a 1979 Steve Jones-produced EP. The notes extol their ""breakthrough--however brief--into a vision of life expressing firsthand passion and revolt,"" but to me Penelope Houston sounds like a valley girl with too much attitude. If her ""We are not Jesus (Christ!)/We are not fascist (pigs!)/We are not capitalist (industrialists!)/We are not communists"" confounded cant on the single, over the long haul her antipolitical railing, lapsed-Catholic obsessions, and assertions of self-sufficiency protest too much.

This cuts Cut the Cake and finds what Soul Searching was looking for, a tribute not to chemistry but to simple addition. Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart are OK vocalists themselves, and King isn't artist enough to turn AWB into a backing band. But ""A Fool for You Anyway"" and ""A Star in the Ghetto"" are King's meat, far superior to whatever ricky-tick originals AWB might have put in their place. And in the absence of ricky-tick, such AWB shtick as ""Keepin' It to Myself"" and Ned Doheny's ""Get It Up for Love"" sound quite rocky-tock.

Remixing the signature cut from their best (first) album and adding three old B sides that beat the filler off its Knopflerized follow-up, this is cultbound nevertheless: too slight and loose for anybody but converts and mamas to love, or buy. Cf. their new B side, ""Jump,"" which is slight and loose for the ages--Roddy Frame's loaded Eddie Van Halen parody is one of the great art statements in the history of inept guitar.

Rakim raps quick and clean and almost quiet about the business at hand, which is moving the crowd. Eric B.'s grooves approach a classic swing on nothing but scratch and sampled percussion, with touches of horn or whistle deep in the mix.

Though Teddy Riley got the credit, the streetwise sweets of new jack love man Bobby Brown were mostly this producer's doing, and for his star turn he dispenses with the new jack--comes packaged as the title concept, with no prerogatives and not too many fast ones to spoil the fantasy. I mean, after he gets home from work, fantasy enough in the age of structural unemployment, he promises to cook dinner too. This would have serious attractions as a corrective to the sexist fantasies of hip-hop if there was any reason to think neo-B-boys would listen. But it's my guess they'll just take ""Whip Appeal"" literally and figure the guy for a bondage freak.

I don't think these guys imitate the Beatles just so Paul will give them more hits--they've got hits of their own. But from the guitar parts (play ""Better Days"" right after ""I Feel Fine"") and harmonies (the Paul of ""I've Just Seen a Face"" atop the Paul of ""Long Tall Sally"") to concept and lineup, an imitation is what this is, modernized slightly via some relaxed countrification. They write almost well enough to get away with it, too. But somehow the song that stands out is ""Blodwyn,"" a simulated (I think) English folk ditty about a swain and a spoon that has nothing to do with the Fab Four at all.

Greg Graffin's vocals fall into a naturally musical off-key drone that make him sound at times like a mullah in mourning, which is appropriate--he's not as arrogant about his nihilism as most hardcore kids. On the other hand, he's not as funny about it as the best ones, either.

As if they're already a little slow for speedrock and don't want to upset the apple cart.

Selected producers cut Bam's electro leanings with the prescribed heavy guitars, and musically this tops the UTFO albums, say. But neither leader nor followers give up the rhythms or reasons of a ranking MC, and I'm grieved to report that only ""Kick Out the Jams"" overcomes the formlessness of personality his detractors have always charged him with--it's got Bill Laswell all over it.

No kind of sellout, not even a mishmash, just a great DJ trying to reproduce the anything-funky ambience of his parties, go go to reggae to disco to rap. Unfortunately, the ability to hear still ain't the ability to create. On the John Robie-coproduced disco side, ""Reckless"" (UB40 with dance hook) and ""Something He Can Feel"" (Nona Hendryx and Boy George back from limbo together for the first time) are pretty great; so's ""World Racial War"" (Professor Griff please copy) on the Bill Laswell-coproduced funk side.  None of them saves the party from approaching mishmash.

FALSE,B,Rock of Ages,The Band,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3463,"
This live double introduces a couple of covers, a ""new"" song they've been playing for years, and the seven-minute organ precede with which Garth Hudson protracts ""Chest Fever"" in advance, while finding room for only one song from their most recent (and worst) studio album. Yet admirers claim it as a masterwork rather than a commercial stopgap. Nonsense. Given the Band's ordinary woodenness in performance, the playing and singing are spirited, and Allen Toussaint's horn arrangements add genuine punch instead of the usual fuss, although they never reshape--as oppose to redecorate--the material. But this is clearly the testament of artists who are looking backwards because the future presents itself as a vacuum--a problem that has afflicted even their best work.

Look closely at the bull on the back cover and you'll note piss coming out of his pizzle, but even combined with Bandy's vinegar it's not enough. However much you admire his stylistic single-mindedness, hard honky-tonk doesn't pack quite enough wallop in itself--it requires a less austere singer, or inspired material, or the kind of thematic single-mindedness that can make a whole audience love cheatin' songs again.

FALSE,B,"Just Good Ol' Boys Featuring ""Holding the Bag""",Moe Bandy & Joe Stampley,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6356,"
Bandy and Stampley, honchos of the hard-assed nouveau honky-tonk style that is Nashville's answer to Texas outlawism, tend to sound pretty dolorous as solo artists. Bandy is still obsessed with cheating as both doer and done; Stampley's more cheerful, but as an ass man of the sincere-if-bearded school he spends a lot of time singing persuasive ballads. Like most country albums, theirs are spotty; recent song titles include ""To Cheat or Not to Cheat"" and ""I Don't Lie,"" and those are highlights. As a duo, though, they whoop and holler and get hairy, lie to each other's wives and trade wedding rings for outboard motors. The material is still spotty, but since it's always Friday night they can shout right through the spots. All of which goes to show that male bonding is more likely to pick up the tempo than love and marriage.

They have more Beatles in them than Fanny and the Go-Go's combined, but nothing in the songs tells you why they bother or keeps you so busy you don't have time to wonder. It's almost as if the not quite soulful rubber harmonies are ends in themselves--as if these women can't get past their own craft because craft comes so hard to them.

Right, they're maturing into a less derivative pop synthesis, as if that means shit these days. Like the Raspberries before them, they're brilliant when they emulate the Beatles and mature popsters when they don't. And for what it's worth, the four most striking tunes here are the four nonoriginals--every one, for what it's worth, written by a guy.

This set comprises the two albums Barrett made after leaving Pink Floyd in early 1968. The second was released in England just before Atom Heart Mother in 1970, which must have made a striking contrast; in the wake of Floyd's triumph with The Dark Side of the Moon the contrast is even sharper. Barrett coughs when he's not wheezing, he can hardly strum his guitar, and his lyrics are off-the-wall in a modest, workaday way. David Gilmour and Roger Waters back him up (good for them), but sloppily (good for them again); there's no hint of their engineering-student expertise. Admittedly, a lot of what results is worthy of the wimp-turned-acid-casualty Barrett is. But a lot of it is funny, charming, catchy--whimsy at its best. I love most of side one, especially ""Terrapin"" and ""Here I Go."" And while my superego insists I grade it a notch lower, I know damn well it gives me more pleasure than The Dark Side of the Moon.

This is their best album since Sunflower, which is their best of this decade. Brian is aboard, if not in charge. But Sunflower or Wild Honey it's not. The oldies idea isn't itself the problem. But except for ""Palisades Park"" and ""A Casual Look"" the choices might have been more inspired, and the playful, goofy vocal intensity of the black music covers of their youth is often missing. I can deal with the Maharishi stuff by now--it simply underlines the group's public transformation from super-normals into harmless eccentrics--but never again should they commit an I-love-music song. In the current example, rock evolves from the Gregorian chant, an idea I do not consider a harmless eccentricity.

Like so many roots bands, they write good songs and cover better ones--even in a nonpurist movement, Velvets-to-Springsteen-to-Spoonful is a broad-minded parlay. And like so many roots bands, their singers aren't sharp enough to bring it together--can't understand the difference between having fun, making fun, and being funny before mixing them up, can't at least be soulful instead of something vaguer, like ""genuine.""

Except for the deadpan ""Gun Sale at the Church"" and maybe the Johnny Cash impressions, their country-rock is now proudly generic. In a world of lame concepts this approach is jake with me, and if their sharpest song originated with Neil Young, well, they didn't write the flattest one either.

How painful the calculation to become sincere, how arduous the labor to find one's ease. Nobody's saying he isn't talented, and there are some fetching tunes here. But when the most impressive thing about slow songpoetry is the string writing, somebody doesn't have his heart in it, and even if it's not his fault 'cause he doesn't have one, his dolor ends up as cold as his funk. For some that's the idea--a little affectlessness helps the prettiness go down. But whatever irony diehards believe, emotion and intelligence aren't mutually exclusive. Any argument to the contrary calls for active resistance.

FALSE,B,Flash,Jeff Beck,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8206,"
With his customary focus, loyalty, and consistency of taste, the mercurial guitarist plumbs a ""new"" idea copped from such innovators as Foreigner and Duran Duran--funk-metal fusion. Pitting Rod Stewart (on a convincing if utterly context-free ""People Get Ready"") and Arthur Baker (out to produce Foreigner and Duran Duran and apt to do a damn good job of it) against Wet Willie's vocalist and Cactus's drummer, he nevertheless turns in the best LP of his pathologically spotty career by countenancing Nile Rodgers's production on five tracks. So what do we have here? We have half a good Nile Rodgers album, more or less.

Like the reconstructed ""Reelin' and Rockin'"" that opens side two, most of Berry's return to the label of his glory days is tasty, real rockin', and inessential. Also included, however, are two of his greatest songs ever: ""Tulane,"" as canny a take on hippiedom (which Chuck has been struggling to comprehend since he first played the Fillmore) as ""Sweet Little Sixteen"" is on high school, and its sequel, ""Have Mercy Judge,"" the first major blues this supposed bluesman has ever written. History, anyone?
"
FALSE,B,I Am . . . Sasha Fierce,Beyonc,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14342,"
In truth, there are three good songs on this 11-track artifact, and deeply vapid though the split-personality bit is, the trick of dividing the album into two CDs does leave a 17-minute dance disc that can be played without gastric distress by any purchaser who isn't picky about diva gangstaism or videophone porn. But me, I'm a hater, and thus I'm something like outraged, by not just those two pimp-outs but an ""Ave Maria"" lacking even the dumbstruck literalism of Pink's rendition or the grotesque conversion of ""Umbrella"" into ""Halo."" Interpreted autobiographically, this halo seems to adorn Jay-Z, who elsewhere inspires little romantic realism or romantic bliss in his bride. In fact, two of the good songs are rather hard on Jeezy's gender, and mine. When in the third Be claims she's in love with her radio, you can only wonder at her determination to live in the past.

FALSE,B,Cosmic Thing,B-52's,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=206,"
AIDS having robbed them of their most essential musician, this is an almost touchingly brave attempt to dance away from the edge of ecocatastrophe. Earthquakes, tidal waves, bushfires, waste dumps, toxic fog, maybe even that Chrysler big as a whale are counterposed to and in theory renewed by positive natural forces--junebugs, spaceships, cosmic vibes, an expanding universe, poor rebellious kids having innocent fun. They're trying to be seriously silly, and they're right to believe serious silliness is a healer. But between Ricky Wilson's guitar and the permanent defeat his loss doesn't merely signify, they can't quite bring it off. It's enough to make a grown man cry.

One side the 1983 Ruthless EP Lungs, the other the 1984 Ruthless EP Bulldozer, and if you think Steve Albini is less than profound now, here's where you shore up your belief in progress. ""Steelworker"" presages ""Deep Six""'s gothic fantasies about the working class (or is it just guys with muscles?). ""Pigeons"" is a cute bit about an oppressed teenager whose mom makes him kill feathered rodents. Beyond that it's sound and fury.

FALSE,B,Lullabies Help the Brain Grow,Big Boys,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4390,"
If this exemplary hardcore unit can't quite break their LP into the general-interest zone, I begin to wonder whether the new punks are ever going to reach anyone with a full head of hair. The Big Boys are far from monolithic, cutting the blur with ballad tempos and funk rhythms and even horns. Randy Turner's mock my-voice-is-changing squeal has an old (white) blues singer's authority. And their unmistakable heart in no way softens the ranting fury that's the signature of the style. But without a guitar ace (Bad Brains) or a songwriter (Descendents) or both (Black Flag), they cross over only at their best--about six cuts out of fourteen here, including the two slowest.
"
FALSE,B,The Crossing,Big Country,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4392,"
With its bagpipe guitars and Celtic blues lines, Stuart Adamson's Skids-U2 hybrid avoids any hint of rock purism. Although ""Chance"" is the only fully realized song here, the rest sound good from a distance. But I wish Adamson didn't sing like Colonel Bryan Bowie and, even worse, write like Bishop Kahlil Masefield. Regaled with martial rhythms, I always feel safer knowing exactly what the war's about.

First side's the usual homiletics--broad-minded as ever, musicianly rather than dubwise, and nothing his fans need to know. But on side two he gets mad, savoring the phrase ""shit-eating grin"" on ""K.K.K."" and livelying up the tenacious militance of the title track with Afrobeat horns. This is what college radio ought to be for.
"
FALSE,B,The Mysterious Production of Eggs,Andrew Bird,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13177,"
The main reason this record isn't insufferable is that Bird never preens. He shows off discreetly, underplaying his vocal chops and musical command, even his familiarity with scientific arcana--nay, his intelligence itself, which I bet exceeds that of 95 percent of the netcrits his ninth album has had its way with. But discretion exacts a price in identity, clarity, and meaning. The artist may know what these songs signify beyond cunningly arranged wordplay, but anybody else who does ain't talking. Nor does the artist reveal anything about his inner life, specifically including the delight that normally renders the ludic compelling. Certainly there are moments when the music asserts itself--I recommend the chamber-orchestra intro to ""Fake Palindromes."" But in this prog-rock moment, what half saves Bird's mild, pretty, supersmart album is that it doesn't throw the melody out with the rebop.
"
FALSE,B,Tony Bird of Paradise,Tony Bird,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6400,"
Bird hasn't put his strongest material on this record--his debut has more knockout songs (more losers, too), and I once saw him perform a paranoid tribute to the CIA that I'd love to hear again. But he remains such an odd and abrasive singer that he has a right to go a little commercial, and producer John Lissauer knows how.

Elvin's solo albums started coming out in 1969, but this is the first one this fan ever wanted to hear twice. Nothing spectacular, that would violate his sense of propriety--just rocking with a steady roll, perfect for admirers of Robert E. Lee if a mite laid-back for Broadway Bob. Nice to hear a National Merit Scholar make good.

Except for the timeless ""Pickin' Boogers,"" not one of the class clown's hits has the life of ""This Is Something for the Radio,"" which sounds like it was tossed off late one night on ludes: ""We just talkin' over this beat, I don't know what the hell we're doin' . . ."" If you love ""Vapors"" and all those songs with Biz's name in the title but not the credits, figure I'm nitpicking. If come to think of it you don't, wonder yet again how long a street genre can survive high-intensity commodification.

FALSE,B,Jealous Again,Black Flag,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4399,"
Black Flag are committed to rage, not in itself--I don't believe their ""I've got something personal against you"" even though I know it's true--but as a musical principle. Five songs, seven minutes, as arty as no wave, with a comparable relationship to punk precedents, which for L.A. are basic Brit. The sound is extreme and unique, all forced rhythm and guitar blur with no ingratiating distractions--no humor, irony, hooks, or (God knows) melody. Well, maybe irony.

FALSE,B,Everything Went Black,Black Flag,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4400,"
Stuck in legal limbo, they resort to historic alternate-take arcana featuring the three screamers who passed through the band before Henry Rollins took possession--except for side four, which is filled with radio ads for Flag gigs. These are still collector-only, I suppose. But as punk-era Firesign Theatre, worth going out and flattering a geek with a skateboard to hear.

""The Way of the City"" and ""Street Child"" and ""Where Is Love"" and the not-quite-dumb-enough ""One of Those Parties"" don't sound like a country boy's response to the city--they sound like an unreconstructed soul journeyman giving weary moderns everywhere cheap sobs and snickers they might pay for. But as an uneven soul album this scores around 50-50. ""The Way of the City"" is on the up side for its Memphis-New Orleans fusion, one of the few marks of musical development. In the old days soul men usually left tunes as lightly ebullient as ""All Because of What You Did to Me"" to the gals, so that's progress. And the title rap actually does sound like a country boy's response to the city. Inspirational Verse: ""Get the sweetnin' out of gingerbread and never break the crust.""

FALSE,B,Maestra Vida: Primera Parte,Rub���,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4409,"
Willie Colon's vocalist has created a salsa album so artistically ambitious that it brooks no comparison--a music drama complete with synopsis and recorded dialogue that purports to sum up half a century of NuYorican struggle. As a non-Spanish-speaker with access to a privately provided trot, I'm impressed with his reach, his grasp, and his acting ability, but as a veteran of rock opera I feel constrained to note that these things rarely work as planned even when the audience knows the language. Since I'm no salsa expert, I can only observe that both the studied casualness of the production style--songs over backtalk, impromptu-sounding chorus--and the musical-comedy overture seem more effective dramatically than musically. Still, the context helps makes salsa accessible to the nonexpert. And it's possible Blades isn't just smarter than the Neon Philharmonic--he could be smarter than, gosh, Pete Townshend himself.

Although familiarity has tempered my dismay, my first response to Blades's assault on Anglophonia was embarrassment--just what WEA needed, another Jackson Browne album. Admittedly, it's a pretty good Jackson Browne album, with various class acts (Uncle Lou, Elvis C., Sting, and studio luminaries) pitching in for their (and my) favorite Hispanic liberal. When I suppress my corn immunity I'm moved by the AIDS song, the homeless song, and the barrio song. And except for Sting's contribution, I'm impressed by the rest--literate lyrics about Latin America, feckless idealism, and feckless love are never easy to come by. But that doesn't mean they're easy to bring off, and deprived of Seis del Solar's rolling undercurrents Blades is forced to serve them up straight, a skill he hasn't practiced like he has his English. Not that practice would make perfect--cf. Jackson Browne.

Establishing his progressive credentials and his rock credentials simultaneously, Blades commits two progressive rock errors, relying on synthesizers for texture and literature for aesthetic complexity. It's a measure of his gift and his freedom from pretension that between his supple voice and even suppler groove he induces you to listen to the damn synths--and that the words sound (and translate) like they make sense until you bear down line by line.

FALSE,B,His California Album,Bobby Bland,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6413,"
With Bland's old label, Duke, which ABC purchased partly to get at his contract, you cut an LP when you score a single. This is a tragically short-sighted way to treat the greatest pure singer in blues, but it does help guarantee that at least one cut will connect instantaneously, like ""That Did It"" on Touch of the Blues or ""Chains of Love"" on Spotlighting the Man. The pop moves here are no more arbitrary than the ones Bland has always gone for. But whether he's sticking to Duke material or inserting a growl into a Barry Goldberg song, he puts his stamp on nothing.

FALSE,B,Reflections in Blue,Bobby Bland,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6417,"
Blues is an art of narrow margins, and ABC's production honchos push this too far--their two songs are bores, and every time Michael Omartian touches a keyboard or a chart the record dies a little. Not a lot--I really believe he's doing his best. But though there are good moments on all of the seven remaining tracks, only ""I Intend to Take Your Place""--by Jimmy Lewis, a hidden treasure of contemporary blues and soul songwriting--belongs in Bland's canon.

I'm still attracted to Bley's humor, best displayed here in the title piece, a wry take on the charms and imperfections of the mechanical mode. But this is basically desultory, hinting at the feckless formalism an obsession with textures so often conceals.

Perhaps because I expected such miracles from the beginning, I was never turned around by Cream or Traffic, but neither group ever put out a record that didn't contain a track or two that I loved--""I Feel Free"" or ""Paper Sun"" or ""Politician"" or ""Feelin' Alright."" There is nothing here that makes me feel that way: I'm almost sure that when I'm through writing this I'll put the album away and only play it for guests. Unless I want to hear Clapton--he is at his best here because he is kept in check by the excesses of Winwood, who is rapidly turning into the greatest wasted talent in the music. There.

Blow's pop credibility soared when he finally got one of his precious femme choruses on the radio, ruining the otherwise serviceable ""Basketball"" rap. There's nothing quite so intrusive here, and Blow's singing has come up some--in fact, he's now just what the world needed, another serviceable funk loverboy.

The driving, effortless wit and density of Buck Dharma's guitar flourish in this cold climate, but Eric Bloom couldn't project emotion if they let him, and I'm square enough to find his pseudo-pseudospade cynicism less than funny. Subject of ""Dominance and Submission"": New Year's 1964 in Times Square.

Although Sandy Pearlman used to say the Cult's audience couldn't tolerate any suggestion that the band's laser-and-leathers fooforaw was funny, their parodic side has become progressively more overt. What do today's Cultists think of ""Godzilla"" (""Oh no there goes Tokyo"") or the beerhall intro to ""Golden Age of Leather""? I bet some of 'em like laughing at laser-and-leathers, and good. I also bet some of 'em are so zonked they wouldn't get it if John Belushi emceed, and to, er, hell with them.

FALSE,B,Da-Da,Arthur Blythe,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4426,"
Blythe is a major musician and except for one piece of dinky funk this passes pleasantly enough, but its conceptual confusion epitomizes jazz's commercial impasse. Not only does Blythe play safe every which way, but there's no logic to his successes. You wouldn't figure the synthed-up ballad from Brazilian pop romantic Djavan to generate more atmosphere than the readings from Coltrane and Roland Hanna. Or Kelvyn Bell to provide the album's liveliest moment on the other funk attempt. Or the neat remake of ""Odessa"" to generate respectable heat up against the wild one on 1979's Lenox Avenue Breakdown, back when there was reason to hope Black Arthur would beat this shit.

FALSE,B,Bohannon's Greatest Disco Hits,Hamilton Bohannon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6434,"
I listened a lot to this record on the strength of Vince Aletti's description of Bohannon's ""idiosyncratic style: long (five- to eight-minute), bottom-heavy instrumentals with minimal, chantlike or repetitive vocals framed in a nearly unvarying beat pattern so relentless that it's pushed beyond boredom to fascination. Unlike most successful disco music, Bohannon's has few peaks and almost no breaks. . . . The music's very relentlessness and lack of intensity gives it a strangely dead, `off' quality--just as those outer-space replacements for people in science-fiction movies are always vaguely wrong, emotionless."" I agree, yet somehow I'm not fascinated. On the other hand, I've never thought about it while I was dancing.

FALSE,B,Take the Heat Off Me,Boney M.,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6435,"
As in so much German disco, a nice tart detachment undercuts the lush vacuousness here. It's not just that the rhythms are candidly mechanical; even the stiffness of the string playing sounds calculated, as if produced by some fantastic cuckoo clock. Who else could put ""No Woman, No Cry"" and the Peggy Lee version of ""Fever"" belly-to-belly except some European who thinks that whatever crosses the Atlantic is similarly funky and exotic?
"
FALSE,B,Double Bummer,Bongwater,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4431,"
The whole two-record set teeters on the edge of in-joke, avant-bullshit, and not-for-profit self-indulgence. But where the found tape documentaries w/ neoexpressionist noodling are exactly as interesting as their sources (surreal pre-Watergate Nixon, the standard radio evangelist), Ann Magnuson's rock dreams and Chinese ""Dazed and Confused"" and Monkees cover and straight satirical Tuli Kupferberg chantey have the unjudgmental plasticity of the best camp. Can't quite claim she's worth the price of admission--a talent to watch, say.

FALSE,B,Urban Spaceman,The Bonzo Dog Band,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11524,"
Over a year ago these people, who then called themselves Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, released their first album, Gorilla. It was weird and annoying and I sold it. Since then they have put in a guest appearance in Magical Mystery Tour and hit small with the title song of this LP. They are still weird and annoying but I'm beginning to believe--sort of an English equivalent of the Mothers, eccentric rather than freaky, without Zappa's musical ambition or (hence) his pretensions and much superior to the other English-eccentric groups (the Deviants, the Scaffold). Not good rock, God knows. But good something.

FALSE,B,Let's Dance,David Bowie,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=963,"
Anyone who wants Dave's $17 million fling to flop doesn't understand how little good motives have to do with good rock and roll. Rodgers &amp; Bowie are a rich combo in the ways that count as well as the ways that don't, and this stays up throughout, though it's perfunctory professional surface does make one wonder whether Bowie-the-thespian really cares much about pop music these days. ""Modern Love"" is the only interesting new song, the remakes are pleasantly pointless, and rarely has such a lithe rhythm player been harnessed to such a flat groove. Which don't mean the world won't dance to it.

FALSE,B,The Last of the Mohicans,Bow Wow Wow,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4443,"
This Kenny Laguna-produced attempt to convince the record company that Annabella is Joan Jett opens with a cover of the Strangeloves' ""I Want Candy"" that isn't as pointless as one might wish--Annabella being female, the oral metaphors instantly evoke toffee-on-a-stick, and don't think Malc doesn't know it. There's also the nubile ""Louis Quatorze,"" remade in what would be record time for anybody but Malc. And three more sexual fantasies, the most outrageous (and sexiest) of which concerns a consensual gang bang. Unfortunately, Annabella's Debbie Harry impression on that one doesn't convince me she's of age.

FALSE,B,Dimensions,The Box Tops,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10854,"
My weakness for lead singer Alex Chilton is admitted, but this really is the group's best album, a goldmine of ambiguities for nascent producer theorists. I have to grant that Chilton's ""I Shall Be Released"" isn't up to Cocker, Makeba, Simone, or the Band, but that the group should do it at all, as a single, yet . . . Also, dig ""Midnight Angel."" Charged a notch because Bell didn't even bother to list Chilton, much less provide us with the names of the studio musicians who impersonate the group on those sessions.

FALSE,B,Back in Town,Boyoyo Boys,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4447,"
The lead voice of the band that changed Paul Simon's life isn't a voice, it's a rather thin and monotonous alto saxophone, devoid of vibrato or growl--though if the unidentified player had the personality of, say Oliver Lake, he'd still be overmatched by any of dozens of South African singers you can hear. Ain't all that much going on below, either. Take it one cut at a time.

FALSE,B,Workers Playtime,Billy Bragg,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4452,"
He's got a way with a tune and even some money. So maybe it's time to wonder why he has such big problems. Why are women always rejecting him? And why are the people always rejecting him? Not completely, of course--he's a modest success. But in both arenas he falls far short of his putative expectations, and I smell a reason in the barely concealed sob he can't get rid of. From unjust justice all the way to hopeless love, the catch in the throat is kind of seductive--until it starts to stink. This is the voice of a man who expects defeat--not only does he feel born to lose, but he doesn't have what it takes to throw a good wake. So why should the working class follow him to the crossroads? Why should Mary?

FALSE,B,Electronic Eden,The Brains,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4453,"
Put in enough time with this one and despite its dull initial impact every track will give up a hook--a dull hook, perhaps, but in these brite days there's a kind of satisfaction in that. The problem is that the hooks don't connect to much--when the most memorable lyric on the follow-up is about how that guy has got her hypnotized, you begin to wonder just what money has changed, and how.

FALSE,B,The Ascension,Glenn Branca,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4454,"
Okay, so he makes hot ""experimental"" (""serious"") (""classical"") (""new"") music. What we wanna know is whether it's cool rock and roll (""rock""). Not by me. It's great sonically, with ringing overtones that remind me of a carillon or the Byrds, but the beat's overstated and the sense of structure (i.e. climax) mired in nineteenth-century corn. This can be endearing in Pete Townshend or Bruce Springsteen (maybe even opera), but it sounds weak-minded in an artist of such otherwise austere means.

FALSE,B,Talk to La Bomb,Brazilian Girls,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13509,"
The idea that Sabina Sciubba is sexy and sophisticated assumes that one finds sophistication sexy. Many do, of course, especially when shows of sensuality sweeten the deal.

Though at times they sound like country-rock crossover of unprecedented spinelessness, this is basically prime pop--I thought ""Everything I Own"" was a better single than ""Tumbling Dice.""

FALSE,B,Sevens,Garth Brooks,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6170,"
Hyped into what may be the least label-profitable quintuple-platinum album of all time, this is the confirmation of everything Garth-haters believe. But for those with the heart for his avid ways, what happens is an old alchemical switch--where before he channeled his drive to succeed into the emotion of the song, transmuting his ambition as he intensified his music, now his loony need to maintain his unreal numbers distorts material that would be better off without him, or at least it. Not counting ""Two Pi���"" (Jimmy Buffett, get outta his way), the songs are exceptional, but hearing past the gulping self-parody of his ""interpretations"" takes so much out of you that it's hard to tell. If that means the perfect divorce song ""She's Gonna Make It"" is lost to history, NOW should lodge a protest--or work out some kind of cross-promotion, I don't know.

FALSE,B,Hell,James Brown,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6473,"
Great stuff on the two good sides--tricky horn charts, ""Please, Please, Please"" with a Spanish accent, law-enforcement advice. Then there's the side of ballads w/strings, which might be all right if they were also w/voice, and the side that begins ""I Can't Stand It '76.""
"
FALSE,B,Hot,James Brown,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6477,"
This record has a bad rep. Most of it was reportedly cut with arranger Dave Matthews by New York studio musicians and then dubbed over by JB, and the title hit didn't do as well among blacks as David Bowie's ""Fame,"" where its guitar lick first went public. But side one really works. If Brown did cop that lick, he certainly had it coming, and except for the sodden ""So Long"" everything else is touched with the extraordinary, from the cracked falsetto that climaxes ""For Sentimental Reasons"" to the stirring male backup on ""Try Me"" to ""The Future Shock of the World,"" a high-echo rhythm track on which JB does nothing but whisper the word ""disco."" Unfortunately, the dance vamp and ballads overdisc are nothing new, though ""Please, Please, Please"" (with more male backup) sounds fine in its umpteenth version.

FALSE,B,I'm Real,James Brown,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4467,"
Fact is, he hasn't known what to do with his reality, originality, genius, and so forth since the mid-'70s, when disco took the bump out of the JB funk that made modern dance music possible. Though after years of floundering he figured out the new groove, Brad Shapiro still had to show him the ins and outs of its glitz; now that young dance musicians have reacted back to JB funk, cramming and twisting its bottom while running poesy across the top, he needs Full Force (who like Shapiro aren't true genre insiders, just pros who can take the genre to the bridge) to hip him to its lore. Raps and hooks are nothing special. But whether it's live or Memorex, the dense hostility of the drum attack is both fresh and in the tradition--his tradition.

The goal of Pete's bold request is of course his bedroom. That's where he keeps his synthesizers, pianos, drums, and tape machines, and what he has in mind for you is some guitar or maybe a little background singing. Who needs discos, except to finance the next one? Fantasy love affair indeed.

In which the spirit and guts of Joy of Cooking, united for maybe the last time (Toni has left to record solo with another label), go to Nashville for some country-fried. Needless to say, they've never enjoyed more professional backing, but especially in Nashville there is a well-known problem with professionals--they never push a song that extra notch. And at least half of these could use the help. Shouldn't be lost: ""Midnight Blues.""

FALSE,B,Jackson Browne,Jackson Browne,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6487,"
Many people I like like Browne. Me, I don't dislike him. The voice is pleasant, present, and unpretentious, and when I listen assiduously I perceive lyrics crafted with as much intelligence and human decency as any reasonable person could expect. Unfortunately, only critical responsibility induces me to listen assiduously. It's not just the blandness of the music, but of the ideas as well, each reinforcing the other. Even the meticulously structured requiem ""Song for Adam"" interests me more for the quality of Browne's concern than for its philosophical conclusions. When Bob Dylan's good, I admire him as much as I do William Carlos Williams. I admire Jackson Browne as much as, oh, John Peale Bishop, whose name hasn't entered my mind since I was an English major.
"
FALSE,B,For Everyman,Jackson Browne,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6488,"
The singer-songwriter folk are lining up behind this one as album of the year, but though I'm intrigued by Janet Maslin's suggestion that Browne fuses New York and California sensibilities, sometimes I'm afraid all she means is that he can read. Even as he lists toward the pretentious and the vague, the reflective evenness of Browne's delivery sets up an expectation of cogency that on this album is satisfied only by such relatively unambitious songs as ""These Days,"" ""Red Neck Friend,"" and the charming ""Ready or Not."" Which save it for me.
"
FALSE,B,The Pretender,Jackson Browne,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6490,"
This is an impressive record, but a lot of the time I hate it; my grade is an average, not a judgment. Clearly Jon Landau has gotten more out of Browne's voice than anyone knew was there, and the production jolts Ol' Brown Eyes out of his languor again and again. But languor is Browne's best mask, and what's underneath isn't always so impressive. The shallowness of his kitschy doomsaying and sentimental sexism is well-known, but I'm disappointed as well in his depth of craft. How can apparently literate people mistake a received metaphor like ""sleep's dark and silent gate"" for interesting poetry or gush over a versifier capable of such rhyming dictionary pairings as ""pretender"" and ""ice cream vendor"" (the colloquial term, JB, is ""ice cream man"")? Similar shortcomings flaw the production itself--the low-register horns on ""Daddy's Tune"" complement its somber undertone perfectly, but when the high blare kicks in at the end the song degenerates into a Honda commercial. Indeed, at times I've wondered whether some of this isn't intended as parody, but a sense of humor has never been one of Browne's virtues.
"
FALSE,B,Lives in the Balance,Jackson Browne,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4471,"
These antiwar songs give him plenty in common with Holly Near--he even puts nueva canci������������������n musicians on the title track. While Browne goes in for higher octane folk-rock, I'll pass on the remixes if you don't mind. The difference is that Browne shouldn't be doing this--however goody-goody his fans or political his recent rep, he's a pop star who's stretching his audience and endangering his market share merely by making such a statement in 1986. And he's thought hard getting here--not only does his way with words render these lyrics somewhat deeper than Holly Near's, but his moralistic put-downs have that edge of "

May he remain a protest singer in perpetuity, and not just because I wish his love songs were history. But n.b.: the two standouts are ""My Personal Revenge,"" a pledge of forgiveness by Sandinista hardliner Tom������������������s Borge, and Little Steven's--yes, Little Steven""I Am a Patriot."" You think the secret flaw of the archetypal singer-songwriter might be songwriting?

FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,B.T. Express,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4473,"
All ye need know of the Average Black Band, with their straight-ahead ""Old Gold"" tricked/tripped up in the remix to mesh with ""Future Gold"" that's worth its weight only in the minds of suckers for a glitzy prospectus.

FALSE,B,Greetings from L.A.,Tim Buckley,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6497,"
Perverse as it may seem, Buckley's mannered, androgynous moan has real erotic appeal for some, and here it turns a trick. This is rock pornography if anything is, complete with whips, foot fetishes, meat racks, and salacious gasps, and while I wouldn't call the band hard-core, it definitely fills the groove.

FALSE,B,A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean,Jimmy Buffett,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6498,"
My shit detector went crazy the moment I spied the admiring apostrophe by sports novelist Tom McGuane, and indeed, Buffett shares McGuane's sexism (he likes Key West because ""the ladies aren't demanding there""), covert nostalgia, reverse preciousness, and brain-proud know-nothingism. But his good-old-boys songs are classics of sheer hair, making up for the overt ""They Don't Dance Like Carmen No More"" and the know-somethingish ""Death of an Unpopular Poet."" And a vignette called ""Cuban Crime of Passion"" has Dickensian heart.
"
FALSE,B,Havana Daydreamin',Jimmy Buffett,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6501,"
Undeniably, this romantic individualist has staked out his surf; perhaps it is because his utopian sunland is Florida (rooted in the South) rather than California (headed toward the Orient) that his songs are so adult, skeptical, and closely observed. He doesn't sentimentalize in any obvious sense--the outsiders he sings about (including himself) are neither pitiable victims nor heirs of unacknowledged privilege. But when he essays some lyricism (about his grandfather, say, or the ""so feminine"" mandolin) he becomes totally mawkish, revealing a softheadedness that in the best Hemingway tradition he is careful to conceal most of the time. And upon close analysis this softheadedness extends even to his best lyrics--he is so intent on the day-to-day that he never cultivates an overview. Buffett is singing with new lustre, and I can't bring myself to put this down. But I don't expect to be putting it on much either.
"
FALSE,B,Son of a Son of a Sailor,Jimmy Buffett,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6503,"
Buffett is very good at what he does, and it says a lot for his composing that the two changes of pace by Keith Sykes are the least memorable cuts on the album. But Buffett's band can't quite cut the funny, intelligent good-time music that is his forte. Anyone who gets up and boogies to rock and roll as routine as ""Livingston Saturday Night"" has been shaking ass to whatever came off the bandstand since he or she reached drinking age. On record, there happens to be better and more functional music available.
"
FALSE,B,Guilty!,Eric Burdon/Jimmy Witherspoon,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6510,"
Burdon has a clumsy knack for coming out on the other side of a bad idea--after ""Monterey,"" which was just silly, ""Sky Pilot"" seemed transcendently silly. And while his stint with War symptomized his chronic racial confusion, he gets on quite well with Witherspoon--especially considering that 'Spoon is said to represent Kansas City class while Eric supposedly epitomizes Newcastle nowhere. Maybe the truth in both cases is less extreme. Anyway, neither singer comes up with anything definitive here, but both deal soulfully--sometimes almost indistinguishably--with these solid, politically tinged songs, and a sharp young guitarist named John Sterling provides a few highlights.
"
FALSE,B,Proud Mary,Solomon Burke,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10833,"
Solid and soulful as always. Self-produced in Muscle Shoals, it's not quite up to his Atlantic stuff, but close enough. Includes a strong rendition of ""That Lucky Old Sun,"" usually a death-trap (especially for black singers) because it's been done so often. That took balls, so I won't charge him for being slightly under time: 29:25.
"
FALSE,B,Dry and Heavy,Burning Spear,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6515,"
The sweetness of Winston Rodney's vocals here is surprisingly acute--especially on the unselfrighteous nonviolence sermon ""Throw Down Your Arms,"" the generalized love song ""Any River,"" and the title cut, an impressionistically spaced-out reminiscence of his schooldays. But despite the welcome crib sheet I don't find that any of the other tracks holds my attention. That's the way it is with sweetness.
"
FALSE,B,Live,Burning Spear,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=506,"
Top material at Jamaican tempos for a London audience of 2000. But as usual the ceremonial extensions, while appropriate formally, call out for the physical presence of fellow worshippers. And would sound more lifelike in a studio.

FALSE,B,Hail H.I.M.,Burning Spear,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4480,"
Strange to hear it come down to material in a singer so infused with the spirit. But what I remember is what I don't remember--the difference between the first three songs, ""African Teacher"" and ""African Postman,"" and ""Cry Blood Africans,"" except that the last one has crying in it. Maybe it's the well-known positivity problem, because when he's angry he comes across: Columbus was a ""damn blasted liar"" indeed.
"
FALSE,B,Mistress Music,Burning Spear,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=509,"
This kicks off with one of Spear's strongest and strangest songs--""Tell the Children,"" which rather than inculcating them with doctrine informs them she's their mother but Spear's not their father. What's the mystical symbolism, one wonders. Answer: there is none. With the third song called ""Woman I Love You"" and the fifth all ""Girl I love you,"" I guess this is just music for his mistress--or to be precise, mistresses.

FALSE,B,Hounds of Love,Kate Bush,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4489,"
Just as her music says she hopes everyone does, I respect and like this woman. Though it's tempting to slot her with Laura Nyro, you never get the sense she's a fool--she's more circa-Hejira Joni Mitchell. Her best songs can't match their best, but sonically she's magnificent, out-stripping her art-rock mentors, and it would be churlish to deny her to audiophiles and/or young women seeking independent role models. Nevertheless, to be a Romantic with a capital R in 1986 is to be a Victorian like Tennyson, who provides Bush her epigraph. It is deliberately to cultivate a sensibility whose time you know perfectly well has passed.
"
FALSE,B,The Sensual World,Kate Bush,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4490,"
The longing for contact and obliteration are themes grand enough to support a little grandiosity, and because she's smarter than the average art-rocker, she brings something worth telling to them--even something worth ""expressing."" She knows herself better, too; typical that her roots move is Trio Bulgarka rather than some Afro-source having nothing to do with who she is. Just wish she convinced me the Trio Bulgarka had more to do with who I am. The title song could give Henry James a boner. The one where her beloved turns into Hitler is art-rock.

FALSE,B,Nothing Says I Love You Like I Love You,Jerry Butler,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6520,"
This is indeed the Ice Man's best LP since he last recorded with Gamble-Huff in 1970--seductive, substantial, felt. But only the dance cut, ""Cooling Out,"" with Leon Huff heating up on piano toward the close, is really worth playing for people you don't care about going to bed with.

FALSE,B,Better Days,Paul Butterfield,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6523,"
Butterfield's new band--a Woodstock roots-blues supergroup of honest men singing honest songs--is his clearest concept since 1965. Unfortunately, the music is so relaxed it sounds as if they decided--collectively, of course--that laid back meant lying down.

FALSE,B,Live Pcppep,The Butthole Surfers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3512,"
At first I detected an emotional power signifying something more than an arty posthardcore band whose outrageousness was truly original. But soon I noticed that one of the three new songs--striking statistic in a band whose recorded output comprises two longish EPs--was a noise interlude. So now I'm wondering whether they mightn't be an original posthardcore band whose outrageousness is truly arty, or whose emotional power is truly a fake. Oh well--at least they'll evolve toward big-beat no wave (performance art?) rather than heavy metal.

Subtitle: ""Electronic Fantasies for Patriotic Synthesizer."" Further description by artist: ""This album is a series of aural and spatial fantasies evoking the spirit of American patriotic music."" I quote because I can't think of a way to say it better myself, a symptom of my failure to connect with these great old tunes despite my admiration for both the pride and humor of the concept and the confidence of the execution. The abstractness here may be appropriate--is appropriate--but that doesn't mean it isn't alienating. All lovers of American music should try to hear this record. But not even the ""Internationale,"" which Byrd managed to sneak in somehow, moves me to wave the flag for it.

If their first greatest hits was (in Paul Williams's deathless phrase) ""an essay into rediscovery,"" this one's a product into recouping. Thing is, a good statement could have been constructed. Let Notorious and Sweetheart stand on their own (though one song apiece is acceptable anyway), leave the anachronistic ""He Was a Friend of Mine"" in the dustbin of history, and tell Skip Battin to make his own album. Then pick a few more cuts--""Deportee,"" ""Old Blue,"" ""Child of the Universe""--from Easy Rider and Dr. Byrds. Presto: Roger McGuinn's Greatest Quirks.

Having turned soul artist just as the style was going out of fashion, he's now earned a following in Africa and the Caribbean, and more power to him. As you might have guessed from the title, this isn't up to the standard of Sex and Soul--strings, thinner material. But it's quirky and basic, with witty horn charts and a vocal attack that now seems pleasantly anachronistic. Killer cut: Roy shoots a friend who's in bed with Roy's wife and is inspired to the moral reflection that now he's ""in a whole lot of trouble.""

After years of combatting pretentiousness we discover that unpretentiousness can be just as bad. These murmured blues meditations are so easy on the spirit that even though they have their charms they invite the mistrust of moralizers like myself--there's just too much talent here to justify such slight results. Or maybe there isn't enough talent to justify such minimal effort--only if all the songs were as absolutely beguiling as the side-openers, ""Call Me the Breeze"" and ""Crazy Mama,"" would the lassitude affected by all hands be as comfortable for us as I'm sure it was for them. Push a little, fellas, it'll feel so good.

Cale outdoes such self-created white bluesmen as John Hammond by writing songs that are locked up in the conventions of the form, designed solely as carriers of pulse and mood. His slurred, whispering vocals and slurred, stuttering guitar are stylistic constants, and his lyrics aspire to the meaning-free universality of the traditional blues tropes and phrases. Mesmerizing, in its way. But the very best blues simply aren't meaning-free or locked up formally--John Hammond selects his repertoire for variety and interest, as does Lightnin' Hopkins, so why shouldn't Cale? Even if his style were as distinctive and forceful as any of dozens I could name, the fact that he consciously chooses his limits robs them of their natural aura. No surprise that the most gratifying tracks here break the mold with a little mystery--especially ""Playing in the Streets,"" with its infusions from Vassar Clements.

FALSE,B,The Academy in Peril,John Cale,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1758,"
There must be more straightforward ways of imperiling the academy than mock-classical mock-soundtracks. Granted, this sounds jake to me, and my continental friends tell me it's excellent of its sort. But I don't much care for the continent (or the sort)--that's why I had to ask them. Rock and roll: ""The Philosopher,"" for acoustic guitar, brass, woodwinds, and (eventually) violins over strange percussion, and ""Days of Steam,"" which reminds me of the Ernie Kovacs theme.

FALSE,B,Sabotage/Live,John Cale,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6537,"
""Military intelligence isn't what it used to be,"" Cale intones on a title cut replete with slash and yowl. ""So what--human intelligence isn't what it used to be either."" Speak for yourself, John. This material, based in part on Cale's recent inquiries into foreign affairs, is fairly strong in a geocynical way that's a lot newer to rock than it is to human discourse in general. But the live recording, while no doubt economical, gets more flash than slash out of Marc Aaron's guitar and not enough singing out of Cale. And ""Captain Hook,"" the dumbest song on the record, lasts 11:26.

FALSE,B,Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds,Randy California,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6538,"
Almost universally dismissed as a lysergic self-indulgence, the departed Spirit's tunefully distorted guitar (and vocal) showcase will grow on you if you give it half a chance--any Joe Walsh fan who lets it get by never really liked the '60s to begin with. For sheer dense weirdness it beats King Fripp, and if I had any passion for such things I'm sure I'd love it. Like most of side one a lot as it is. And where else are you going to find covers of ""Rain,"" ""Mother and Child Reunion,"" and current James Brown on one album?
"
FALSE,B,Alligator Woman,Cameo,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4497,"
Funkateers think this is ""new wave"" not just because the title hit sounds like the B-52's but because secret virtuoso Larry Blackmon keeps the groove stripped down and off balance. Unfortunately, the hooks are few, the humor is forced, and the ballads suck. For theoreticians mostly.
"
FALSE,B,Word Up,Cameo,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4499,"
Larry Blackmon's a funny drummer, and I wouldn't say albums are something he just gets away with. But Vince Aletti named his column ""The Single Life"" after Blackmon's last significant effort for a reason. So buy the twelve-inch. And if you want more, wait for the best-of his current masterpiece makes inevitable.

FALSE,B,High Mountain,Canyon,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6540,"
This mysteriously uncredited white-soul-with-black-chorus-and-steel-guitar concoction apparently emanates from one Jerry Williams, who is capable of attaching solid words to solider melodies. Unfortunately, that uncredited quality extends to the gestalt, which is a little anonymous. But if ""More to You"" and ""Please Don't Leave Me Again"" sink into oblivion, no one will blame me.
"
FALSE,B,Raving Tonight,Don Carlos and Gold,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4501,"
Like so many dread heartthrobs, this long-ago Black Uhuru co-founder loves Jah more than Woman, which whatever its limits sure beats hating Woman. In the hallowed reggae tradition, the melodies all seem to have been written by the same gifted five-year-old, who wins gold stars only for ""Music Crave"" and ""Spread Out."" But his way of taking off from a simple refrain gives reggae's religious impulse a musical dimension this unbeliever can feel in his soul, or whatever it is.

FALSE,B,Suburban Voodoo,Paul Carrack,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11041,"
These songs are catchy and apt (""Don't want no washed-up dishes soft-soaping me,"" eh?), and unlike his pop mentors in Squeeze (he was on board for East Side Story) and Noise to Go (bandmate Nick Lowe produced and helped compose), Carrack seems to Mean It--he's soulful in the manner of somebody like Allan Clarke (of the Hollies, how could you forget?). In fact, I bet his sincerity is the envy of his compulsively ironic co-workers. Unfortunately, it leaves me wondering whether he's a little simple-minded or a minor con man.

Even when he was nervoused out Joe King always used to be fun because what kept him going was high spirits--at worst, a little extra adrenalin. Now he sounds as hyper and overextended as Richard Gottehrer's production. Good parties are such fragile things.

Seven numbers previewed on these ""basement tapes 1979"" made the Crowns' Billy Altman-produced debut, and though some claim the demos have more spirit, nobody's ever accused Altman of slick.

They've always cultivated a dark side--girls make boys want to end it all even after the boys have grown up. They've always basked in the shadow of Roxy Music, too. But they've never been so stylishly nightmarish--except for the title cut, even the fast ones don't aim for fun.

FALSE,B,Musical Shapes,Carlene Carter,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4512,"
Touted as the next Marshall Chapman since she surfaced in 1978, Mother Maybelle's most famous granddaughter and Nick Lowe's most famous wife comes up with enough nasty, compassionate songs to make believers out of Marshall's followers, all seven hundred of 'em. Dave Edmunds cameos as a chow-sucking trucker, Nick has the synth to light up ""Ring of Fire,"" and Carlene has the balls for ""They got the balls and I got the bat."" But she can't muster the insouciance one would expect from the Mary Magdalene of Cool.
"
FALSE,B,Peter Case,Peter Case,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4513,"
Case's problem is that he's a born actor who won't cop to it. Folkies have always enacted authenticity, and great ones from Dylan to Roches have role-played with a vengeance. But by pretending that his songs are about ""sin and salvation"" rather than the more problematic ""America,"" Case evades challenges to his new homespun persona--supposedly, sin and salvation are everybody's heritage. And hence he's no more convincing now than he was when he led a group named after the Beatles' sneakers.

Except for Bonnie Raitt, this is as good as the female-interpretive genre got in 1979: Cash is cool and feisty, and Rodney Crowell and Keith Sykes both find nice twists in the pains of love. But the session men sound so dead they gotta be trying. Is this some weird kind of El-Lay-goes-Nashville statement? Or just the end of an era?

FALSE,B,Old Wives' Tales,Exene Cervenka,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1221,"
Always a notebook-toter, she goes for the roots and poetry you'd expect--in other words, folk-rock. Her protest-tinged sincerity cries out for jolts of junk guitar. But sisterly tales like ""She Wanted"" and ""White Trash Wife"" detail the natural feminist sympathies rock and roll floozies--who God knows have plenty to do just protecting their asses--rarely have time for. Pray for the X versions.

FALSE,B,Blondie Chaplin,Blondie Chaplin,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6561,"
The trick with this very attractive record is to approach it as an intense and knowing exploration of the conventions of modern rock and roll. That way you can immerse yourself in its raceless melisma, raving overdubs, and produced grooves as if engaging in a meaningful activity. But it is customary in projects of this kind to distinguish between exploration and exploitation, readymade and clich������������������, aural depth and aural surface, by means of a few hints in the lyrics (cf. Dave Edmunds or Dwight Twilley). Chaplin doesn't--can't bear "
FALSE,B,"Me, I'm Feelin' Free",Marshall Chapman,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6562,"
I can't figure out whether this tough, alert Nashville rebel fails to reach me because I'm uncomfortable with a woman who comes on like a good old boy or because I'm uncomfortable with anybody who comes on like a good old boy, but I like her enough to hope it's neither.
"
FALSE,B,Marshall,Marshall Chapman,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6564,"
This ""rock and roll girl"" is a lot more confident, clever, and animated than such Northern counterparts as Ellen Foley and Ellen Shipley, but she's a fairly one-dimensional conservative compared to Pearl E. Gates or Chrissie Hynde. Not only does she never question what she wants, which I guess is OK, but she still equates rock and roll itself with liberation, which isn't. The reason it isn't is illustrated by her band, who reprise old boogie licks as if they're expressing themselves.
"
FALSE,B,Crossroads,Tracy Chapman,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4031,"
I like her best here when she's most objectionable--keying her politics to the anachronistic locution ""government relief,"" making her lover commit first, identifying evil with white people. She's still too solemn, but at least she's not too tasteful, and how else do you describe a musician who gives the impression of singing solo with her acoustic guitar while deploying five or six musicians a track? As a musician who gets over on her voice, that's how.
"
FALSE,B,Love Country Style,Ray Charles,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5272,"
As satisfying as Charles's first c&amp;w records were conceptually and vocally, I was always a little turned off by his countrypolitan taste for strings and choruses, and they're still with us--more muted, but also more prosaically arranged, except on the godawful ""Good Morning Dear."" Still, the first side is pure Charles country--eccentric and sexy, which real country rarely is, and funny as only Charles can be. I wonder what Johnny Cash will make of the almost inaudible lowdown whisper that closes ""Ring of Fire."" Love it, probably.

The best songs here, one by Ray and one by Jimmy Lewis, warn the ladies about the perils of liberation, while the worst (not counting the McKuen-Brel) are by tyros named Ann Gregory and Sadye Shepard, both of whom work for his publishing company. Feminists please advise.

So you thought Stevie Wonder's ""Living for the City"" and Randy Newman's ""Sail Away"" were definitive, eh? Well, they are, but try these anyway. And then tell me why Little Milton's version of ""We're Gonna Make It"" cuts Ray's. And how the hell he found a Charles Aznavour song more mawkish than the worst McKuen-Brel. And whether he commissioned the translation himself.
"
FALSE,B,Wish You Were Here Tonight,Ray Charles,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11417,"
Two decades ago, on Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Charles transfigured pop, prefigured soul, and defined modern country &amp; western music. This return to a symbolic Nashville (recorded in his own L.A. studio, natch, though unlike 1970's Love Country Style it leans more heavily on banjo-mandolin-steel than on Sid Feller's strings) celebrates his latest contract with yet another rehash of his jokey, deeply felt shtick. Not that it can't be great shtick. But he's always better off grabbing other people's classics than trying to create new ones from scratch, and I bet he's got publishing on three or four of the songs you never heard of.

I like their looks--two pretty-boys balanced off by two ugly-guys--and have no objection to their sound, which recalls the Aerosmith of Rocks. Nor am I shocked that they're not as powerful as the Aerosmith of Rocks, Jack Douglas or no Jack Douglas. But given their harmony singing you think they'd try and be more melodic. Sign of smarts: the way the phrase ""any time at all"" hooks ""He's a Whore.""

Yeah, I'd written them off too--until I heard ""If You Want My Love"" once and immediately made it twice, after which it went on automatic replay in my head for forty-eight hours. The most eloquently eclectic Beatle tribute ever recorded, it sets the tone of this one-of-a-kind arena-rock band's raw, ersatz tug of war, and though Rick Nielsen's Lennonesque tunes and Robin Zander's McCartneyesque screams do grate (and not against each other), I'll take it cut for cut over Paul's sweet, authentic one.

If I'm opposed to music that lays fantasy trips on the unsuspecting, then why do I dig these two prepubescents--Peaches &amp; Herb cum Jackson 5--singing about rings and things?

FALSE,B,Out West,Clifton Chenier,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6571,"
As the king of the accordion-based Louisiana blues known as zydeco, Chenier is revered among such patrons of the folk as Arhoolie's Chris Strachwitz, who has now recorded six albums with him. This is a good thing, I guess, but Chenier strikes me most of the time as a big frog in a small bayou--in French or English his slurs and impassioned moaning are pretty automatic, and the most distinctive thing about his accordion playing is that he plays accordion. This album adds Bay Area guitarist Elvin Bishop and pianist Steve Miller to Chenier's six-piece lineup, and I welcome the impurities--Miller is nothing special, but Bishop's solos give Chenier room to breathe and something to test his strength against. The only loss is Cleveland Chenier's counterrhythms on rubboard, which sink into the mix, but with Arhoolie that's always a danger anyway.
"

Especially in a rhythmically conservative style like zydeco, it's rare that a band can carry an album, but that's the story here. First record I've ever heard hot enough to convince me that all those wild tales about the accordion man weren't so much pepper sauce. Just too bad it happened after he began to lose his strength.

It's OK that producer-singer-songwriter Eugene Record has written an entire album for the male supplicant he created. But it's not OK that except for the folk-kitsch masterpiece ""Oh Girl"" (a/k/a ""Oh That Harmonica"") not one of these songs is going to get him what he wants--true love, a roll in the hay, a hit single, anything. Nor is it okay that he bids fair to turn into the falsetto Isaac Hayes on ""A Lonely Man"" (a/k/a ""Have You Seen Her Yet"") and ""The Coldest Days of My Life"" (a/k/a ""The Longest Song I've Ever Written"").
"
FALSE,B,"Greatest Hits, Vol. 2",The Chi-Lites,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6578,"
They're still a better-than-average harmony group, but their moment is past, and although they continue to handle brisk tempos more deftly than the competition their accommodations to disco are just that--compromises, not expansions. Eugene Record's lyrics offer more than the music, which he often farms out these days: ""A Letter to Myself"" is classic silly self-pity, I leave it to your to imagine how ""Homely Girl"" turns out, and ""That's How Long"" (which Record didn't write) is as graphic a song as has ever made 54 in Billboard.
"
FALSE,B,Like Flies on Sherbert,Alex Chilton,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4531,"
Right, this bag of wrecked covers and discarded originals is, what's it say here, ""self-indulgent."" If Keith Richards or Rat Scabies were to dare such a thing, I'd throw it in the garbage myself. But that don't take nothing away from ""Baron of Love, Pt. II""--the opening cut, in which composer Ross Johnson raves distractedly about sex and gore. Or the line about nipples in ""Rock Hard."" A very bright music nut who knows from the inside how much craziness goes into the most normal-seeming product (he did front the Box Tops, remember), this long-time advertisement for self-abuse doesn't prove craziness is universal. Just makes you forget that things most certainly wouldn't be more fun if it was.
"
FALSE,B,Remote Luxury,The Church,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4538,"
I see these Aussies as the wimp Del Fuegos--musically they wind up just where they want and epistemologically they go next to nowhere. All right, so the songs are quite pretty in a modernized early-Faces/late-Zombies kind of way--more consistently so than the '60s competition (which gives them a leg up on the Fuegos, who like the macho boys they are take on the Stones). I even get the point: the sweet, melancholy alienation the band cultivates is an attractive alternative to the crass pragmatism and/or self-righteous nihilism of their contemporaries. But where my own fave formalists the Shoes are honest enough to focus their lyrics on the very limited social milieu essential to the nurture of such alternatives, these guys evade specifics via metaphor and have the presumption to reproduce their hazy poetry on the inner sleeve. Which may help explain why the music sometimes almost drifts away.
"
FALSE,B,Starfish,The Church,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3538,"
Anybody who can't hear this album's pretty textures and expert hooksmanship has problems with his or her central nervous system. I mean, facts are facts.

One great r&amp;b instrumental (""Slunky""), two tracks that deserve classic status (""After Midnight"" and ""Let It Rain""), two that don't (""Bottle of Red Wine"" and ""Blues Power""), and well-played filler. I blame a conceptual error, rather than Clapton's uncertain singing, for the overall thinness. As a sideman, Clapton slipped into producer Delaney Bramlett's downhome bliss as easily as he did into Cream's blues dreamscape, but as a solo artist he can't simulate Delaney's optimism. I mean, a party song called ""Blues Power"" from a man with a hellhound on his trail?

A number of worthwhile oddities on this stopgap pseudo-document: the uptempo, high-echo, Spector-produced single of ""Tell the Truth,"" a studio jam on the same tune, and King Curtis's ""Teasin',"" featuring God on novelty guitar. Also some less worthwhile oddities, a lot of Cream and Delaney &amp; Bonnie, and not enough showpieces from the Yardbirds and Bluesbreakers days (those are on other labels, which means they cost money). Yet it's gone top ten. Must be a lot of collectors out there. Or maybe just people who believe in God.
"
FALSE,B,The South Coast of Texas,Guy Clark,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4546,"
Clark is hardly the last surviving singer-songwriter, but so much of the competition has gotten into rock auteurism or pop demos that those who miss the old ways pay him more mind than they used to. This is his best since 1975's aptly titled Old No. 1. The ""Rita Ballou"" lets us know he's singing easier, and turns like ""her breath's as sweet as chewing gum"" and ""the road to good intentions/Is paved with the fools that I've been"" remind us of his vernacular knack. But only on ""New Cut Road,"" real bluegrass canonfodder, does the music add meaning as well as tangibility. Which is why the competition is into rock auteurism and pop demos.

Not really live, just cut for subsequent broadcast in the studio with small band rather than countrypolitan arsenal. But that's not really the problem--the problem is what and to a lesser extent when. None of these songs were hits for Patsy even though some of them were released as singles, and though career trajectory is no doubt part of the reason, so is quality of material. And though he was good in 1956, she did get better.

Shit-rock iconographer J.D. King's NYC art band included a guitarist named Thurston Moore, and the halting melodicism of their circa-'79 demos will surprise pioneering Sonic Youth fans, though Thurston was only the guitarist, after all. It also surprises me, because I never heard or heard of them at a time when I was clubbing three-four times weekly. They sure deserved some word-of-mouth. On the other hand, they weren't deeply special, not on this evidence. This is why critics get a little jaded.

Another eccentric Nashville songwriter rides after gold with some famous buddies and winds up with another better-than-average country album. This one features vocals from Merle Haggard (two songs), Willie Whozit (one song), Jack Greene (who sounds like Waylon Whozit), and a dusky-voiced old favorite of mine, Jeannie Seely (Jack's singing partner and Hank's wife). Clinkerless, but way too heavy on the lighthearted throwaways.

FALSE,B,Stealing Fire,Bruce Cockburn,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4556,"
The songs about life and love fade into the usual high-IQ lyricism, but the ones about politics bite and hold. Not just because they're more violent (guns and copters galore) or virtuous (folk-rock Sandinista!)--because they're more specific. It isn't just ideology that makes ""Who put that bullet hole in Peggy's kitchen wall?"" a better lyric than ""Pay attention to the poet/You need him and you know it."" Me, I pay attention to rocket launchers.
"
FALSE,B,World of Wonders,Bruce Cockburn,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4557,"
Cockburn's a very smart guy with as tough and articulate a line on imperialism as any white person with a label deal. Few singer-songwriters play meaner guitar, and as befits an anti-imperialist he knows the international sonic palette. Unfortunately, his records never project musical necessity. The melodies and/or lyrics carry the first side anyway, but though I'm sure Cockburn has some idea what the synthesized pans are doing on the cry of politico-romantic angst and the vaguely Andean fretboards on the Wasp dub poem, what the world will hear is the oppressive boom-boom of four-four drums.

After listening to two LPs worth of ""Singles 1970-1987"" three times, I'm convinced the miracle he's waiting for is one that transmutes a single into a hit. I'm waiting for his benefit compilation for the Committee in Solidarity With the People of El Salvador.

Where other singers have soul, Cockburn has dudgeon, fiercer and bitterer with every record. Delivering lines like ""don't breathe when the cars go by"" and ""may their gene pool increase"" as if his life depended on them, which before he's dead it could, he reveals rules about the ineluctable bad faith of the political for the know-nothing shibboleths they are. Too bad he still cultivates his ""personal"" side. I await a best-of filled with protest and nothing but.

No, his voice isn't shot, though it's certainly lost a lot of soft edges and warm crannies--a lot of phlegm. Partial compensation provided by the decline of L.A.: there are more good songs lying around than at any time since Cocker and Three Dog Night invented interpretive rock way back when. And Sly &amp; Robbie's loud, fast Memphis beat is the toughest backup of his life.

Anybody who doubts the artiness of L.A. punk purism should check out the London version--where NME-subscribing suburbanites speed up the Pistols, East End oi boys slow them down (just slightly, to about the tempo of a fast football march). Sure the songs blur too much anyway, especially on side two, but the 'tween-verse rave-ups are rousing throughout, ""I'm Not a Fool"" is worthy of 1977, the line after ""Join the Rejects"" is ""And get yourself killed,"" and the toaster-introed ""Where the Hell Is Babylon?"" (""I wanna go"") is an overdue answer song whatever its racial subtext--my only regret is that they didn't slip a dig at the Dolls into it.

I can forgive August Darnell the filler on side one because he's a gifted disco producer, which means his throwaway jingles and premature remakes and cynical trifles add up to dance music that's more listenable than most. But the failures on side two are as unfocused as anything he's ever committed to vinyl--excepting only ""If I Only Had a Brain,"" an all too apt cover for these would-be bimbos.

Cohen's arrangements are even more detailed and surprising than John Lissauer's, and Jennifer Warnes is the most valuable backup singer since Emmylou Harris. ""The Traitor"" is a minor masterpiece. And in general this record's take on courtly love in the swingers' era packs more ironic intelligence than you would have thought possible. Or necessary, unfortunately. Cohen's gift for elementary hummables seems to deteriorate as his writing evolves from the conversational toward the allegorical. Irony or no irony, ""rages of fragrance"" and ""rags of remorse"" sound suspiciously like bad poetry even when they're sung, and that's not now it's supposed to work.

FALSE,B,Dear Heather,Leonard Cohen,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12572,"
I know it's hard to get a grip on, kids, but people keep getting older. They don't just reach some inconceivable benchmark--50 or, God, 60--and stop, Old in some absolute sense. The bones, the joints, the genitals, the juices, the delivery systems, and eventually the mind continue to break down, at an unpredictable pace in unpredictable ways. Leonard Cohen has had No Voice since he began recording at 33. But he has more No Voice today, at 70, than he did on Ten New Songs, at 67--the tenderness in his husky whisper of 2001, tenderness the way steak is tender, has dried up in his whispered husk of 2004, rendering his traditional dependence on the female backups who love him more grotesque. Nor does noblesse oblige underlie all the adaptations and settings--Lord Byron, Patti Page, a Quebecois folk song, various dead Canadian poets, himself. Rather they reflect the same diminished inspiration that makes you wonder whether his 9/11 song is enigmatic or merely inconclusive. Not only do I like the guy, I'm Old enough to identify with him. But I doubt I'll ever be Old enough to identify with this. On her deathbed, my 96-year-old mother-in-law was still relying on Willie Nelson's Stardust. That's more like it.

FALSE,B,What's That Noise?,Coldcut,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4566,"
Things work out all too predictably for this smart young studio duo. Eclectically danceable and righteously segued though their samples are, they're too bare-bones in themselves to move the crowd--the world beyond the dance floor. When a real vocalist climbs aboard--Lisa Stansfield, Queen Latifah, Junior Reid (though not, righteous eclecticism aside, Mark E. Smith)--everything is swinging. And when the music is all beat and concept, it's all beat and concept--though ""Party and party and party and bullshit"" is certainly in the great tradition of postmod self-criticism.

FALSE,B,X&Y,Coldplay,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13029,"
Tunewise, this is the craftiest of their well-crafted albums. Conceived as a boy group, showing girls who long to believe it that not every guy is a jock, a thug, a lothario, or a male-bonded mook, they might even have their uses. Conceived as a pop alternative to U2 and Radiohead, however, they're an argument for death metal. Precise, bland, and banal, their sensitivity emotionless and their musicality never surprising, they're the definition of a pleasant bore--easy to tune out, impossible to care for.

FALSE,B,Sine Die,Steve Coleman and Five Elements,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3328,"
Between their groove-busting tempo shifts and putative profundities, Coleman's two earlier records were enough to make you wonder whether smart fusion was any better than the dumb kind. This is definitely an improvement--at its best, it combines the modern tonalities of schooled bebop with the snap and kick of professional funk. Not the bump and thump, though. And while Cassandra Wilson sings more and intones less, she still has to deal with Coleman's lyrics. Which must be why Sting likes the guy.

FALSE,B,Cold Snap,Albert Collins,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=47,"
In which Bruce Iglauer shoots for a Grammy by setting up his big man with a big band--Jimmy McGriff, Mel Brown, Uptown Horns, the works. They do work, too. But nobody ever mistook Albert for Jimmy Witherspoon, much less Jimmy Rushing--he doesn't have the kind of built-in bullhorn essential to that big effect. As if NARAS will care.
"
FALSE,B,Showdown!,Albert Collins/Robert Cray/Johnny Copeland,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=46,"
Collins gets top billing not just because he's Alligator's man but because this is his album. He takes a solo on all nine cuts where Cray and Copeland are vouchsafed a total of seven, and shares vocals about equally with his costars, both of whom cut him. Not that they're trying--if they were, this would live up to its title. As it is, whether the problem's will or conception or ability, you'll get more fireworks from Lonnie Mack w/Stevie Ray Vaughan.

FALSE,B,Lost in the Ozone,Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=624,"
Cody takes the country-rock idea that good old boys form a secret counterculture to bleary new heights. Uprooted bozos who handle fast cars and hot music (or vice versa) a lot better than wimmin and booze, they're half at home in every renegade country tradition, rockabilly and Western swing and white boogie-woogie. But not one of the four vocalists achieves the hippie-redneck synthesis--they all sound like they flee to one subculture when they get kicked out of the other. And the only time the songwriting reaches the outer atmosphere is on ""Seeds and Stems (Again),"" as close to pure hippie as they get.
"
FALSE,B,Caught in the Act,Commodores,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6615,"
For four songs--two hits, ""Slippery When Wet"" and ""The Bump,"" surrounded by ""Wide Open,"" which earns its reprise, and an instrumental called ""I'm Ready"" that's good enough for a theme--they make a case for their funk. I already believed, but the argument is a lot of fun. For the rest of the album they make a case for their soul. I'd be more inclined to believe if they hadn't bothered.

FALSE,B,Heroes,Commodores,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4576,"
With Lionel Richie turning his attentions to inspirational numbers varying the theme ""Got to Be Together,"" with ""Jesus"" joining William King's ""Mighty Spirit"" for the finale, this is an improvement. For one thing, most of the brotherhood anthems--which avoid the gender-specific, actually, with lots of ""people,"" ""folks,"" and ""y'all""--have a somewhat more rousing beat than ""Three Times a Lady."" And on the fond ""Old-Fashion Love"" and the cold-hearted ""Sorry to Say,"" the brothers remind Lionel that this is still supposed to be a funk band.
"
FALSE,B,Anthology,Commodores,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4578,"
As this summation makes clear, they never quite connected as a pioneering funk band because their secret weapon was Lionel Richie, who does not number funk among his natural gifts. Beyond him they're a cut above the Johnson Brothers. Richie will be better off without them. And they'll be worse off yet without him.

FALSE,B,Electric Circus,Common,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11775,"
Sometimes brave men march off into the swamp and get seriously lost, so let's hope Captain ?uestlove and his s?uad remembered the DEET. Vocal flow's not the problem, and set to the beat-smart fusion lite of Like Water for Chocolate, the humanity of the well-meaning poetry would probably outweigh all the forced similes and sentimental lapses. Outfitted in this music, however, Common's pretensions stand up and do jumping jacks. There are pleasurable rhythm elements, and under the circumstances, the Stereolab cameo is kind of an up. But those are parts. The whole is keybs like golden nacho goo, guitar sticking out like chips, please-not-more codas, and everywhere the angelic twaddle of singing swingles doo-doo.

FALSE,B,Ry Cooder,Ry Cooder,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3059,"
According to his own complaints, which may well be warranted, the world's favorite studio bottleneck is also the man from whom Mick and Keith stole ""Let It Bleed."" Now if only he could sing as good as Mick and Keith maybe he'd put his own blues synthesis across. As it stands, Cooder's singing and projection are so flat they recall the folkie fantasy in which the real blues comes from toothless old men on porches--songs by Tommy Tucker and Fats Waller and even Randy Newman (who gets a lot more out of his own narrow pipes) sound as humble as those by Sleepy John Estes and Blind Willie Johnson. Cooder has two folkie virtues, though--he remembers the Depression and he finds wonderful songs. Alfred Reed's ""How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times as These"" is proof of both.
"
FALSE,B,Boomer's Story,Ry Cooder,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3060,"
Enslaved by the tradition of the new, I prefer the Cooder who rediscovers material I never dreamed existed to the Cooder who replicates Sleepy John Estes and Skip James. Especially since one of the Estes songs he's found is of even more dubious interest than Estes's singing style, while the James instrumental is a confusingly airy interlude between his two most gratifying discoveries: ""Boomer's Story"" and ""Crow Black Chicken."" Bonus: Cooder's impression of John Fahey playing ""Dark End of the Street.""
"
FALSE,B,Chicken Skin Music,Ry Cooder,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3063,"
The title refers to a Hawaiian expression closely allied to ""goose bumps,"" which has to be the most modest instance of hubris on record--I mean, does Ry really believe this is gonna make my skin prickle? Folk eclecticism is a nouveau-jug commonplace, after all, even if most nouveau jugheads do lack Ry's imagination and musicianship, not to mention the capital to dab color from Honolulu and San Antonio onto the same LP.

FALSE,B,"Live at the Harlem Square Club, 1963",Sam Cooke,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4582,"
Some people think live albums capture the essence of rock and roll; I don't even think live shows do. That may be why this record, which yea verily doth document a little-noted aspect of Cooke's amazing career, leaves me mostly tepid. But I blame it on headlong show-band arrangements so single-minded they soon undermine what conceptual interest inheres in the transformation of this seminal crossover teen dream into fit fare for the over-twenty-ones in a Miami r&amp;b club. I like grit as much as the next postprimitivist, but good grit admits interpretive flair just like any other mode--more than Cooke puts into these hits, originally designed to downplay his gritty side.

FALSE,B,Billion Dollar Babies,Alice Cooper,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6627,"
The title's as perfect as the band's latest symbol--a $, its ""S"" transformed into a two-headed snake. No outrage Alice has concocted equals the frank, sweaty greed of his current success. Oddly, though, this blatant profit mechanism is his most consistent album--even the song about (mercy me) necrophilia is tolerable, just like the song about tooth decay. But without a ""School's Out"" or an ""I'm Eighteen""--neither ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" nor ""Elected"" quite makes the grade--there's nothing to tempt anyone back to the new improved filler.
"
FALSE,B,Make My Home Where I Hang My Hat,Johnny Copeland,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4586,"
At the outset Copeland identifies himself as a ""Natural Born Believer,"" then applies himself to the bluesman's dilemma of making that belief come just as naturally to us. On his debut album, an all-star horn section and a quarter century of pent-up ambition put him over, but here he opts for the homey (and perhaps overfamiliar) spontaneity of his road band and instead gets horns and songs that sound half-dead until he mixes in some covers overdisc.
"
FALSE,B,Spaces,Larry Coryell,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6631,"
This match-up with Coryell's British counterpart John McLaughlin--featuring a milestone rhythm section of Chick Corea, Miroslav Vitous, and Billy Cobham--spends too much time constructing tone poems for Barney Kessell and nowhere near enough playing new rock and roll. I know Coryell has lightning fingers and a brain to match and in an abstract way I admire him for it, but what's made him more than an improvising technician is a concept that includes the loud and the vulgar. Here even the inevitable raveup sounds willfully thin, as if Charlie Parker had given up saxophone for piccolo because he wanted to be respectable.

FALSE,B,Taking Liberties,Elvis Costello,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4588,"
OK, twenty more songs, all B sides etc., how could it hold together, but some sentimental part of me is taken with its reflexive passion and half-finished serendipity--this detritus was the work of a punk fellow-traveler, and he'll be missed. ""Girls Talk"" and ""Stranger in the House"" and ""I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea"" are more indelible than Get Happy!! at its happiest, and let me put in a word for all 1:43 of the previously unreleased ""Hoover Factory,"" a punless piece of melancholy throwaway sarcasm that reminds us that he's in this because he's pissed, not because he's glib.

FALSE,B,Spike,Elvis Costello,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1161,"
Paul Whiteman was a bigger star, and though my jazz friends may cringe, I doubt he was as good. But like Elvis C., he made the mistake of applying his refined taste to what he knew was the music of the future--hiring fine players, commissioning Ellington and Copland, emphasizing the danceability of an orchestra too grand to be called a band, he honored the classics. Who knows which of Costello's virtues will seem equally irrelevant 40 or 10 years hence--his obsessive wit? his precise arrangements? his respect for musical history? Unless I'm mistaken, though, he's doomed to be remembered as fatally self-conscious. And doomed as well never to convert the unconverted again.

This Stax-based twenty-song loss leader establishes not his fecundity but his fallibility--lotsa duds. I count maybe eight originals I'll remember half as well as the Sam &amp; Dave obscurity, and n.b.: the Sam &amp; Dave obscurity was the hit (U.K. hit, of course I mean). His rueful disavowal of ""Knock on Wood"" (in a dud) is no less impressive than his proud claim on ""Time Is Tight"" (in a keeper), and tropes and hooks abound--why deny lines like ""You lack lust you're so lackluster"" or ""I speak double dutch to a real double duchess""? On the other hand, why bother digging them out?

The breakthrough fluke of the year has it all over his predecessors in REO Speedwagon--Bob Seger, Cougar's current role model, has been dreaming of riffs with this much melodic crunch ever since Night Moves, and when I don't think about whys and wherefores they satisfy my mainstream cravings. But the guy is a phony on the face of it, and not in a fun way--anybody with the gall to tell teen America that once you pass sixteen ""the thrill of living is gone"" has been slogging toward stardom for so long he never noticed what happened to Shaun Cassidy.

FALSE,B,Funk Pump,The Counts,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6639,"
I feared the worst when I realized the lead cut was Carole King's ""Jazzman,"" the worst being that they'd gotten ""better."" More vocals, more horns, more pop moves, and when the female chorus sings ""This ain't a song it's just a magic ride"" you can be sure it ain't a magic ride either. The title cut is built like a fire hydrant, and I enjoy side two until ""Tecalli,"" where their Latin accent gets suave. But jazzmen they're not.

""We Want Mine,"" a jarring little rocker about Third World deprivation, and ""Animal Skins,"" which quotes George Harrison as it salvages every religious leader who's ever lived, convinced me for a while that the rest of this systematically disjoint music flowed and crackled appropriately. But for the most part the melodies of these art-pop set pieces don't live up to the harmonies; their premeditated shifts recall late Beatles when they work and middle Uriah Heep when they don't. I still prefer songs about Mounties to songs about centaurs. But I also prefer Mountie songs that keep galloping when the lyrical conceit gets boring, which it does.

After setting the mood with two obscure sureshots from the Pebbles anthology (why wasn't ""Green Fuz"" a hit?), En Why's own mock rockabillies come up with an actual novelty album instead of a theoretical one.

Hailed by the ever tightening knot of blues loyalists as the next . . . Son Seals?, Cray can recite his catechism without kowtowing to orthodoxy--guitar like Albert Collins only chillier and more staccato, voice like B.B. King only cleaner and, well, thinner. Willie Dixon and Howlin' Wolf songs lead for good reason, but both artist and producers write with uncommon acidity (try ""Nice as a Fool Can Be"" and ""The Score"" respectively) and country-soul cult hero O.V. Wright adds the right kind of historical perspective. A little more vocal muscle and he might compete with . . . Son Seals.

Though Beefheart-FFKT drummer John French, Dixie Dregs bassist Andy West, and hockey-mad Swedish avant-rocker Michael Maksymenko get equal billing, this is Henry Kaiser's pickup project--you can tell because he's on every cut. Concept is Beefheart as Dixie Dregs, kind of, with intermittent lyrics, not always in English. You'll go for Maksymenko singing ZZ Top in Russian, and Kaiser-West-Maksymenko rocking Albert Ayler. Both covers, you notice. I never did get Dixie Dregs.

FALSE,B,Mardi Gras,Creedence Clearwater Revival,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6649,"
For a while I forgot my John Fogerty fixation and enjoyed side two of this country-rock debut, which is what asking Stu Cook and Doug Clifford to sing and compose transforms the seventh Creedence album into. But facts are facts. Only ""Sweet Hitch-Hiker,"" an original as unambitious as the equally effecting cover of ""Hello Mary Lou,"" could stand on any of Creedence's great albums. ""Lookin' for a Reason"" and ""Someday Never Comes"" may be major songs, but it's hard to tell from the way Fogerty sings them. And only inspired Fogerty vocals might save C&amp;C's competent-plus to competent-minus filler from a lifetime in Lodi.

No devotee of live albums by anybody, much less by guys who come out and recreate their studio renditions of songs and choogles conceived in Lodi, I do hereby certify that this one, said to be a newly discovered 1970 tape, is tighter and more explosive than the flaccid Live in Europe double of their breakup's afterglow. I also acknowledge that after three or four years with bands who want nothing so much as to finance studio renditions of songs and explosions conceived in lower Manhattan, I've learned to enjoy the form. Just make sure you get the studio renditions first.

Work too long toward a future that never arrives and you lose your hold on what comes naturally. Where once he soared, now he drags, and don't blame Don Dixon, whose hitbound modesty and popful soul match Marshall's fine. When your strongest song is about how nobody understands you, you're crying out for a spiritual lift no producer can provide.

For classicists, these guys are certainly undiscriminating--they prefer critical exuberance to critical intellect, which may be why some critics go overboard for them. Jimmie Rodgers yodel meets slide-cum-pedal-steel meets pop chorale meets folk segues, and though the originals don't match the oldies, the oldies are ""House of Blue Lights"" and ""Let the Four Winds Blow.""

FALSE,B,The Best of the Crusaders,The Crusaders,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6663,"
""A group for all seasons and all tastes,"" annotator Don Heckman proclaims, and given ""Chain Reaction"" and ""Soul Caravan"" and most of side one--especially the irresistible ""Put It Where You Want It""--I guess that includes me. I resent it, though. Better Wilton Felder honking his horn and Stix Hooper laying into that beat than Tom Scott and friend, but if this is El Lay's idea of the hard stuff may Booker T. preserve us. Their basic project is soulful Muzak, Muzak with charms to soothe the complacent humanist, and there are hundreds of harder hard bop and funkier funk albums. Try Lee Morgan's Cornbread or James Brown's Sex Machine.

FALSE,B,Good Things,Culture,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4612,"
After a 10-year layoff they have a right to simultaneous albums, but not simultaneous genre exercises. The overriding theme befits the layoff--they feel beset by all these kids who have strayed from the right path. ""Cousin Rude Boy"" and ""Youthman Move"" are fearful and imploring, so alienated that they're a tad less ordinary than you'd figure, while the title tune is positively avuncular--in one of the most unmillenarian sentiments ever uttered by a Rasta, it urges youth to enjoy electric lights and fax machines while they're still around. ""Psalm of Bob Marley"" has a great tune.

A lot of new English bands I wish were even worse than they are--every time Haircut 100 or Depeche Mode finds a riff or a groove it means they may last longer than the fifteen months allotted by the march of fashion. This new English band I wish were better, because for all their fashionability I think their hearts are in the right place--they look so weird because that's the way they feel. They do come up with catchy tunes, too. But their bland Caribbean rhythms move no muscles, and their confrontations with racial issues are rarely more than a phrase deep.

Since I had even less use for the dismissive because-he-wears-dresses theory than for the ridiculous new-Smokey analysis, I could never figure out this cutie-pie's means of commercial propulsion, but I know why he's having trouble staying up there: because he wears dresses. Given the discernible leftward shift in his soft focus, led by a catchy, censored single, this calls for concerted protest--which might be easier to whip up if the latest album weren't part three of more-of-the-same.

""Stand Tall"" was a deserving hit that generated a great follow-up: ""I'm Scared,"" the uncommitted prayer for faith of a skeptic who knows the religious tensions of a materialistic epoch firsthand. But when a slickie like Cummings turns rock crooner, credibility is a continuing problem, and while everything else on this honestly crafted solo debut is passable or better, the only other cut I'd call convincing is a big-band mock-up of former small-bandmate Randy Bachman.

In the wiggy abstraction of his self-regard, Robert Smith has evolved into a Brit art-pop archetype. Eccentric though his songs are, they offer nothing arresting in the way of imagery (""like a baby screams"" and ""it's so smooth it even feels like skin,"" which latter is admittedly pretty good, are as meaty as it gets), much less character or incident. They're not really observed--it's more like they're experienced at a distance. Yet they're not dreamlike, though while he's at it he does report on his dreams--it's more like he doesn't know the difference between loneliness, solipsism, and satori, with lots of stuff about loved ones (girlfriends, I mean) who one way or another aren't there, or real, or something. His characteristic vocal technique is the unacknowledged sob. Yet his music, which on this album runs from New Order rip and electrodisco pseudo-strings to guitar sounds and many lands, isn't rendered any more normal by its exceedingly skillful deployment. And his originality is winning--he's clearly not just intelligent but hyperaware, at home in his alienation, and hence hero, even sex symbol, to a generation. Or at least its arty, collegiate market share.

Samey samey samey is the strategy--repeat repeat repeat repeat the same four-bar theme for sixteen, twenty-four, forty-eight, sixty-four bars before Robert Smith starts to whine, wail, warble, work. Because Smith hasn't veered this far pop since he was a boy, most of the themes stick with you, and in a few cases--my pick is ""Just Like Heaven,"" which gets off to a relatively quick start--his romantic vagaries have universal potential. But especially over a double album, the strategy gets pretty tedious unless Smith happens to be whining, wailing, warbling, or working to you.

In which a rangy baritone with a patch over one eye regales thousands of truckers with their own mythology. Sociologists will note that his rebel persona embraces lots of sex and several blues.

When you hum this music you hum Steve Scipio's bass lines--not the vocals, and not the guitar parts of Scipio's cocomposer Patrick Patterson. Which says something for the abiding flexibility that always makes it comfortable to listen to. But also helps explain why it's rarely anything more.

""Uneasy Rider"" is still perfect--a tall tale of a new outlaw, peace-loving but not a damn fool about it, grabbing a redneck by the symbolic short hair. But a year later ""The South's Gonna Do It"" sang the praises of long-haired rednecks, and he never looked back. A safer tall tale, the predictable ""Devil Went Down to Georgia,"" put him back on the singles charts in 1979, and in 1980 the Russkie-baiting ""America"" proved what the self-reliant individualism of ""Long Haired Country Boy"" was good for. Already pushing fifty, he's just a Southerner of a certain generation. Sometimes he's a lot of fun. If he sang as good as Merle Haggard we might even forgive his jingoism.

A stronger album than I'd expect from the Band at this moment in history. Danko's solo debut includes a more sharply conceived city song than Robbie Robertson has ever come up with and a more sharply conceived coffee song than . . . well, the category is admittedly less extensive.

And I thought Bitches Brew was unfocused. Well, it was--and it was also pretty great. This is more unfocused, and not great. Comprising four (apparently unedited) twenty-five-minute swatches entitled ""Wednesday Miles,"" ""Thursday Miles,"" etc., it noodles unforgivably--the electric keyboards of Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett on Wednesday provide one of the most aimless patches. Every side does offer at least one treasures--the cool atmospherics that lead off Wednesday, the hard bop in extremis toward the end of Thursday, the way Miles blows sharply lyrical over Jack DeJohnette's rock march and Airto Moreira's jungle sci-fi for the last few minutes of Friday, all the activity surrounding Steve Grossman's solo on Saturday. Just wish the damn records were banded.

Davis has been putting out moderately enjoyable records for as long as I kept track. This is a little less folky, worth investigating for non-charismatic, professional rock and roll.

FALSE,B,Tyrone Davis' Greatest Hits,Tyrone Davis,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6685,"
I'd be less inclined to quibble about this sixteen-song selection if the three-plus years it spans were long enough for one small factory to come up with sixteen go-rillas in a medium tempo, which is the only one Davis knows. But though there's classic stuff here, only Davis's gamely anachronistic soul style--blues crooning with touches of grit, like a less sharply defined Bobby Bland or a softer Little Milton--provides interest most of the time. And too often Willie Henderson's horns (not to mention his strings) make you yawn anyway.

FALSE,B,Love at 1st Sight,Peter Dayton,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4627,"
On the B, former La Peste vocalist Dayton and aspiring producer Ric Ocasek combine for an OK title tune and a sub-OK instrumental. On the A, they concoct the Cars-sexy ""Skintite"" and the Velvets-catchy ""Stuck on the Same Refrain."" Which I'm stuck on.

FALSE,B,The Sound of Music,The dB's,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3565,"
Yeah it rocks, but when a pop group leaves it at that they're no better than their latest song, and when their sole remaining songwriter is still dissecting serial monogamy as he says bye to thirty, chances are his latest song doesn't even interest him all that much. With Chris Stamey they really had a sound. And with Chris Butler they really had a groove.

Proving that not all black rock-and-rollers have forgotten Chuck Berry, or maybe that not all black musicians have forgotten rock and roll, young Fats shouts out his claim. Maybe ""Stagger Lee"" is the only completely convincing song on the record, but how many rock-and-rollers can do Stack convincingly any more?

FALSE,B,Young Loud and Snotty,Dead Boys,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=984,"
Despite Stiv Bators's mewl, which can get almost as annoying as Geddy Lee's falsetto, this is mostly well-crafted junk, tough and tuneful and in one case--the definitively deafening ""Sonic Reducer""--positively anthemic. But the charm of good junk has always been its innocence, and if these fellows are innocent they're pretty perverse about it--emotional incompetents out of their depth. Alternate title (stolen from Mary Harron): Take My Life--Please.

FALSE,B,El DeBarge,El DeBarge,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4634,"
Especially since Eldra, to honor the name his mama gave him, has shown something like genius as both writer and producer, the plethora of outside help is a double down. But though you can be sure this projected crossover is expected to produce a run of peppy crossover singles, starting with El's second straight meaningless movie theme, it has the flow of an album, even the personal stamp. This is provided not by what they're selling, the boyish clarity and indomitable sweetness of a voice a just God would have bestowed on a braver guy, but by the outside help, most of it sufficiently skillful and second-rate to mimic his rhythmic and melodic quirks. With lyrics adding hints of maturity to his customary show of naivet������������������ and hooky beats fattened with the plush keybs of big-league pop, he "

""Smoke on the Water"" is about a big fire in Montreux, obviously the most exciting thing to happen to these fellows since the London Symphony Orchestra. No jokes about who's getting burned, though--I approve of their speeding, and Ritchie Blackmore has copped some self-discipline as well as a few suspicious-sounding licks from his buddies in London. Personal to Paul Kantner: Check out ""Space Truckin'.""

FALSE,B,Deepest Purple: The Very Best of Deep Purple,Deep Purple,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4637,"
Cut the shit, keep them away from large auditoria, and what you end up with is surprisingly kick-ass: lifting one or two songs from half a dozen albums that have only pushy organist Jon Lord and dum-dum drummer Ian Paice in common, this rocks. With the predictable exceptions--solo here, bridge there, Lord's conservatory application ""Child in Time"" throughout--it's barely even pretentious. ""Black Night"" and ""Woman From Tokyo"" and of course ""Highway Star"" are as worthy of Nuggets as anything the Stangeloves ever recorded.

FALSE,B,New Beginnings,The Dells,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6693,"
Hard to get too interested in virtuoso harmonies expended on mediocre material, and like most vocal-group LPs, this is slow going at times. But it ends up quite impressive. Instead of resigning themselves to the oldies circuit--four of the five Dells have been together for twenty-five years, so they sure qualify--they've sought out new songs from a variety of sources, including two George Clinton-produced Parliaments classics. Wish they didn't figure it was modern to put only four on a side, though.

FALSE,B,Jackie,Jackie DeShannon,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6700,"
About once a year, Jerry Wexler tries to bring a fundamentally soulful white female pop singer up to the minute. Sometimes it works (Dusty in Memphis, the all-time rock-era torch record), sometimes it doesn't (Cher, Lulu). This one almost works, not because DeShannon is such a terrific singer--although she's a lot more terrific with Wexler and friends pushing her from the bottom--but because for the first time in a while she's written a few terrific songs. Nothing wrong with her up-to-the-minute country-soul covers of Van Morrison, Neil Young, and their lessers, and nothing just right either. When she launches into her own ""Vanilla 'Olay"" or ""Anna Karina,"" though, she sounds like time is on her side.

The title tune is pure dance groove, quite distinctive: I'd compare it to a locomotive, only it's smoother, maybe a diesel. The other good stuff is less distinctive: after the ""you make me wanna moan"" bit I would have sworn my man Al had indulged in a little label-jumping, but the real culprit is probably coproducer W. Mitchell.

You probably wouldn't play this one again except for ""Whatcha Gonna Wear Tomorrow,"" but you do, and it grows on you, and you hum it sometimes, so you play it some more, and then you get tired of it and put it away and don't expect you'll ever play it again.

This singing (and writing) sewer designer scored three anachronistically soulish hits in 1974, then dropped from sight. Here he resurfaces with an anachronistically soulish (and anachronistically disco-ish) ""new version"" of his biggie, ""Be Thankful for What You've Got."" And covers ""You Send Me"" as Curtis Mayfield might were Curtis still so deep. And writes some more.

Filler plus three major songs, each of which gets an explanatory video in concert, which with these art-school ciphers is a comfort. In ""Through Being Cool,"" a sexually and racially integrated platoon of ""young alien types"" do in fact ""eliminate the ninnies and the twits,"" though rather than the bone-crunching tactics the lyric prescribes they utilize a ray gun that reduces two discoids to a Clyfford Still blur, transforms three joggers into old people, and blows two old people away. In ""Love Without Anger"" two humans in chicken suits bill and coo after fighting over pecking order. And in ""Beautiful World"" the mild closing disclaimer ""But not for me"" is amplified by a panoply of newsreel horrors. None of which will satisfy the ninnies and twits who think war toys and visual aids are evil by definition.

Perhaps it will clear something up to specify that this is not a soul record. It is a weird record. Never have soul horns sounded remotely as sour, and Kevin Rowland can't carry a tune to the next note. There are horn interjections that make me laugh out loud at their perfectly timed wrong rightness, and with Kevin Rowland quavering through his deeply felt poesy and everybody else blaring away, I enjoy it in much the same way I enjoy a no-wave band on a good night--DNA, say. But DNA I understand.

FALSE,B,Manifest Destiny,The Dictators,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6713,"
Their offensiveness is typified quite nicely by their name and the name of their album--anyone smart enough to fool around with such terminology ought to be decent enough not to. Their excuse is that their galumphing beat, their ripped-off hooks, and their burlesqued melodrama are funnier than ever, and I admit that after dozens of playings I like this almost as much as I did their first. But I liked their first instantly, which is the way dumb jokes should work, and anyway, no one has answered my big question: do they play their own instruments?

FALSE,B,Green Mind,Dinosaur Jr.,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1034,"
J Mascis is a one-trick guitar god whose act gets sloppier and samier as his adolescence becomes more figurative. He does have his own instrumental sound, a roiling whine that's the essence of grunge on pot. Unfortunately, he also has his own vocal sound, ditto. Grunge's pothead contingent will adore him until he succumbs to male-pattern baldness. But someday, archaeologists will wonder just exactly what was the point. I wonder now.
"
FALSE,B,Dire Straits,Dire Straits,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6719,"
Despite initial misgivings, I've found this thoughtful and sexy. The decisive touch is how Mark Knopfler counterpoints his own vocals on guitar--only a musician with a real structural knack could sound like two people that way. But there's a streak of philistine ideology here that speaks for too many white r&amp;b players these days--most of them can't be bothered articulating it, that's all. In ""In the Gallery,"" an honest sculptor has his bareback rider, coal miner, and skating ballerina rejected by the ""trendy boys,"" ""phonies,"" and ""fakes"" who (literally) conspire together and ""decide who gets the breaks."" Those who find this rather simplistic should now ask themselves whether Knopfler's beloved Sultans of Swing--not to mention Dire Straits--have more in common with that sculptor than he suspects.

FALSE,B,My Feet Can't Fail Me Now,The Dirty Dozen Brass Band,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4669,"
I may never get over early reports describing this New Orleans neotrad octet as ""funky,"" which I took to mean that in addition to integrating Monk and Bird tunes into marching-band polyphony they had a bottom like James Brown or at least the Meters. After one listen, I realized what I already knew--that to get a funk beat out of tuba, bass, drum, and snares isn't difficult, it's impossible. Maybe the big deal is that they're not only fun in a mild, neotrad way, but also what Dr. John used to call ""fonky""--that even though they play jazz, people dance to it. A not inconsiderable conceptual triumph, but those who dance a lot anyway are unlikely to appreciate it. Upped a notch for integrating Monk and Bird tunes into marching-band polyphony.

The cameos--by Dr. John, Dizzy Gillespie, and Branford Marsalis--are the giveaways, because this jaunty concept needs those guys, to sing or solo as the case may be. The headliners are the lounge band of a tourist's dreams, and that's all they are. Why in the world cover Stevie Wonder's message-laden ""Don't Drive Drunk"" as an instrumental (polyphonic, mais oui)? Because it's a deathless piece of music? To prove how up-to-date you are? Or to stump the clientele in a game of name-that-tune?

Clear, tuneful, hard-driving, this is one of those records that jumps you so good you may never think to wonder why they bothered. I did, however--occupational hazard, you know. Except for ""Take Your Life,"" boyishly power-pop yet precisely as murderous as its title, I figure it must have something to do with the love of rock and roll.

With Mike Chapman the hooker, Christina Amphlett enters the race for Miss Bad Girl of 1986 and is fairly depressing for side one. After dumping a bucket of water on her head, she starts to play rough overdisc, but it's too late.

This is the genderfucked Sweet that Mike Chapman should have gotten out of Christina Amphlett last time, before Vic Maile and Girlschool beat them to it, but as with straight Sweet, the tunes pound by a little too evenly to change the world. ""Dirty Love"" will never besmirch CHR, and unless she gets lucky with ""Hey Little Boy,"" a genderfucked cover the world's been waiting for since 1966, it could be three-strikes-she's-out for a dirt-eater who deserves better.

FALSE,B,I Am the Blues,Willie Dixon,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6723,"
Dixon is the first important blues composer since the classic era who isn't also an important singer. Between songwriting royalties and production income, he doesn't have to perform much--which may be why his records are so undistinguished. It's not that Dixon doesn't have a ""good voice""--is it ever? But he's never developed his expressive potential. The material is classic, and the backing by an anonymous ""hand-picked crew of Chicago blues veterans"" adds personality (is that Otis Spann?), but this document is for collectors only.

For three cuts it doesn't matter that he says nothing fast--not only is the music funky (his favorite word), it's clever, multileveled, gut-wrenching, ear-opening. Add the raucous Michel'le cameo ""Comm. Blues"" and you begin to think he deserves his best-seller, message or no message. And then, zip. Except on the tongue-twisting ""Portrait of a Master Piece,"" the funk straightens out so abruptly you soon wonder what he's got to say. The less the better, as it turns out--guess who's ""Beautiful but Deadly.""

"
FALSE,B,Malpractice,Dr. Feelgood,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1092,"
As with so much pub-rock, this never quite gets out of the pub. The funk quotient of bands like this one is invaluable, and their U.S. bid does offer several memorable originals (""Another Man"" and ""Don't Let Your Daddy Know"") and worthy remakes (""I Can Tell"" and ""Riot in Cell Block #9""). But then there's all the OK stuff--side two is a B side indeed, if not C plus. And I can't help wondering whether a debut album that sounds like a stylized J. Geils Band doesn't portend death by secondhand mechanization.

FALSE,B,King Buffalo,The Doctor's Children,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4681,"
Like so many Brits (and Yanks), they think they've got a new wrinkle on ""American rock,"" and with bespectacled Peter Perrett soundalike Paul Smith writing and singing and playing, they manage one: chaotic feedback and organ murk subsumed in the soaring Byrdsy-Velvetsy ebb and flow. But I wouldn't say they ""return it [`American rock'] with a looping back-spin,"" though that's hardly a momentous claim. And so it goes in the realm of better-than-average guitar bands.

""Behind the myth lies the effort of the rhythm [rythm?],"" she muses in re racial relations. But the effort of the rhythm is in the preparation and production, not necessarily the final product.

Though this sums up their brush with greatness, a/k/a Michael McDonald, McDonald has grasped greatness but once: on the eternally recurrent apothegm ""What a Fool Believes,"" here isolated overdisc from such grazes, whisks, and sweeps as ""Here to Love You,"" ""Real Love,"" and ""Minute by Minute."" Vanity, vanity--usefulness rather than greatness is the purview of a record like this, and thus the first volume stands as a more fetching collection of ephemera. Better than Minute by Minute and One Step Closer on the sociological ground that it got more total airplay.

Strong performances and audio.

Not counting the live double (from which this inexplicably includes ""Who Do You Love"") and the two non-Morrison albums (from which this explicably includes nothing) the Doors recorded six LPs.

Conventional exercises on side one: liberal protests (""Wasted Country"") and reflective love songs (""If Only You""). But from the literal title tune to the Beethoven-drenched romantic climax, side two is the yuppie blues, its killer the literal ""No Time,"" about how busy she is. Pet Shop Boys, this is how it sounds with soul.

Sounds like better Motown than recently and greasier Motown than ever, and it figures--this Tempts-styled Detroit quintet, with Ron Banks in the David Ruffin role, play for the Memphis Grease Kings. ""Get Up and Get Down"" and ""Watcha See Is Whatcha Get"" resound with uptempo bottom, and while I find the big dramatic number, ""In the Rain,"" a little too big and too dramatic, I do prefer Don Davis's sound effects to Norman Whitfield's. Better filler than Motown, too--but not that much better.

Dury's idiomatic literacy is a continuing pleasure, but only on ""Quiet"" (to his kids) and maybe ""This Is What We Find"" (comedic-philosophical) is it enough, because the music tries too bleeding hard to be ingratiating. The man is supposed to be too English for us colonials, but I feel a lot more at home with the musichall rock of New Boots and Panties!! than with the fusoid pop internationalism of Chaz Jankel's arrangements here--jazz per Ramsey Lewis, reggae per Byron Lee, disco per Arthur Murray.

Hitch Mick Taylor to a locomotive, make sure the songs are twenty years old, and you could get shit. But you could also get a decent live album if the auteur happened to be interested that night. ""Maggie's Farm"" and ""Tombstone Blues"" are the keepers, ""License to Kill"" and the ludicrous white reggae ""I and I"" are the ringers, and ""Tangled Up in Blue"" gets some new lyrics--or maybe they're really old ones.

Automatic horns and Dylanettes echoing every chorus, covers and collaborations--sounds like something he threw together in a week and away forever. But throwing it away is how he gets that off-the-cuff feel, and side two is great fun. Tough rocker with Tom Petty, lissome popper with Carole Bayer Sager, and with Sam Shepard one of the greatest and most ridiculous of his great ridiculous epics. Doesn't matter who came up with such lines as ""She said even the swap meets around here are getting corrupt"" and ""I didn't know whether to duck or run, so I ran""--they're classic Dylan. And on side one we have automatic horns and Dylanettes echoing every chorus, covers and songs he wrote all by himself.

His seventh studio job of the decade is the third he didn't just churn out and thus the third to get hyped as a turnaround, but really, there is a difference. Daniel Lanois's understated care and easy beat suit his casual ways, and three or four songs might sound like something late at night on the radio, or after the great flood. All are modest and tuneful enough to make you forgive ""Disease of Conceit,"" which is neither. So I forgive him.

The lead signer on one of the best Motown albums in years is a mascara-eyed, effeminate--gay--falsetto named Tony Washington. His devotion to group tradition has inspired Ashford &amp; Simpson to write a more melodic bunch of songs than they've managed for any of their own albums yet.

Joining her playmates' games of can-you-top-this with a ringleader's enthusiasm, she gives full rein to her imagination, such as it is.

These guys certainly boogie more than the bluegrass sellouts who populate the vaguely country-oriented mainstream of contemporary American rock, and they certainly write more memorable songs. But this culminates the reactionary individualism that country-rock has come to epitomize in the counterculture. What's worse, the country orientation bespeaks not roots but a lack of them, so that in the end the product is suave and synthetic--brilliant, but false. And not always all that brilliant, either.

Hum 'em high--ten poptunes from the Four Lads of I'm-okay I'm-okay are probably a must for those who've concluded they're geniuses by listening to the radio. I happen to remember that what makes On the Border a decent album isn't their ""victory song"" (over guess what kind of person) but the songs to, about, and by other men, and that the only other decent cut on last year's breakthrough was the one that told a hard truth about the artists.

Speaking strictly as a nonfan, I'd grant that this is their most substantial if not their most enjoyable LP--they couldn't have written any of the songs on side one, or even the pretentious and condescending ""The Last Resort,"" without caring about their California theme down deep. But though one strength of these lyrics is that they don't exclude the Eagles from purgatory-on-earth, Don Henley is incapable of conveying a mental state as complex as self-criticism--he'll probably sound smug croaking out his famous last words (""Where's the Coke?""). I'd also be curious to know what Mexican-Americans think of the title tune's Spanish accent.

Though they're nowhere near as lame as the artist claims (what do artists know? and why should they tell us about it?), these occasionally surprising studies in neotraditionalist rockabilly do lack that crucial aura of authority--the walking bass sounds more committed than the callow abandon when it should be the other way round. Still, side one won't disillusion, and two strokes shouldn't get lost on the B: the supernal male narcissism of ""My Baby Worships Me,"" and ""Devil's Right Hand,"" a ban-handguns parable you'd swear is as old as the Louvin Brothers.

This time, it isn't only the heavy beat, loud guitars, and wild-ass vocal mannerisms that make it rock--giveaway's the melodrama that rock set pieces substitute for the flat inevitability of the country variety. So my prescription is simple: more Tom T., less Bruce. Meanwhile, just say his vision of history is more convincing than his vision of personal relations. Which these days is another giveaway.

FALSE,B,Exit 0,Steve Earle & the Dukes,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4711,"
Last time you knew he was a rock-and-roller because he was a soulful wiseass, full of piss, vinegar, and super unleaded. This time you know he's a rock-and-roller because he puts his band's name on the slug line. Whether Nashville has a contract out on him or he harbors a secret desire to become a folksinger, his will to boogie gets mired down in the lugubrious fatalism that so often passes for seriousness among self-conscious Americans. Maybe the problem with country boys who are smart enough to write their own lyrics is that they're also smart enough to read their own reviews.

The three live sides reflect their genuine jazz orientation, flowing along enjoyably and unexcessively and offering more new material than is superstar practice. But orientation ain't chops, and despite my prejudices I'd rather hear Dvorak's New World Symphony than the Whites'. The four songs on the studio side are enjoyable, too--took them a while to figure out their formula, but now they've really got it down.

EW&amp;F are the real black MOR, equivalent in their catchy way to the oh-so-expert Carpenters, though of course they're much better because they're black--that is, because the post-Sly and harmony-group usages they've had to master are so rich and resilient. Most of these songs are fun to listen to. But they're still MOR--the only risk they take is running headlong into somebody coming down the middle of the road in the opposite direction. Like the Carpenters.
"
FALSE,B,I Am,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10810,"
Sexy, dancey pop music of undeniable craft, and it doesn't let up. But as we all know, they could be doing a lot better.
"
FALSE,B,Electric Universe,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4715,"
Careerist ebb-and-flow notwithstanding, I'm tempted to blame the letdown on the return of Philip Bailey, whose falsetto spirituality might well have disoriented what's turned into a great pop show band. Especially if his own attempted breakthrough as a pop solo is any example.
"
FALSE,B,Contenders,Easterhouse,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4716,"
Like so many leftist ideologues before them, they make promises they can't keep. ""Out on Your Own"" opens side one by calling the Red Wedge's bluff, ""Get Back to Russia"" opens side two with praise of Leningrad in spring, and then it's mostly uniform arena-jangle.
"
FALSE,B,Crocodiles,Echo and the Bunnymen,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4719,"
If anything might convince me that the term ""psychedelic revival"" means something it's ""Villiers Terrace,"" a real good terror-of-drugs song. And the music flows tunefully, in a vacant, hard-rock sort of way. But oh, Jimbo, can this really be the end--to be stuck inside of Frisco with the Liverpool blues again?
"
FALSE,B,Making Dick Dance,Ed Gein's Car,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4723,"
Like any hardcore band with the money, they include a lyric sheet. Unlike most, they don't need one--their work is admirably recognizable, words and music both. Which doesn't make it admirable. You can be sure these guys don't shoot ""screwdriver boys""--that's Bernie Goetz. And they don't ""beat up gays""--that's their dog. They're not steamed because they're ""feeding legions of wogs""--that's some middle-aged protofascist. They wouldn't rape anybody--that's the ""sick fucker"" who's on the street because ""the courts don't care."" But they do ""want to fuck a girl like you."" Funny fellows. Docked a notch for their taste in personas.
"
FALSE,B,"God Bless You, Dr. Woodward",Edison Electric Band,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6774,"
This Philadelphia group has been ignored just about everywhere but in Rolling Stone, where they were panned stupidly, perhaps out of geographical jealousy. All the players have the kind of blues-soul feeling that makes Nick Gravenites such a Bay Area hero, and in the best ballroom tradition the music occupies that uncharted region triangulated by rock, pop, and jazz--only it's tighter and more melodic than what you hear in the ballrooms.
"
FALSE,B,Subtle as a Flying Mallet,Dave Edmunds,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=937,"
Only an Englishman would spend a whole album proving he had great taste in rock and roll. And he does, he does--from cock-strut to girl-group I love every one-man-Spector production. I just don't know why he took the trouble.
"
FALSE,B,Twangin,Dave Edmunds,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=942,"
With Nick Lowe butting out, Edmunds wheels into his leather-boy fantasy with all the delicacy of a Harley 1000 on diesel fuel. He digs a thirteen-year-old version of ""Baby Let's Play House"" out of the basement, ignores Guy Mitchell's whistled hook on ""Singing the Blues,"" and acts as if George Jones left something out of ""The Race Is On."" Topper: Lowe-Carter-Edmunds's ""Living Again If It Kills Me,"" which happens to be a slow one.
"
FALSE,B,Life Love and Living,John Edwards,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6775,"
Soul lives, and so does David Porter--you remember, Isaac Hayes and David Porter, Sam &amp; Dave's producers? Porter's new kid crosses Al Green and Sam Cooke as if honoring a deathbed request by his mama, Porter Inc. provides a very consistent bunch of songs, and Muscle Shoals and Malaco style the music. But only God can make a hit.
"
FALSE,B,Live at Reggae Sunsplash,Eek-a-Mouse/Michigan & Smiley,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4725,"
Michigan &amp; Smiley are the Statler Brothers of toasting, but this 1982 performance is where the mighty Mouse transcended the novelty pigeonhole. His delight in the comic highs and lows of his range and the syllabic adaptability of his tongue and palate are even more vivid live than in the studio, and two of the songs here, including the quietly devastating ""Neutron Bomb,"" aren't on any of his five other U.S.-release albums.
"
FALSE,B,Electro-Shock Blues,The Eels,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3591,"
Mark Everett is a talented 31-year-old who bravely determined to deal with the dying he's seen in song. But that didn't mean he had to make a concept album. Beyond art-rock fashion, which has rendered the static song cycle stupid fresh again, the strategy suits a detachment he'd be drawn to in any era, a detachment that's devoid of charm--which also goes for the concept it hides behind, baggage doubly distracting for consumers without a press kit. I count three excellent songs--a plighted troth, a teen memory, and an unexpected flight in which Everett invites one of his deceased back for a last look. I sincerely hope they're all covered by singers who can show them the love they deserve.
"
FALSE,B,The Embarrassment EP,The Embarrassment,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4734,"
From exotic Wichita, with a gift for hookily hypnotic guitar lines that need a haircut. The big name at ""Celebrity Art Party"" is Art Carney, so they also have a gift for the off-rhyme. The rest is harder to remember.
"
FALSE,B,Flowers,The Emotions,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6788,"
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's girl group--literally. Whether it's Jeanette, Sheila, or Wanda who sounds like Diana Ross at a higher level of consciousness, the effect is exquisite. And their romantic platitudes are no worse than EW&amp;F's universalist ones. Which is pretty bad.
"
FALSE,B,Music for Airports,Brian Eno,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=447,"
Although I'm no frequenter of airports, I've found that these four swatches of modestly ""ambient"" minimalism have real charms as general-purpose calmatives. But I must also report that they've fared unevenly against specific backgrounds: sex (neutral to arid), baseball (pleasant, otiose), dinner at my parents' (conversation piece), abstract writing (useful but less analgesic than Discreet Music or my David Behrman record). Also, I'm still waiting for ""1/1"" to resolve the ""Three Blind Mice"" theme.
"
FALSE,B,Apollo: Atmospherics & Soundtracks,Brian Eno,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=450,"
Designed to help a moonshot documentary ""present a set of moods,"" this is ambient Eno at its most accessible--often very pretty, and not without guitar. Still, I expect mood music to sustain a mood, and while as you might expect none of this is unlistenable, some of it is very nearly inaudible, which can be almost as annoying. Left to itself, ""Drift"" does just that, and ""Stars"" and ""Under Stars"" sound like sleep sequences.
"
FALSE,B,Smash Your Head Against the Wall,John Entwistle,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6790,"
Entwistle is an important source of the fucked-up Calvinism that has always added that peculiar note of constraint to the Who--just remember where Peter Townshend turned when he needed a song about Uncle Ernie. These paeans of resentment and frustration climax thematically in songs called ""Heaven and Hell"" and ""You're Mine"" (starring John as Satan). But the music--not the melodies, the singing and playing--adds some not-so-peculiar constraints of its own.
"
FALSE,B,Whistle Rymes,John Entwistle,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6791,"
Subjects of songs: isolation, cuckold's desertion, cuckold's rancor, cuckold's failed suicide, neurotic passivity, idiot passivity, whoring in bad faith, peeping in good faith, getting played for a fool, and nightmares. Mood of music: tuneful but stolid hard rock. Disposition of career: ""interesting.""
"
FALSE,B,Hot,The Equators,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4737,"
An all-black ska band from Britain--they posed for the cover photo in a greenhouse. Unencumbered by message, concept, or apparent neurosis, the groove has more vim, muscle, get-up-and-go than the 2-Tone competition. Less interest, though. That's the thing about neurosis--it can really be interesting.
"
FALSE,B,Born to Burn,Ethel and the Shameless Hussies,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4743,"
The music is standard-issue neohonkytonk, but at least this red hot mama who smokes in bed writes her own lines. Good for a change and sometimes a hoot, and more progressive than Janie Fricke for damn sure.
"
FALSE,B,2 Places at the Same Time,E.U.,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4744,"
Like disco DJs, go go bands get high on contingency--all the interactive variables that pertain when you try to turn a crowd of dancers into a pulsating mass. So in theory I approve of these live, side-long jams of grooveful quotes and fragments. Except for the ultimately untheoretical fact that once they're recorded, they're not so damn contingent any more.
"
FALSE,B,Sweet Dreams Are Made of This,Eurythmics,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1211,"
In theory, synth duos have always been okey-doke with me, especially when the resulting pop is as starkly hooky as what Dave Stewart comes up with here. And you might say Annie Lennox has a bono vox. But like so many with comparable gifts, both these people are fools, and pretentious fools at that. Remember, folks--when they tell you everybody's out to use or get used, make certain you go along for the ride you paid for.
"
FALSE,B,Touch,Eurythmics,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4745,"
Physical gifts and technical accomplishments tempt a singer to overdramatize--Annie Lennox makes altogether too big a deal of punching the sofa. But even if she isn't, well, ""cooler than ice cream"" (really), I'm glad she's normal enough to want to be. If it's high-grade schlock you seek, this'll do as well as early Quarterflash. And Lennox has better hair.
"
FALSE,B,What's New,Bill Evans with Jeremy Steig,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10858,"
Usually, Evans is the final proof of the triviality of technical accomplishment, but occasionally he gets together with someone who complements him properly. No heavy riffs and not much heavy beat, but nice, especially for all of you who believe you like Jethro Tull.
"
FALSE,B,Long Player,Faces,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6796,"
The difference between these guys and their smaller forebears, the ones who released round-covered albums and sang ""Itchycoo Park"" with whine and phase, isn't just Steve Marriott vs. Rod Stewart. It's 1968 vs. 1971. Marriott was a pop craftsman with the Small Faces; with Humble Pie he's a boogie man. Stewart is a pop craftsman solo; with the Faces he's a boogie man. Boogie's not a bad idea, especially when you play it fast and loose rather than 'eavy like the 'Umbles. But as exciting as it is theoretically--and by comparison with the competition, boogieing and otherwise--it doesn't have much staying power. That's partly because they play it too loose and not quite fast enough. And partly because Stewart reserves his popcraft for solo LPs.
"
FALSE,B,Ooh La La,Faces,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6797,"
They do what they want to do very likably--this is as rowdy and friendly as rock and roll gets. But only on the title song and finale--written by the Rons (Wood and Lane) rather than the Rod--do they slap your back so's you'd still feel it five minutes later.
"
FALSE,B,Totale's Turns,The Fall,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4758,"
""The difference between you and us is that we have brains,"" Mark Smith announces to what the written notes call an ""80% disco weekend mating audience"" at the top of forty-three minutes of rant. The difference I notice is that the band is getting paid, but never mind--I'm so hungry for punk these days that I'm a sucker for the overall sound, maybe even the attitude. Yet though the minutes are divided officially into ten song titles, I confess I have trouble telling one from another except to point out that ""Roche Rumble"" is pretty fierce momentumwise. I also enjoy ""Choc-Stock"" (sounds like ""pop star"") and ""That Man"" (sounds like ""Batman""). And almost any time Smith revs his delivery up toward squeal.
"
FALSE,B,Grotesque (After the Gramme),The Fall,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4759,"
As postpunk splinters into a thousand shafts of shadow, these arty lefties are definitely going for poetry readings with two-chord backing. My favorite is the first punk song ever to mention Herb Alpert, who appears not as a musical icon but as a record executive--at the company that distributed them back when they were trying to sell out.
"
FALSE,B,Slates,The Fall,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4760,"
There's no denying it--taken as a whole, the six songs do exude punk-style intelligence. Titles like ""Middle Mass,"" ""An Older Lover Etc.,"" and ""Prole Art Threat"" don't disappoint--Mark Smith is interested in the kind of stuff you want intelligent-style punks to be interested in, and gives evidence of understanding it, too. But only ""Fit and Working Again,"" marked by an exploding two-note guitar riff, makes itself felt as an individual entity. And in the end it's hard to know exactly what Smith does think about all that stuff he's interested in--except that it's interesting. Inspirational Instruction: ""Don't start improvising, for God's sake.""
"
FALSE,B,"A Part of America Therein, 1981",The Fall,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4761,"
They're as consistent as the Isley Brothers: no notable rise in quality or interest, and also no falloff. This one's a U.S.-recorded live double divided into north and south discs (San Francisco counts as south, they claim). I prefer the north, especially ""The N.W.R.A.""--stands for North (of England?) Will Rise Again--and ""Totally Wired,"" which has the boys singing backup and something that will pass for a hook.
"
FALSE,B,Fearless,The Family,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6802,"
This hooks in on ""Sat'd'y Barfly,"" which sets Roger Chapman to bellowing drunken boasts over dissonant piano chords. The rest is equally abrasive and eccentric, but not always so good-humored, which when it doesn't hook in can be a problem.
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Donna Fargo,Donna Fargo,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6810,"
Despite her fondness for rose gardens, Fargo in her prime was a lot more credible than Lynn Anderson. Her good cheer always carried real conviction, perhaps because she wrote her happiness prescriptions/descriptions herself, although that little growl she learned from Loretta didn't hurt. Only a dour young city man like me (or woman like me wife) would complain about the way hubby and Jesus combine to stop her nagging in ""How Close You Came (to Being Gone)."" But we also note that the happiest girl in the whole USA has a job and lets her husband make the coffee. And that a year later she allows as how she's just not up to cohabiting with Superman.
"
FALSE,B,Faster Pussycat,Faster Pussycat,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4768,"
Supposedly, these glammers are the plastic (isn't that the term?) Aerosmith rip, as opposed to the authentically (right?) nasty boys in Guns N' Roses. They sure do mow down their allotted share of dynamite riffs on side one, though--fit right onto Toys in the Attic. And if side two is pretty generic, it's only a rip, its meaner impulses undercut by Russ Meyer camp.
"
FALSE,B,Crushin',Fat Boys,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4771,"
Rap's longest-running cartoon has all the street credibility of a DONT WALK sign, but that doesn't mean the anticrack and procondom messages won't make an impression with the home viewing audience. Doesn't mean the boys don't crush, either. Once a homemade music starts fulfilling its fantasies in the studio, it can also be manufactured there.
"
FALSE,B,Cooper-S,Feedtime,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4774,"
Most cover albums trip over their own roots--self-conscious simplicity is too neat a trick to bring off a dozen times running. These guys are adepts of self-conscious simplicity, so naturally they have trouble negotiating the radio classics that got them started. I mean, ""Paint It Black"" and ""Street Fighting Man"" have tempo shifts, man.
"
FALSE,B,No One Knows,The Feelies,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4775,"
Adds the slightly arcane Beatles song ""She Said She Said"" to the slightly arcane Neil Young song ""Sedan Delivery"" before it resorts to two Good Earth cuts that seem doubly otiose after Jonathan Demme has proven them capable of an all-cover EP. Or LP.
"
FALSE,B,Shuffering and Shmiling,Fela,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4779,"
Circa 1977, shortly after the Army torched his compound, an incorrigible troublemaker raps about the limits of God, sometimes in outrageous mock Arabic. Only one drawback: label's marketing the 12:21-minute song plus 9:47-minute version as an $8.98-list LP. As a single, this makes my top twenty-five. As an album it's docked two notches for forced format.
"
FALSE,B,Feliz Navidad: Merry Christmas From Freddy Fender,Freddy Fender,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6816,"
A tough ex-con blissfully unembarrassed by sentimentality, and with a terrific sense of rhythm, Freddy could have made a (bilingual!) Christmas album to rank with Phil Spector's. If only Huey Meaux (producer-svengali) hadn't hogged the copyrights, thus keeping Freddy away from ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" (his kind of song!) and--even worse--""Feliz Navidad"" itself. But I kind of love it anyway, and if it doesn't match UA's rereleased 12 Hits of Christmas or Rhythm and Blues Christmas, it beats hell out of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's White (get it?) (do I have to complete this title?)
"
FALSE,B,Let's Stick Together,Bryan Ferry,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=454,"
A lot of people are crazy about this record, but I find its bifurcation alienating. On the one hand, we have the usual unlikely borrowings, the most effective from Wilbert Harrison and the Everlys. And as usual, these are powerful, strange, and interesting--and often quite compelling. On the other hand, we have unlikely remakes of old Roxy Music material, much of it from the group's very first album. Although Ferry proves that he knows more about making records (and music) than he used to, the songs remain powerful, strange, and interesting--but not quite compelling. Add it all together and you get . . . two separate parts.
"
FALSE,B,Curtis,50 Cent,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13758,"
The first giveaway is a lie no less bold-faced with his Connecticut mansion on the trading block: ""I ain't fresh out the hood, I still in the hood."" The second is a truth all too revealing of the lost urgency of his aesthetic motivation: ""I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made."" What the two boil down to is that a parvenu mastering pop music for money has turned into a made man running on vanity. I find that this renders his expert trivialization of murder and such rather less piquant, and I think he does too--that an audacious formal delight has become routine. And though his sex talk retains some charm, Eminem's gross-out cameo casts a pall. Is Slim trying to one-up R. Kelly or just his D12 doxy Bizarre?
"
FALSE,B,Scan,Fine Art,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4786,"
Lead off with a deliberate, hypnotically bass-hooked existentialist ditty called ""You Tell Me"" that's the catchiest piece of white-woman art-funk since ""Too Many Creeps,"" they roll calmly downhill until the anticlimactic ""Scheduled Interruption,"" when they fall off a cliff that students of band names will have anticipated.
"
FALSE,B,If'n,Firehose,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4788,"
They sound more like a regular rock band and also more like the Minutemen, which isn't a contradiction because the Minutemen were evolving into a regular rock band when D. Boon died--one that resembled this fluidly funky outfit a lot more than the weird and wimpy hippies of the debut. This time Ed Crawford provides enough garage hooks to get by, meaning Mike Watt doesn't disappear amid the new guy's mannerisms. I only wish Mike Watt's Central American mention held like his Richard Hell mention and his Michael Stipe tribute.
"
FALSE,B,Armed and Extremely Dangerous,The First Choice,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6821,"
The only musicians not named on the back cover are the three women depicted on the front, the ones with the voices, including a satiny lead (Rochelle Fleming, according to informed sources) who shouldn't do songs about lovable polio victims and suicidal feelings--at least not these songs. I don't expect feminist anthems against the girl-group undertow, and these people have a lot more spunk than the Three Degrees or Love Unlimited. But I do insist on high-quality schlock, and beyond the pleasant-plus hits and a memorable cover of ""Love and Happiness"" this isn't it. I know, the Shirelles and the Chiffons never made great albums either. So buy the singles.
"
FALSE,B,An Evening With Wild Man Fischer,Wild Man Fischer,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10859,"
This record has gotten good reviews everywhere and I just wanted to concur: a fascinating document. But remember--it's a document, not music, recommended only to those with a serious interest in the rock subculture. Great term paper subject. Along the way, Frank Zappa provides two object lessons in the relationship of production to original material.
"
FALSE,B,Truth and Soul,Fishbone,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4793,"
They're better at truth than soul, always a harder sell, and harder to push beyond interesting, too. Taken one at a time, about half these experiments would change any radio station's pace quite satisfactorily. Taken in sequence, they don't follow.
"
FALSE,B,Youthman Penitentiary,Edi Fitzroy,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4794,"
""With the Roots Radics Band,"" announces a subtitle, and that's the usual good sign. ""Featuring his three 1982 top 10 Jamaican hits!"" crows a sticker, and I wish I were sure that the third one (after the title track and ""First Class Citizen,"" which gives itself away with a dub) were ""Dread Locks Party"" and its borrowed sax, not ""African Queen"" and its stolen Sedaka. ""The only new vocal star to emerge this year,"" inform the notes, and I hope 1983's has more than one trick in his or her gullet.
"
FALSE,B,The Soft Bulletin,The Flaming Lips,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3611,"
Tiptoeing along the precipice that divides the charmingly serious from the hopelessly ridiculous, this year's Prestigious Pink Floyd Tribute by a Long-Running Band of Some Repute and Less Distinction enjoys two advantages over OK Computer and Deserter's Songs. Not only does it map out a sonic identity, the chief selling point of all these records, but it's not above pretty. And lead genius Wayne Coyne mixes up the quotidian and the cosmic in the best American psychedelic tradition, with a social dimension more grounded than the usual dystopian mishmash-heroic scientists, gosh. All that granted, however, listeners with no generational stake in how old alt bands impact history are obliged not only to contend with Coyne's wispy voice and chronic confusion, but to stifle their giggles when Steven Drozd bangs his drums all over a song mixing up summer love and mosquito bites. That is, these guys are Not Joking. Ever. Which makes them hopelessly ridiculous.
"
FALSE,B,Teenage Head,Flamin Groovies,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3613,"
Surprisingly bluesy, with a good Robert Johnson cover, a great John Lee Hooker rip, and lots of slide guitar. Plus the title track, an inspired articulation/sendup of ""California born and bred"" youth rebellion. But ""High Flyin Baby,"" ""Evil Hearted Ada,"" and ""Whiskey Woman"" fall into the blues-rock trap--not surprising at all.
"
FALSE,B,Shake Some Action,Flamin Groovies,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3614,"
So authentic that producer Dave Edmunds has reverted to the muddy mix--kinda like the Beatles or the Byrds or the Flamin Groovies. Actually, what it sounds like is mono electrically rechanneled for stereo. The Flamin Groovies were Haight-Ashbury enough to exploit aural distance in the service of a sly, spaced-out obliqueness, but these guys, deprived of singer-composer Roy A. Loney and making their way as an English pop-revival band, get their kicks by playing dumb. This compiles their best recent work and includes some good songs. But only cultists will ever hear them.
"
FALSE,B,Oh!,Flamin' Oh's,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11411,"
This engaging, unpretentious, skillful, and ultimately forgettable collection of pop-tunes is the kind of indie album that makes me hope everybody involved is in it for love. Musically and lyrically, its straightforwardness is charming and tangy--there's none of the calculated swarm that marred so much L.A. pop, and none of the creative strain you can hear in New York bands like the dB's and the Individuals. But by the same token it's hard to tell why these Twin Cities boys care so much about the style, and thus it's unlikely they'll make anybody who isn't within hailing distance care about them. Point of information: a follow-up is imminent.
"
FALSE,B,There's No Face Like Chrome,Flash Cadillac and the Continental Kids,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1260,"
Unlike Sha Na Na, who are forced to rediscover how great oldies are every time they write an original, this isn't strictly a copy band, and on their follow-up album they prove it. Despite their unnecessarily stupid appearance, duh guys do not revert to the '50s solely for hard grit and axle grease, either, focusing instead on the sweet and funny part of pre-Beatles rock and roll. Tunes like ""Dancin' (on a Saturday Night)"" and ""Standin' on the Corner"" are impressive exercises. But only ""First Girl"" has a shot at entering the after-the-manner-of-Leiber-&amp;-Stoller canon, and they didn't write it. Also, Jerry Leiber produced it, which must have helped quite a bit.
"
FALSE,B,Future Games,Fleetwood Mac,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1262,"
These white blues (and hippie rockabilly) veterans shouldn't have to depend on new recruit Bob Welch's deftly metallized r&amp;b extrapolation for rock and roll, but unless you count the studio jam, they do. And if the best song on the album isn't the slowest, that's only because Welch also has mystagogic tendencies. It's the simplest in any case: Christine Perfect's ""Show Me a Smile.""
"
FALSE,B,Penguin,Fleetwood Mac,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6828,"
Those who complain about the remake of ""(I'm a) Road Runner,"" with Mick Fleetwood smashing past the cymbals while Dave Walker shouts, probably think these studio craftspeople were slumming when they jammed with Otis Spann. I love it. I also like all of Christine McVie's husky laments. But could rilly do without Bob Welch's ever-mellower musings.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Fleetwood Mac,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1267,"
To my surprise, I had more fun replaying side two of Mirage, which turns out to have some weird and pleasant shit on it. Reminding me that what distinguished them from your average great pop band was that their hits were improved by their putative filler. So with some obvious--in fact, all too familiar--exceptions, the radio-ready format makes them seem blander than they actually are.

FALSE,B,Blast Off!,Fleshtones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4805,"
As a student of history I'm glad these mythic 1978 sessions are finally for sale; as a connoisseur of inspired amateurism I must remind fun-seekers that magic is hard to mass-produce. The cruddy sound doesn't make it any more like being there, and after the wacko ""Soul Struttin'"" and the anthemic ""American Beat"" I start daydreaming about the next garage.

FALSE,B,Gone Fishin',Flipper,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1269,"
I must have listened to Generic Flipper fifty times without fully registering the dark and more or less unceasing roil of Ted Falconi's guitar. On this album it was the first thing I noticed. Watch out for bands who get heavily into texture. And stop making jokes.

FALSE,B,Last of the Red Hot Burritos,The Flying Burrito Brothers,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6832,"
Chris Hillman rocking through previously unrecorded covers from ""Orange Blossom Special"" to ""Don't Fight It,"" Gram Parsons's original country-soul concept for this band lives again. Unfortunately, it lives best on the previously recorded Parsons originals. And it lived better when he was singing them.
"
FALSE,B,John Fogerty,John Fogerty,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1765,"
The best singing here is at medium tempos--Fogerty sounds distraught for no reason when he rocks out, and the revved-up horns just push him harder. But the best songwriting is on the fast side-openers--""Rockin' All Over the World"" and ""Almost Saturday Night,"" neither of which could be called an illumination. This is what happens when rock devolves from a calling into an idea--you can't even be absolutely certain it's him rather than you, but you know he'll never get away with it twice.
"
FALSE,B,Eye of the Zombie,John Fogerty,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4809,"
With his compact songs and workingman's aura, Fogerty was an outsider in the '60s. In the '80s, with his San Fran contemporaries either cozying up to MTV or peddling nostalgia on the bar circuit, it's clear that he took the visionary fallacies of the time as deeply to heart as Jerry Garcia himself, and good for him. Then as now he had no interest in fashion, which is why his music retains an undeniable modicum of interest. But like they say, the '60s are over.

FALSE,B,The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner,Ben Folds Five,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=267,"
What jerks melody inflicts on us. With no connection to any human virtue of substance, the catchy tune ushers all manner of unpleasant personality traits into our lives. And if this smart aleck is less dangerous than Fred Durst, he also does less with what he was given. For sure he's less original musically (as opposed to melodically) no matter how many piano lessons he took, banging away like a garage guitarist with the occasional fancy stuff to prove he has a right--God, Joe Jackson was more fun. And although he also throws in the occasional well-turned sentiment to prove he has a right--""Don't Change Your Plans"" and ""Mess"" are recommended to nice guys seeking covers--his basic program remains revenge-of-the-nerd. He al ways knew he was smarter than whoever and ever amen. He always knew there were people who'd admire him just because he was clever. And unfortunately, he was right.

FALSE,B,"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace",Foo Fighters,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13924,"
The real ageist scandal of this year's Grammys wasn't Herbie Hancock, who--unlike Natalie Cole and Tony Bennett in the long-lost '90s--won with the most artistically ambitious album nominee. It was this candid attempt to recapitulate Nirvana Mark II's 10-year-old triumph, The Colour and the Shape, a bonus-cutted reissue of which was released just two months before the Foos' ballyhooed reunion with producer Gil Norton, all of which can be read as the defiant professional credo of The Man Who Invented Nickelback. Kurt was a quitter, but Dave Grohl says he'll ""never surrender,"" just like the download-combatting stalwarts who chose him over Daughtry and Bruce Springsteen. Sure, Grohl is hookier than Nickelback, which is saying something. But he's not as hooky as those bonus cuts, which include Prince and Killing Joke songs, or as intense as his 1997 self. And the well-rounded optimist will go along with the hooky up-and-at-'em of ""Cheer Up, Boys"" only till he or she notices the subtitle, which is: ""(Your Make Up Is Running."") Those emo posers, how dare they?

FALSE,B,Love Letters,Force M.D.'s,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4812,"
If only there was a little something to the songwriting, the cute idea of anchoring a falsetto group to a rap rhythm section might have produced more than an exceedingly cute album. Certainly the fivesome sing sweet and rap sharp, and the LeBlanc-Wimbish-McDonald bottom is almost lithe enough for a top, even on the reggae. But not quite.
"
FALSE,B,David Forman,David Forman,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6844,"
Comparisons are odiferous, and this one--David Forman/Randy Newman--is commonplace as well. Sorry. At least I don't mean the words; except for the unconvincing ""Rosalie"" and one or two others, these employ evocative metaphor, in the manner of Jackson Browne, rather than evocative social detail. It's the r&amp;b-based singing and precise, manneristic arrangements, both (unintentionally?) redolent of Newman, that bother me. Even Jackson Browne knows that groupings of associative metaphors hold together best along a groove, and since Forman, unlike Newman, has the pipes to bring off the sweeter soul modulations, you'd figure he'd go that way. Instead, he sets each song--like a jewel, or a loose tooth in a denture. Many-faceted though they may be, these songs are neither gemlike nor biting, and the settings, unlike Newman's, too often sound readymade.
"
FALSE,B,Aretha Live at Fillmore West,Aretha Franklin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6855,"
This record almost gets over on sheer vocal excess. Neither Aretha in Paris nor any of her studio albums has ever caught her in such an explosive mood, and the result is a ""Dr. Feelgood"" that could heal the halt and versions of ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" that sound like Sunday morning. But though the speedy tempos help vitalize those last two songs as well, they do less than nothing for ""Respect"" and ""Don't Play That Song"" and can't save ""Love the One You're With"" or ""Make It With You"" (did she have to do 'em both?). And while in theory nothing could be more exciting than an eight-minute duet with Ray Charles on ""Spirit in the Dark,"" in practice I'd rather hear Ray sing ""The Three Bells"" and Aretha go it alone.
"
FALSE,B,Sparkle,Aretha Franklin,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6860,"
Aretha vamping over competent-plus Curtis Mayfield tracks is sexy at worst, mixing rhythmic and emotional frisson, soul product as it should be, albeit deplorably post-verbal. Good late-night listening, I suppose--but not as good as Spirit in the Dark, or Super Fly.
"
FALSE,B,La Diva,Aretha Franklin,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6863,"
Blame what's wrong with this record on the late trite Van McCoy, one of the most tasteless arrangers ever to produce an LP. What saves it is that McCoy didn't control half of these songs--arrangements by Richard Gibbs and Arthur Jenkins (rhythm only) and Zulema Cusseaux and Skip Scarborough (rhythm plus orchestration) provide frequent relief. Aretha contributes two sisterly originals, which are really fine, and one loverly original, which isn't. Because McCoy keeps intruding she never gets a flow going. But there haven't been this many good cuts on an Aretha album in five years.

I don't trust Franks's sambas to drowse by, but when he mentioned that he heard from his ex on the back of his checks he woke me up long enough to make me believe he had some smarts. Quite a lot of smarts, actually. Then I dozed off again.

FALSE,B,Fire and Water,Free,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6867,"
From sodden blooze to steady, unpretentious rock and roll in three progressively simpler--as opposed to easier--albums, climaxing with ""All Right Now,"" a bone-crunching single you can groan along with. Recommended follow-up: a shortened ""Mr. Big."" Predicted follow-up: the already shortened ""Fire and Water.""
"
FALSE,B,Highway,Free,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6868,"
I know you think they're dumb, but they're not, they're just slow, and this intelligent noise proves it. Every instrument in what is basically a trio format must make a solo-quality contribution, yet every one is held in check, by the tempos and the structures in which flash is strictly discouraged. The tension that results is more gripping here than on Fire and Water because vocalist Paul Rodgers and guitarist Paul Kossoff have mastered the reined-in expressiveness that comes naturally to drummer Simon Kirke and (especially) bassist Andy Fraser--last time they showed off, but this time you can hear them trying not to. Equally important, the tracks average 3:48 instead of 5:02. But though there are hints of melodic and verbal facility as well, there aren't enough.
"
FALSE,B,Free at Last,Free,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15523,"
The usual steadily unpretentious hard rock. This one sounds a little sodden and listless at first, but it does come on. Nice extension of a simple, intelligent concept, recommended to the group's fans.
"
FALSE,B,Stimulus Package,Freeway & Jake One,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14995,"
Known, moderately talented Philadelphia rapper whose gold album failed to make him a star on Roc-a-Fella in the good old early '00s hooks up with quality, deservedly solvent Twin Cities indie-rap label hungry for street cred. The co-billed producer is a Seattleite who works both sides of the cred street, the packaging elaborately impractical--paperboard wallet surrounded by giant Freeway/Jake One Bucks with lyrics etc. on back. And the CD reveals a talent as moderate as ever, still on the lookout for that ""pot of gold."" The standout ""One Foot In"" states the options he sees: ""I got one foot in the game one foot in the gutter/If my music don't bubble I feel sorry for your mother."" The Raekwon-enhanced hookmobile ""One Thing"" reserves special contumely for that lowly creature, the snitch. So I'm asking myself, is this ""reality""? Or is he fronting like so many hip-hop hards before him? Does ""criticizing"" his talent constitute snitching? Should I like him so nobody gets hurt? Poor Freeway. Poor Rhymesayers. Poor everybody.

FALSE,B,Sold American,Kinky Friedman,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6873,"
Too bad Kinky's unique cross between Don Rickles and Woody Guthrie extends to his singing. Doesn't matter on the lip-smackingly tasteless ""Ballad of Charles Whitman"" or the foolproof ""We Reserve the Right to Refuse Service."" But when he gets a leetle serious, as on the title song or the signature ""Ride 'Em Jewboy,"" you wish his voice could convey something of what he means.

Much as I admire Karen Durbin, Chip Stern, Terre Roche, Richard Goldstein, and Ellen Willis, to list only those commentators whose spoken overlays I recognize from personal conversation, I'm just as glad none of them was theorizing in my ear during last year's League of Gentlemen gigs at Irving Plaza, where Fripp's ""dance band"" sounded somewhat less dinky. And that goes double for J.G. Bennett.
"
FALSE,B,The Fun Boy Three,Fun Boy Three,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4835,"
This spinoff stretches the Specials even thinner--so thin it's like a minimalist statement, as if chants and jingles were the music of the people. And though ""The Lunatics"" is the only track I'm hooked on (I sing it for anyone within earshot and sound like Robert Goulet by comparison), it might be novelty album of the year if all the others achieved the rudimentary, skeptical charm of ""Faith, Hope and Charity"" and ""The Telephone Always Rings.""
"
FALSE,B,Cosmic Slop,Funkadelic,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1307,"
Thank, well, Whomever, the ""maladroited message of doom"" inside the doublefold comes not from Brother Malachi but from Sir Lleb, and Whomever has rewarded the band with two definitively scary takes on sex and life in the future present--""Cosmic Slop"" and ""No Compute,"" both of which combine humor, pessimism, incantation, and baloney in convincing and unprecedented amalgams. Unfortunately, most of the rest is ""interesting,"" including one profundo Vietnam monologue and many parodies of harmony-group usage.
"
FALSE,B,Fun Around the World,The Furies,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4838,"
Sticking their art-pop in your face, they write cute rock and roll tunes about their band, a famous band, an opera singer, a private museum, ""arts and crafts."" ""There is no difference between art and life,"" they warble; violence and pullution and Russia they know about from the San Fran Chronicle. Their best songs are about a female friendship (they ""talk about art"") and a lousy lover (the opera singer). Their candor is refreshing, their triviality not quite clever enough.
"
FALSE,B,Loose,Nelly Furtado,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13367,"
Although the Toronto hopeful remains an Intriguing Meld who identifies Latina and loves hip-hop, her Timbaland album has the paradoxical effect of bringing out the Canadian in her. Running the show for the attempted sex symbol is an undistinguished singer-songwriter hawking her Intriguing Meld. ""Maneater,"" ""No Hay Igual,"" and the Arab-Indian ""Wait for Me"" might accomplish God's great plan on the dance-floor. But as songs they're not much. Which doesn't stop the artist from pointing out that ""Maneater"" isn't solely about one of those mythical creatures--it ""speaks to the consumerist world we live in."" Oh really?
"
FALSE,B,On Fire,Galaxie 500,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1323,"
Who needs world-beat when indie darlings might as well be singing in Tagalog? I don't mean the words are physically or even semantically incomprehensible, either. Twinkies and decomposing trees and staring at the wall do break through the fog; motivated, I could probably construct a lyric sheet. But just like Lisandro Meza or Chaba Fadela, only not as well, what they produce for the curious outsider is a sound--halting, folk-psychedelic guitar signatures that establish each song's atmosphere. With George Harrison's ""Isn't it a pity"" the measure of their wisdom, verbal motivation isn't on the agenda.
"
FALSE,B,Dee Dee,Dee Dee Sharp Gamble,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4852,"
After ""Breaking and Entering"" and ""Let's Get This Party Started"" get the party started, Dee Dee torches into ""I Love You Anyway,"" written to a disaffected hub by none other than ex-hub Kenny G. This she brings off with such heartbrokenly matter-of-fact determination--all for show, I hope--that I felt ready for a whole side of slow ones. Which unfortunately I got.
"
FALSE,B,Hard,Gang of Four,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1327,"
This record is damn near dead on its feet, but I don't think the missing ingredient is Hugo Burnham's human chops so much as his humane spirit. The sick-soul-of-success lyrics are part of it--even their most received new-left truisms always had a sloganeering hookiness about them. What really makes the difference, though, is the detachment of Jon King's delivery. If I didn't know better, I'd wonder whether now he really wants to turn into Phil Oakey. And actually, I don't know better.

FALSE,B,Reflections,Jerry Garcia,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6883,"
Though it's slow going, this is the first sign in years that Jerry and Robert can still write songs. I said songs, Robert, not lyrics. But sometimes, as Allen Toussaint might put it (and Jerry does), I'll take a melody.

FALSE,B,Never Can Say Goodbye,Gloria Gaynor,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6891,"
The disco-hit side (three multi-percussed six-minute cuts, two of them Motown remakes) is a solid, danceable B plus. The flip (five shorter songs, the most irritating written by the singer herself) punches in at C or maybe lower. That averages out to B minus or maybe lower. But albums with listenable sides are all too rare these days.
"
FALSE,B,Ladies Invited,The J. Geils Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6896,"
So much better than Bloodshot that for a while I thought it was something special, and in a way it is--an r&amp;b album that includes a song about wind chimes. Would they were all as tuneful. Still, a lot of the ersatz-funk macho has disappeared from the lyrics, Peter Wolf's singing has picked up several layers of sweetness and nuance, and a couple of times they even try a harmony-group move. Inspirational Title: ""The Lady Makes Demands.""
"
FALSE,B,Selling England by the Pound,Genesis,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6904,"
The best rock jolts folk-art virtues--directness, utility, natural audience--into the present with shots of modern technology and modernist dissociation; the typical ""progressive"" project attempts to raise the music to classical grandeur or avant-garde status. Since ""raise"" is usually code for ""delegitimize,"" I'm impressed that on half of this Peter Gabriel makes the idea work: his mock-mythologized gangland epic and menacing ocean pastorale have a complexity of tone that's pretty rare in any kind of art. Even more amazing, given past performances, organist Tony Banks defines music to match, schlocky and graceful and dignified all at once--when he's got it going, which is nowhere near often enough. As for the rest, it sounds as snooty as usual.
"
FALSE,B,Georgia Satellites,Georgia Satellites,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8234,"
If you love ""Keep Your Hands to Yourself"" for its own raunchy self rather than appreciating the alternative it afford to Bon Jovi and Cyndi Lauper, you want this album. Opening the B is a bottleneck rocker that slides as hard as ""Happy,"" and while nothing else matches the inspiration of hit and follow-up, these guys do know how to put out those two-guitar basics. They just don't know why--except to provide an alternative to Bon Jovi and Cyndi Lauper. ""Happy,"" after all, never pretends to be anything more than a change of pace, and because Keith Richards understands its limits, he's lining up a new front man right now.
"
FALSE,B,Son of Obituary,George Gerdes,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6909,"
Gerdes has a weakness for the kind of high extruded wordplay that only the stoned survive, and he uses the word ""existential"" in two different songs. Of course, one time he's jesting, as is his wont; quite frequently these songs fall somewhere between the funny, the acerbic, and the wacked out, which ain't a bad place to be. But too often the joke--like the voice--wears thin.
"
FALSE,B,Ren���,Ren���,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11413,"
Others marvel that this transplanted Aussie is white; I marvel that she's female. If she recalls Tina Turner it's Tina Turner in her (often overstated) rock mode, covering Lee Michael's ""Do You Know What I Mean"" and (the real giveaway) Chuck Berry's ""Come On."" And half the time she could almost be Paul Rodgers essaying a comeback. As if Paul Rodgers could make macho sound so human.

FALSE,B,Lotti Golden,Lotti Golden,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11710,"
With proper promotion from a big label, this might take off; her previous LP was promoted by Atlantic and went nowhere, but then, it was terrible. This time, Golden's egregious overstatement registers as a strength--her passion, even if affected, is intense enough to embarrass you.

FALSE,B,Somebody Else's Troubles,Steve Goodman,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6920,"
He wrote ""City of New Orleans,"" which is not on this album, and songs about car towing and organic food, which are. Also two consecutive songs about racing the sun, which is at least one too many. Tour de force: an a cappella ballad about a Vietnam widow. Arif Mardin found the proper setting for his young man's quaver.
"
FALSE,B,Jessie's Jig & Other Favorites,Steve Goodman,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6921,"
Very likable, bright and open and good humored, but like so many solo performers, folkies especially, he can't fill an album. This isn't a question of venality--Goodman is too honest to stretch himself onto a production schedule. But his talent requires mood changes more conspicuous than so subtle an instrumentalist, or so thin a vocalist, can provide. Remember groups?
"
FALSE,B,Say It in Private,Steve Goodman,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6922,"
If a smart journeyman like Goodman were consistently great, he'd be a genius, not a smart journeyman, and on one side the smart, slick songs attract interest without commanding it. But side two is a tiny folkie tour de force, drily reworking genre expectations so that we mourn Mayor Daley, sort of, bid a jolly farewell to our century, sort of, and know that Goodman's father is dead for real.
"
FALSE,B,Santa Ana Winds,Steve Goodman,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4873,"
Recorded shortly before Goodman died in October, this is a fitting testament to a likable artist who often went soft around the edges. Goodman's intelligence never quelled his appetite for bathos, be it honest (""I Just Keep Falling in Love""), parodic (""Fourteen Days""), or stupid (""The Face on the Cutting Room Floor""). He liked to laugh (""The Big Rock Candy Mountain""), but though he was a clever satirist (""Hot Tub Refugee""), his targets were rarely original (""Telephone Answering Tape""). And oh yeah--he did love music (""You Better Get It While You Can (The Ballad of Carl Martin)""). Since he never made an altogether convincing album, now would be the ideal time for the indie label he founded when the majors said bye to put together a big fat compilation. Wanna help out, Asylum? Buddah? Yeah sure.
"
FALSE,B,Rock Billy Boogie,Robert Gordon,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6925,"
Gordon's nouveau rockabilly has always been a mite slick and a mite fast, and this is his best album because he's no longer hiding it--his blown notes are just blown notes, not stigmata of authenticity. Credit Chris Spedding's unnaturally adaptable guitar, which drives the music more aptly than Link Wray's raw protohippie licks, authentic though they may have been. I mean, half the time Gordon actually sounds as though he belongs there. Blows some notes, though.
"

I've gotten to where I enjoy almost all of this a little, even the original compositions by Wray, who on every evidence except that of his guitar ought to retire to the Fools Hall of Fame. But it's nowhere near as exciting as Gordon's Tuff Darts album would have been; it's nowhere near as exciting as ""Red Hot,"" the only cut that jumps out at you the way this good ole rock 'n' roll is presumably supposed to; and it's nowhere near as exciting as the Gordon-Wray band on a good night, which is really the point. I've run into that confluence of events several times; if you haven't, you won't find this worth your time.

FALSE,B,Disco Nights,GQ,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6926,"
One great original, one good original, and well-chosen covers (from Billy Stewart and A Taste of Honey). Lots of vocal flexibility, sincerity, and spirit. In short, don't just buy the single, remember the name.
"
FALSE,B,Shinin' On,Grand Funk,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6932,"
Now this really is an American band--confident, healthy, schlocky, uncomplicated on the surface and supporting all manner of contradictions underneath. I prefer the title cut, which bursts with a--you should pardon the expression--raw power they've never managed before, to ""The Loco-Motion,"" where Mark sounds shaky. But how many bands get to record a ninth album, much less make it their best?
"
FALSE,B,Terrapin Station,Grateful Dead,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6938,"
Although this may be the Dead's best studio album since American Beauty, it runs a distant second, just nosing out the likes of Wake of the Flood, and will convert no one. In fact, it's a good thing Weir-Barlow's ""Estimated Prophet"" and Lesh-Monk's ""Passenger"" are the band's best originals in years, because Donna Godchaux's singer-songwriting debut is a disgrace; similarly, it takes a terse, jumping arrangement of ""Samson and Delilah"" to cancel out (and then some) a questionable ""Dancing in the Streets."" A confusion of quality also pervades the Garcia-Hunter title suite on side two. It works pretty well musically; for a while, I was ready to turn in the kazoo on ""Alligator"" for Paul Buckmaster. Then I listened to the lyric, a fable so polite it sent me hustling back to the verbal, vocal, and musical crudities of Anthem of the Sun, which ""Terrapin Station"" recalls formally. Amazing how all the hard-won professionalism of a decade disintegrates in the face of the sporadic, irresistible inspiration of their lysergic youth.

In this uncommonly loving compilation, Dead head Paul Wexler does what he can to eliminate the fecklessly smug and the recklessly experimental. It coheres as well as Dead albums usually do, and offers two nice singles, which is nice. But ""Me and My Uncle,"" which hardly counts, is the only cover, a questionable decision. Plus--here's the real catch--four (out of eight) songs from Workingman's Dead, which coheres a good deal better.

Couldn't figure out why I found myself basically unmoved by this exquisitely sung collection of hymns, four of them familiar to me since my days in the First Presbyterian Church of Flushing. Then I realized that the Memphis groove of Al's first two Myrrh albums had somehow turned into rote tent-gospel timekeeping. Then I read the back of the album and learned that it was cut in Nashville, with all that implies. Which may also be why I know the material from First Pres. Going ""sacred"" on us, Al? Crossing over to the other side?

FALSE,B,Trust in God,Al Green,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4896,"
Al shouldn't let his originals out of Sunday school these days, but he's always had a way with the covers. ""Lean on Me"" and the rushed, simplistic ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" are too obvious, but elsewhere he's his usual catholic self (that's a small C, Al--look it up); here he takes over ""No Not One,"" which he found in an old church, and there ""Up the Ladder to the Roof,"" which he found on an old Supremes album. And the uptempo country rollick he makes out of Joe South's ""Don't It Make You Want to Go Home"" is up there with the downcast urban plaint he made out of the Bee Gees' ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.""

Dan Stuart and friends are as hooky as the L.A. trash aesthetic gets, with Chris Cacavas's organ the nugget. But though lots of New York bands ought to wish they'd thought of ""Aspirin"" first, Stuart would be easier to take straight if he didn't favor the B-movie imagery so prevalent in the film capital of the world.
"
FALSE,B,Lone Star State of Minid,Nanci Griffith,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2501,"
Band's the same, and there's not a whole hell of a lot of distance between Jim Rooney, a marketwise old folk pro, and Tony Brown, a principled neo country pro. Yet Brown's production provides the soupcon of schlock that turns the raucous ""Ford Econoline"" into a landmark of country feminism as well as saving ""Trouble in the Fields,"" about noble victims selling the new John Deere to till their family farm with their own sweat and sinew. Too often, though, she's still a folkie playing just folks.

When the music's density and country-soul accent surround an obscurantist lyric like ""Seven Sleepers' Den"" you'd swear you were listening to the Band. But at times Jeffreys also achieves uncanny resemblances to M. Jagger and B. Dylan, which must be how he got to write ""They Call Me Fortune and Fame."" And he says more with good-time rockers like ""Sister Divine"" and ""Won't Ya Come Back Home"" than with ""Steven Sleepers' Den"" or ""An Imaginary Invalid."" Moli���"

Unlike the hebephrenic country-rock clowns he superficially resembles--you know, the guys who make you want to run out and buy the complete works of Black Sabbath--Henry is really fun, dedicating one song to a porn-star friend of his and wooing Sweet Sassafrass on Eastern Parkway. Brooklyn--Borough of Songwriters.

FALSE,B,Caravan Tonight,Steven Grossman,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6954,"
If I were gay, I imagine I'd love th is record, because it would be about me, which would certainly be a relief, but even so I'd complain about the husky forced sensitivity of the folkie voice and the now-and-again sugar of the string arrangements. As things stand I find myself touched by his slight lisp, engaged by his melodies, enlightened by his intelligence, and (sugar will out) moved almost to tears by the title song.

FALSE,B,American Woman,The Guess Who,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1466,"
As a Canadian, Burton Cummings is no doubt aiming his ""symbolic"" rage more at the ""American"" than at the ""woman,"" but his choice of ""symbol"" is no less despicable for its putative naivete. I like the riff that goes with it, though, and except for the poetasting ""Talisman"" can find it in me to enjoy every cut on this record. The beat is unyielding as well as wooden, Randy Bachman's square yet jazzy guitar style is one of a kind, and the lyrics usually give up a phrase or two worth humming. AM fans should be proud.

FALSE,B,Gun,Gun,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11077,"
This was released last summer and will probably reach the 89-cent racks soon. Well, one cut, ""Race with the Devil,"" is worth 89 cents all by itself, and the general level is far above that of your normal forgotten hard-rock lp.

FALSE,B,Fire of Love,The Gun Club,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4903,"
Mix slide guitar with loose talk about sex, death, and, er, Negroes, and pass yourselves off as the Rolling Stones of the nuevo wavo. Wish I could claim absence of merit, but in fact it has its tunelessly hooky allure. No matter how seriously Jeffrey Lee Pierce pretends not to take it, though, I'll take it less seriously than that--and more.

FALSE,B,Last of the Brooklyn Cowboys,Arlo Guthrie,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6959,"
That the folkie mind set dwells in the recording studio these days is a truth only new folk-rock songs as original as ""City of New Orleans"" can make me like. Instead, the best new tune here, Arlo's celebration of the Guthries' fiddling tradition, sounds suspiciously like a traditional fiddle tune. And I never had much use for ""Gates of Eden"" in its, er, authentic version.

FALSE,B,The Best of Arlo Guthrie,Arlo Guthrie,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=160,"
A best-of with a theme: The Rehabilitation of a Smart-Ass. Side one leads with ""Alice's Restaurant Massacre,"" retrieved from Arlo's otherwise amateurish debut, and then reprises two tuneful if soggy religious numbers. Side two leads with ""Motorcycle (Significance of the Pickle) Song,"" rescued from Arlo's unnecessary live collaboration with Uncle Pete, follows with the hippie-desperado anthem ""Coming Into Los Angeles,"" and then ""progresses"" into the reconciliation and nostalgia of Arlo's mature period. I have nothing against his mature period, but it's represented more cogently and unpredictably on Arlo Guthrie and Amigo. This would be more listenable, albeit less educational, if all the folk-punk stuff were on the same side.

FALSE,B,Outlasting the Blues,Arlo Guthrie,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6962,"
These reflections on God, love, and death are substantial and obviously earned, but too often they're just not acute. The problem isn't his religious overview, either--think of T-Bone Burnett. Guthrie simply goes soft aesthetically at crucial moments, and although most of the material is creditable enough, only once--on ""Epilogue,"" Guthrie's ""Under Ben Bulben""--is the enormous emotional potential of the project realized.

FALSE,B,One Kiss Leads to Another,Hackamore Brick,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6963,"
This audition tape by the Venus in Furs Society--a record collectors club whose firsthand contact with ""decadence"" consists of one DMT experience and moderate quantities of oral sex--bears a spooky resemblance to The Velvet Underground (LP number three, the lyrical one). Chick Newman's sour pitch has the deadpan emotional resonance of Lou Reed's, only folkier and more sanguine. The flat, droning beat is pure Maureen Tucker. And the organ solos are obviously an hommage to John Payne of the Serpent Power.

FALSE,B,Tunes From the Well,Bob Hadley,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11324,"
I love John Fahey, but I'm no aficionado of the school of solo guitar he's inspired--attempted visionaries like Robbie Basho and Leo Kottke lack his courage and clarity, while most of the others are just folkies with new chops. Hadley's a folkie, too--his vision is more earthbound than Fahey's. But it does deserve to be called a vision.

FALSE,B,Okie from Muskogee,Merle Haggard and the Strangers,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6964,"
Despite some slack performances, this album--recorded live during Haggard's first appearance in the city he made famous and vice versa, and the only LP to date to include any version of the title song--is a passable sampler. The wild crowd and predictable fooforaw--he gets an official Okie pin and the key to the city--give it documentary value. But The Best of Merle Haggard is a lot more representative of a great iconoclast who's keeping it under wraps these days. Tell us, Merle, just which college dean do you respect?

FALSE,B,It's Not Love (But It's Not Bad),Merle Haggard and the Strangers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6969,"
Merle hasn't played the poor boy in quite some time, but as he's turned into a legend he's all too often turned to gimmicky pseudo-concepts. This mainstream country album--his first since Hag--does more justice to its title than many of his more pretentious efforts. Nothing special, just marriage and its travails, but play it twice and you'll remember most of it.

Continuing Capitol's reclamation/exploitation of his last five or six years with the label, this compiles his best originals from the period. Pretty conventional--when he does try to add a little something (I like the play on ""grind"" in the trucking song), it's rarely quite enough.
"
FALSE,B,Big City,Merle Haggard,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4911,"
Having charged CBS considerable to slide into that notch on Billy Sherrill's gun, Merle signifies his seriousness by saving the flaky stuff for next year and clearing his throat before he sings. This isn't just for his cult--it's for the whole damn country audience. ""My Favorite Memory"" and ""I Always Get Lucky With You"" are love songs that may cloy eventually but at least stick for now. ""Big City"" and ""Are the Good Times Really Over"" are by the Merle who wrote that song about hippies. And just like on a real Nashville album, you can only tell how much filler there is by listening till you're sick of it.
"
FALSE,B,Songwriter,Merle Haggard,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4916,"
The best cuts here would make His Best better. But the real reason Haggard has never chalked up the great compilations a great country artist has in him is the reason MCA is perfectly justified in repackaging duff stuff like ""Red Bandana"" and ""From Graceland to the Promised Land."" On the country charts, those were hits--that's the way the country audience can be with great country artists. Best cut: the dangerously self-referential ""Footlights,"" which was never released as a single.

FALSE,B,Loud,Half Japanese,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4920,"
Art moves get a lot more half-assed these days than this musically illiterate atonal jazz-punk. The noise becomes wearing, and (ask DNA) professional recording would do wonders for the textures, but front man Jad Fair is hysterical in more ways than one, and both are appropriate. My favorite moments are his plans to trash his high school, his squalling baby routine, and his mysteriously sexy Doors cover.

This is the band cultists love, give or take a few tokens of encroaching maturity--the tantrums are shorter and more entertaining, the musical forms marginally recognizable.

Do these guys still worry about being mistaken for the O'Jays? I suppose you could call them soulful, but in the style of one of those hairdressers (no imputation of sexual preference intended) who doubles as an unlicensed therapist. I admit that cut by cut and counting this is their most impressive album. Hall gets two tart ain't-love-a-bitch songs out of a broken romance that seems to have touched his ""heart,"" while Oates puts his name on homages to Aerosmith and Talking Heads. But it's docked a notch because after all these years I still don't know which one's the blond.

FALSE,B,Big Bam Boom,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4927,"
What makes these guys so depressing is their definitive proof that instinctive musicality insures no other human virtue. Rival popsters, Bruce and Cyndi included, don't do nearly as much for Arthur Baker's hip-hop dub, which in this context is sly and graceful and goofy and catchy and thrilling, and they even have the good taste to like, you know, soul. Yet if in the end you think the music doesn't connect, you get a gold star--the affluent anomie I wish were only a pop-sociology clich������������������ pervades not just the lyrics but the mix itself. And you want to know something even more depressing? Millions of reco"

Except for ""Ballad of Forty Dollars,"" a dispassionate account of a day in the life as a gravedigger, and ""Homecoming,"" a melodramatic account of a day in his life as a star, all the zingers here compiled are also available on better albums--albums that don't include songs of inspirational tolerance like ""I Washed My Face in the Morning Dew"" and ""One Hundred Children,"" which Hall executes no more wisely than any other mortal.

Counting Greatest Hits this is the fourth LP from Hall in about a year, and while it's better than the last one the workload still shows. The title isn't quite a misnomer, but he does seem to be cranking out them yarns instead of looking for his own truth within them, and for the second straight album the most impressive cut is a straight love song--""Souvenirs"" on We All Got Together, ""When Nobody Wants Your Body Anymore"" here. How about picking up some new material on a long vacation, T?

FALSE,B,You Can Sing on the Left or Bark on the Right,Dirk Hamilton,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6980,"
This is one of those records that makes me wish I wasn't in the grading business. I really like it a lot, to the point of positively loving one song, ""She Don't Squash Bugs,"" and getting a nice buzz every time I hear the opening lines of cut one. And while good words are the point, the good words are expressly musical; that is, they are designed for Hamilton's plosive drawl, a delivery in the general tradition of Van Morrison. Hamilton's earth mysticism recalls Morrison, too, and unlike Morrison he has a sense of humor. But also unlike Morrison, he has zilch gift for the hook; he's repetitive in the folk rather than the rock manner. So, all you subtlety fans (you know who you are) might take a chance.
"
FALSE,B,Shakin' That Rockabilly Fever,Billy Hancock & the Tennessee Rockets,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4930,"
Don't misunderstand--he wants to shake ""it,"" as it's called, not the fever, and sometimes he actually sounds hot. A Virginia boy whose career began in 1959, the year the singer turned thirteen and the music died, Billy gets off one classic rocker (""Please Don't Touch"") and one inspired medium-fast ballad (""Lonely Blue Boy""), venturing closer to the EP grail than such fellow semiauthentics as Ray Campi and Sleepy LaBeef, not to mention the current crop of hair sculptors. But he does it more with his will than his voice, and even though he comes by his affection for echo and hiccup naturally, they're still mannerisms that can't sound any more spontaneous after twenty-three years of adolescence.
"
FALSE,B,Love Needs,The Harptones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4935,"
With their serious tempos and platonic quest, the Harptones are archetypal doowop purists: even 1953's ""A Sunday Kind of Love,"" an acknowledged classic, failed to crease the national r&amp;b (or pop) charts. On this uncompromising album they almost get away with it because Willie Winfield, now fifty-three and a professional funeral director, retains the virtually characterless sapling tenor of a half-formed youth. Absolutely lovely--too absolute, in fact. Only on Jackson Browne's ""Love Needs a Heart,"" its lyric, melody, and vocal harmonies all touched with an uncharacteristically complex pain, do they achieve the transcendence they long for. Inspirational Verse: ""Take this for what it's worth/I am yours, you are mine.""

FALSE,B,Luxury Liner,Emmylou Harris,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1174,"
Not content with her corner on the wraith-with-a-twang market, some folk's favorite folkie manque has added funk and raunch and echo and overdub to her voice. The result is a record I play some, perhaps out of sheer surprise. Song selection also helps--an unforgettable Townes Van Zandt melody is unearthed, and the two Gram Parsons selections don't automatically shame themselves by recalling the originals.
"
FALSE,B,Wrecking Ball,Emmylou Harris,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1178,"
The reason Harris's instant comeback is an irritation, not a tragedy, is that the inspired collaborator and nonpareil backup singer has no vision of her own for Daniel Lanois to ruin. Her artistic personality has always been coextensive with her miraculously lucid voice, which now that it's fraying with age is ripe for Lanois's one seductive trick: to gauze over every aural detail and call your soft focus soul. I doubt she would have nailed the songs anyway--often she doesn't. But she would have come closer than this.
"
FALSE,B,Anything You Want,Wilbert Harrison,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6989,"
Let's Work Together was an anachronistic, even primitive r&amp;b album based on the fluke hit of the same name, which makes this the follow-up. Side one consists entirely of roll and rock songs you'd swear you've heard before--""Your Three Letters,"" eh, and what's this ""Let's Stick Together,"" and why not bring out ""Kansas City"" again? Very unprepossessing, very charming. In fact, if the second side weren't all standards and uncharming filler--only ""Sentimental Journey"" is even funny--I wouldn't be recommending this to r&amp;b diehards only.
"
FALSE,B,Rockbird,Debbie Harry,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=990,"
It's her achievement and her curse that just listening to the record you'd think she never went away. Vocal technique and vocal identity are sharper than when she withdrew from the fray five years ago, and the songs are brasher and more insouciant than on The Hunter or KooKoo or Autoamerican. If the sound could be a mite fresher, that's because the world is now overrun with the dance-rock Harry made possible--just as it's overrun with cartoon sexpots carrying tunes, whose collective existence give her a larger identity problem she refuses to confront. But it's also because the late '70s were Harry's heyday. Not too many pop icons get more than one of those.

Hartford's come a long way from ""Gentle on My Mind"" and eccentric bids for stardom. These days he sings mostly about the mighty Mississip (too thick to navigate, too thin to plow) and records eccentric river music for a folk label. He's slightly the better for it, on the whole--but I wouldn't say his living sounds so secure that he should turn down a gig on the Proud Mary. A gig playing, or a gig navigating.

Too bad one of the few disco albums that out-dollar-for-dollars the corresponding disco single is this super-efficient piece of rock funk, but deserving souls who dally with mechanization can't complain when bested by a real machine. Sole monkey wrench: the slow one, ""Time and Space,"" on which Hartman breaks his own rule by trying to write a meaningful lyric and then triples the misdemeanor by running it through his own larynx. Who does he think he is, Robert Plant? Machines can't sing.

FALSE,B,A Whole Nother Thang,Fuzzy Haskins,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1321,"
""Which Way Do I Disco"" and ""Sometimes I Rock and Roll"" set up an antinomy that George Clinton's second-favorite guitarist doesn't do much with. Both would have fit nicely onto Tales of Kidd Funkadelic, too--as would one (though not all three) of the love songs. Half a thang is the way I reckon it--or too many thangs.

""Fourth world music: classical by structure, popular by textural appeal, global-minded,"" explain the notes. The goal is worthy enough, the result basically friendly and weird, just like the year's Eno collaboration. But with Eno ancillary, the textural appeal is artier than necessary, from the muted trumpet stutter of the irritating opening cut to the sequenced fieldtape fragment of the centerpiece to the dust on the needle that conquers all before the finale is finalized.

FALSE,B,Happy Hour,Ted Hawkins,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4942,"
This L.A.-based folk bluesman can bring you up short by latching onto homely details or just telling the embarrassing truth. I'll never forget ""Bad Dog"" (""What's the reason your dog don't bark at that man?"") or ""You Pushed My Head Away"" (""Baby that sucker had to learn too""). But the unaffected can also be naive, and the unsophisticated can also be received. To ignore how often he falls into both traps is to condescend to an artist who deserves our respect.

If the 24-year-old Desser gets to be Lou Barlow when he grows up, which took Barlow years, he'll look back on most of these self-consciously casual vignettes as bores or embarrassments. He's best on young love, nice-guy style, especially when he and his girlfriend stay in bed all day. But the unnatural effort of extragenerational empathy makes him howl in agony. And if he really didn't know that the Susan Smith murders ""were gonna become a huge media thing,"" he hasn't yet learned the first thing about the impossible border between the private and the public.

It figures you'd find the heavy metal down toward the bottom of the barrel--still strong stuff, but except maybe for the ""Highway Chile"" riff and the sheer speed of ""Steppin' Stone,"" nothing springs out.

This one makes you listen--its abrupt shapes and electro/symphonic textures never whisper Eagles remake. So thank cocomposer, multi-instrumentalist, and occasional arranger Danny Kortchmar, whose ""You're Not Drinking Enough"" (Merle Haggard, call your agent) and ""All She Wants to Do Is Dance"" (T-Bone Burnett, ditto) are at once the simplest and most effective songs on the record. Then blame the turgid lengths, tough-guy sensitivity, and ""women are the only works of art"" on the auteur, who still thinks perfect love is when you're crazy and she screams.

FALSE,B,The Henry Cow Legend,Henry Cow,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7005,"
Composed to encourage improvisation, influenced by jazz yet identifying with Europe, and categorizable only as rock (although calling one cut ""Teenbeat"" is stretching things), the music of these Cambridge progressives is more flexible than King Crimson's and more stringently conceived than Soft Machine's. As is usual in this style, not everything works. As is also usual, the guitar (Fred Frith) carries more clout than the saxophone (Geoff Leigh). As is not usual, you can listen to what few lyrics there are without getting sick.

This 1975 U.K. release was Cow's second collaboration with guitarist-composer Peter Blegvad, pianist-composer Anthony Moore, and vocalist Dagmar, and if it's less successful than the earlier Desperate Straights (still an import here), that's not the new guys' fault. Dagmar's abrasively arty, Weill-derived style, as bluesless and European as any ""rock"" singing ever recorded, does manage to find a context for words that seem literary if not pompous in print; in fact, between Dagmar and the Weillish Moore-Blegvad and Tim Hodgkinson music on side one, the lyrics seem almost as astute politically as the title. But except for some atonal Fred Frith piano, the music on side two is dominated by less than winning musique concrete experiments that make such injunctions as ""Arise Work Men and seize/the Future"" seem completely academic.

This reminds me that British skinheads were reggae fans--it shares its sexual brutality and rhythmic monotonousness with the most desperate and overbearing heavy rock.

I was about to note bemusedly that Herald's best songs on this album--""Wiggle Worm Wiggle"" and ""I'm Getting Ready to Go""--could have been written fifty years ago. Indeed they could have, because both are old bluegrass tunes. ""Slightly Blind"" and ""With Every Month"" are quite up-to-date. After that, details get hazy.

FALSE,B,Hangin' Around the Observatory,John Hiatt,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1776,"
Hiatt is a Midwestern boy who wrings off-center rock and roll out of a voice with lots of range, none of it homey. Reassuring to hear the heartland Americana of the Band actually inspire a heartlander. Reassuring too that one of the resulting songs can be released as a single by Three Dog Night.

I admit to a weakness for loony lyrical surrealist protest rockers. And I admit that this one tends to go soft when he tries to go poetic. I even admit that he has a voice many would consider worse than no voice at all (although that's one of the charms of the type). But I insist that anyone who can declaim about killing an ant with his guitar ""underneath romantic Indiana stars"" deserves a shot at leading man status in Fort Wayne.

FALSE,B,Two Bit Monsters,John Hiatt,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1779,"
Stupid that they're comparing this perennial future cult hero to Elvis C.--Hiatt beat Costello to his voice, such as it is, by four years. Still, a lyric like ""Back to the War,"" which sounds bitterly political and was probably inspired by an errant lover or business associate, makes me think twice, as does the impenetrable ""New Numbers."" When Costello is impenetrable, which is usually, he makes it look clever. And when Hiatt is penetrable, which is also usually, his cleverness varies.
"
FALSE,B,Warming Up to the Ice Age,John Hiatt,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1782,"
Commercial failure hasn't touched Hiatt's devotion to craft, but it's been hell on his sense of humor. He still cracks wise while rolling out the hooks, but the sprightly feel of Riding With the King has given way to a soulish hard rock that suggests he's satirizing all these bitter macho men in the first person because satire isn't the main idea.

If Hicks's acoustic stylings react against the excesses of counterculture futurists, then the key moment on this live album comes when he corrects ""his wife"" with ""I should say old lady"" and no one laughs. Hicks is delicate, tuneful, and droll, with an ear for colloquial history in words and music both, but he's so diffident about focus that his mock nostalgia is too easy to mistake for the right thing.

On Where's the Money? I had to work to figure out why I wasn't responding; on this one I have to think to figure out why I am. Well, dozens of touches--Hicks's musical wit is undiminished, with John Girton's acoustic plectra especially charming. But the words aren't sharp enough to cut the band's chronic cuteness.

Despite one soupy instrumental, one soupy hit, and one soupy song of putative faith, the general air of unrelieved vapidity here only enhances yet another bright, slick, well-crafted album by our own Five Lads. Funniest conceit: ""Please Sign Your Letters."" Best readymade: Booker T. bottom on ""Do You Believe in Love?""

FALSE,B,Alleged in Their Own Time,Holy Modal Rounders,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1539,"
I love the Rounders chronicle and the theory of Western civ and the pornographic reminiscence but I wish there were times and credits in the liner notes too because I don't feel like putting a watch on what I estimate as fifty-plus minutes of random canon and also because I wonder whether Steve Weber and maybe Luke Faust and Robin Remailly are putting out and in addition I prefer Dave Van Ronk's ""Random Canyon"" to Peter Stampfel's and would just as soon Peter recut ""Nova"" and ""Synergy"" as well but he probably designed the album to sound like a field recording which I'm sure is just what the Folks-with-a-capital-F at the Rounder collective wanted since this isn't traditional enough for them and maybe it's also too traditional for me but I doubt it.

FALSE,B,Cracked Rear View,Hootie and the Blowfish,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1543,"
Even when they split the difference between jangle and boogie, bands given to blunt popcraft and elementary guitars generally favor singers up toward the whiny end of the dramatic spectrum. So Darius Rucker's gruff grit adds an extra layer of substance to a music already deeply comforting in its formal certainties. As a black man who takes his vocal cues from what Gregg Allman made of blues and soul, not to mention a black man embraced as eagerly as Carl McCall by white people loath to think of themselves as ""prejudiced,"" he's significant, with ""Drowning"" one more hit about racism than Tupac or Dr. Dre has bothered with. But since both patterns can be traced to late minstrelsy--by which I mean not the whiteskin brainwash of perfervid radical rhetoric, merely the twisted roots of American pop--he's hardly unprecedented. And whatever his significance, a cornball is a cornball is a cornball.
"
FALSE,B,Human Fly,The Horseflies,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4979,"
You can tell these sardonic folkies have big plans because they've come up with a slogan: ""neoprimitive bug music,"" which definitely beats ""the Ithaca sound."" Overimpressed with Philip Glass, bluegrass, or both, they utilize lots of repetition. Very hypnotic, or strophic, or static. Also kind of tedious, like the grim life-cycle they so often evoke--a little goes a long way, which I guess beats nowhere. Check out the Cramps cover.

FALSE,B,Hot,Hot,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7034,"
Vocally, this group can't match the Emotions, and the music for some of these songs is undistinguished, but I'll take their hit (""Angel in Your Arms,"" not to be confused with ""Undercover Angel"") for its modestly articulate modern moralism, a virtue many of the lyrics here share. Recommended: ""Mama's Girl,"" ""You Can Do It.""

FALSE,B,Every 1's a Winner,Hot Chocolate,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1550,"
Errol Brown used to pose interesting questions, mostly about race, and though his conclusions were often quizzical or incoherent, they tended to be more provocative (if no more militant) than ""Love Is the Answer One More Time."" There are four good songs here and no utter losers, but one of the good ones is already on 10 Greatest Hits, and only ""Confetti Day,"" another installment in this strange group's family series, is up to the title chartbuster. Maybe that's because the question that really interests Brown these days is how to integrate synthesized percussion into English soul-pop.
"
FALSE,B,Mystery,Hot Chocolate,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1552,"
Maybe the reason Errol Brown's never broken through Stateside is the inscrutability that's always made him such a provocative pop figure--he gives you nothing to hold on to but the hook. And though his hooks have never been more abundant, I'm beginning to wish I knew why he took so much trouble.

Meri St. Mary may not be the cross between Lou and Patti her label claims, but she's at least a female Bob Pfeifer, with nice sharp words--""Wild wimmin don't die/They just dye their hair/And get on out of town,"" or ""Doesn't he know that we'd still like him/Even if he was one of the Rolling Stones?""--to go with the nice sharp Lou/Patti arrangements.

Black up the leader's cuspids and change their name to Garageland or London Calling and they could play any tribute bar between Boston and D.C. Only difference is they write their own anthems and don't fake any Cockney--when you start out in German, singing English is tribute enough. And though they won't make you love it, I bet they could make you like it--there's more spirit in their frank, admiring imitation than in the ersatz originality of whichever hybrid is tearing out the alternative playlists this week.

FALSE,B,Ian Hunter,Ian Hunter,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1583,"
""Once Bitten Twice Shy"" and ""I Get So Excited"" are rockers as primo as any but the greatest Mott the Hoople songs, and as a bonus the latter is about something besides rock and roll. Hunter and coproducer Mick Ronson's passion for that subject is justified by the rest of the music, even the poetry-with-rock episode. But Ian should remember that it's a mighty long way down rock and roll, because as your name gets hot your heart gets cold. Then your name gets cold.

FALSE,B,You're Never Alone With a Schizophrenic,Ian Hunter,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1584,"
Six winners out of nine on this mini-comeback, and he doesn't seem to be straining, either. But that's not entirely a blessing--the musical territory is conventionally good-rockin', and only on the gnomic ""Life After Death"" and the second verse of ""When the Morning Comes"" does he reconnoiter lyrically. The titles of the bad songs--""Bastard,"" ""The Outsider,"" and ""Ships"" (in the guess what)--are warning enough.

Us snockgrass fans didn't await this long-awaited album quite long enough--sounds as if Hurley padded over to the studio before he was done with his nap. I know it's always sleepy time up north in Wolfville, and Hurley obviously spent part of his four-year vacation thinking about seven new originals. But except for the . . . climactic ""Open Up (Eternal Lips),"" even the best of them get lost on their way to the outhouse. Inspirational Insert: ""Feel free to tape this album: Blue Navigator is not soley [sic] a commercial venture but is intended for a spiritual life far out traveling the destination of one arrow.""

FALSE,B,Rhyme Pays,Ice-T,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1590,"
With heavy help from DJ Afrika Islam, this reformed criminal is the rap equivalent of pimp-turned-paperback-writer Iceberg Slim. Can't know whether his streetwise jabs at Reagan and recidivism will make a permanent impression on his core audience, but his sexploitations and true crime tales are detailed and harrowing enough to convince anybody he was there. Wish I was sure he'll never go back.

Don't stop for ""Don't Stop"" or touch ""The Untouchables,"" but ""Dancing With Myself"" is DOR's theme song, and ""Mony Mony"" works almost as well as it did for his great preceptor Tommy James. Would Billy were as principled, but these are cynical times, and they like Billy just the way he is.

FALSE,B,Billy Idol,Billy Idol,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4993,"
Even in punk's heyday he obviously wanted to be a teen idol, but back then he couldn't very well admit that his hero was Elton John. Yet here he is with Kiss's manager and an album that rocks as hard as the first side of Caribou--for three cuts, including a hit single and ""White Wedding,"" a call to innocence regained as desperate and persuasive as ""Start Me Up."" If he could keep it going I'd be happy to buy my pop from a phony, but neither Burundi beats nor overzealous voice practice do anything but accentuate the jaded professionalism that takes over.

FALSE,B,Machination,Ignition,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4998,"
It's a mild up to run into the old hardcore idealism, and somehow no surprise that the singer's brother to the producer, too-idealistic-for-this-world straight-edge avatar Ian MacKaye. The lyrics avoid the excesses of hardcore rant and posthardcore doubt without rejecting the truth of either--or equalling the evolutionary smarts of the guitar. Attack's tough, minimal, fast but no longer speedy. High points are slow side-closers: ""Strain"" with its honest struggle and pain, ""Lucky Thirteen"" with its Flipper refrain.

FALSE,B,Lifestyles of the Roach and Famous,Incorporated Thang Band,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1610,"
After laying low for a couple of years, George Clinton enlists a new bunch of unsuspecting young people into P-Funk Mark VIII (Plus or Minus III), so say ho. His mid-'80s electrowhomp is in place, and the catchy lounge-rocker wasn't stolen from the Main Ingredient or somebody. But with ""jack"" the keyword and ""chiropracter"" and ""androgynous"" the polysyllables, he never comes up with the catchphrase that reestablishes his street connection--not even a ""Do fries go with that shake?"" Which may be why the electrowhomp shows its technics.

"
FALSE,B,Love's So Tough,Iron City Houserockers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7053,"
""Turn It Up"" is one of those self-transcending cliches--a song about rock and roll escape that reveals how the truism became one. Most of the others are honorable cliches--working-class angst played for tragedy rather than irony or analysis in the great tradition of B. Springsteen. Or is it T. Lizzy?
"
FALSE,B,I.O.U.,Gregory Isaacs,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5015,"
Isaacs evolves so slowly that he'll still be catching up with pop history when he's 70, which makes keeping up with him less fun than quality music ought to be. Like Smokey, he's given up on songwriting and production, yet musically he's deeper now than five years ago: when Gussie Clarke tells him to lead with an unskanking soul-ballad groove, he gets into it no questions asked--like he owns it. Politically, however, he's disappeared, and since one of his charms was how naturally he yoked resistance and romance, he falls on just the wrong side of the almost imperceptible margin between the crafty and the generic. Though if Clarke had come up with more sound effects like the warbling electronic cricket hiding in the underbrush of ""Report to Me,"" I'd never think to mention it.
"
FALSE,B,Silvertone,Chris Isaak,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5016,"
Like his East Coast counterpart Marshall Crenshaw, Isaak comes to his sources as a professional musician, not a bohemian dabbler. This is attractive, only his sources aren't as rich as Crenshaw's, and neither is his talent. Reflective modernized rockabilly played for echoing atmosphere.
"
FALSE,B,Chris Isaak,Chris Isaak,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=595,"
For me, the almost genteel formalism and romanticism of this dreamy foray into rockabilly's dark, hurtful, sensitive side is epitomized by the fiddle-as-violin that adds its sad color deep behind ""Fade Away."" Don't get me wrong, it sounds good. Whole damn thing sounds good. 
"
FALSE,B,Ain't No Backin' Up Now,Isis,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7054,"
On their Shadow Morton-produced debut this brassy ten-woman ensemble sounded like a cross between Vanilla Fudge and the Mount St. Mary's College Lab Band, but here Allen Toussaint's horn arrangements cut a channel for their melodrama. As is usual on Toussaint albums, the side that features his songs is a lot stronger than the side that features the band's. Now if only he could describe lesbian life as knowledgeably as Carol MacDonald in ""Bobbie and Maria"" or Jeanie Fineberger in ""Eat the Root."" But that would be a lot to ask.
"
FALSE,B,Get into Something,The Isley Brothers,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7055,"
Five of the ten tracks on this album were r&amp;b hits, and even ""Girls Will Be Girls,"" a silly song that does not reflect ""Take Inventory""'s astonishing views on the subjection of women, has its pleasures. But none of them went pop--or tore up the r&amp;b charts--because none of them was more than a serviceable rehash. The first side rocks, the second side fluctuates, and let's hope they get into something else soon.
"
FALSE,B,Givin' It Back,The Isley Brothers,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7057,"
An exciting album in theory--cover versions by a genuinely ""progressive"" (at least self-contained) soul act of eight (mostly) excellent (mostly) rock songs. But only ""Spill the Wine"" (previously a progressive r&amp;b hit), ""Love the One You're With"" (previously a progressive rock hit), and ""Ohio"" (no complaints) are exciting in practice. Ernie Isley just can't match Jimi's ""Machine Gun,"" and soul is wasted on ""Fire and Rain"" and ""Lay Lady Lay,"" which are more powerful in their understated originals.
"
FALSE,B,"Brother, Brother, Brother",The Isley Brothers,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7058,"
Although the three Carole King songs seem a little tame after ""Ohio"" and ""Cold Baloney,"" her simple messages fit the Isleys' lyrical-to-smarmy gospel credulousness quite neatly. But it's only on the three Isley originals that top off side one that this album makes itself felt, and interestingly enough none of them could be called ""progressive"": ""Lay Away"" and ""Pop That Thang"" are infectious groove tunes, while ""Work to Do"" is a compelling assertion of male prerogatives whose dire potential was presaged in 1969, when R.B. Greaves found himself forced to swap his wife for his secretary. Love and money, love and money--it's a polarity that tears you apart even more when they give you a (long) shot at both.
"
FALSE,B,Live It Up,The Isley Brothers,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7061,"
In which Ernie finally gets to make his studio album. What sound effects--the most technosoulful around. I mean, this guy isn't just whistling wah-wah. I do believe he likes Stevie's synthesizer more than Jimi's guitar, though.
"
FALSE,B,The Heat Is On,The Isley Brothers,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3658,"
This is well-nigh flawless Isleys--the rockish electric textures are muted nicely on side two, ""Fight the Power"" does its bit to politicize the radio, and Seals &amp; Crofts won't steal any lyrics. But Ronnie Isley isn't getting any less unctuous--when he tries to talk someone into bed he recalls one of those guys who started wearing love beads to singles bars in 1968 or 1969. Progress requires ambition, but the two aren't identical.
"
FALSE,B,Go For Your Guns,The Isley Brothers,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3659,"
By the time the competent enough first side was over, I felt completely fed up with their mellifluous bullshit, especially since I'd noticed the title ""Voyage to Atlantis"" on side two. But that disaster excepted side two is the most hard-edged they've recorded since moving T-Neck to CBS in 1973. Needless to say, the one about ""Climbin' Up the Ladder"" is even more passionate than the one about ""Livin' the Life."" Nor is it surprising that the title tune has no lyrics at all. There's no riot goin' on.
"
FALSE,B,Showdown,The Isley Brothers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7064,"
Disco has been good for this band musically: the chic guitar-and-chant of the title tune, the slow, sensuous funk of ""Groove With You,"" and the enigmatic air of ""Ain't Givin' Up No Love"" are refreshing variants on their basic moon-and-vroom, and both ""Rockin' the Fire"" and ""Take Me to the Next Phase"" are pure dance-peak ideology. Doesn't do much for their politics, though.

To compare the latest platinum love man to Marvin Gaye is to ignore his voice. If Luther Vandross relaxed more and (what may be the same thing) sold himself love man first and singer second, this is how he'd sound. A pure make-out record--mellow groove, mellow sound. Just lie back and enjoy it.

FALSE,B,Control,Janet Jackson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5023,"
I scoffed at Janet's claims of autonomy--figured Jam &amp; Lewis wrote her in as collaborator for a price she could afford. But she must have had some input--otherwise what would be not to like? Great beats here, their deepest ever. If her voice ever changes, she may even live up to them--and convince the world she's her own woman. Till then she's just playing, which does have its entertainment value.

FALSE,B,Look Sharp!,Joe Jackson,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1734,"
In which an up-and-coming professional entertainer tricks up Britain's latest rock and roll fashion with some fancy chords and gets real intense about the perils of romance. Well, better ""Is She Really Going Out with Him?"" than ""Sunday Papers,"" the social-criticism interlude, which inspires fond memories of ""Pleasant Valley Sunday.""

FALSE,B,Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive,Joe Jackson,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5028,"
Put this on the shelf in front of Bowie's Pin Ups, Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll, and Costello's Almost Blue. Granted, Jackson doesn't sing as well as any of them, not to mention Cab Calloway or Louis Jordan, who originated most of the '50s r&amp;b novelties here revived. But he obviously gets a kick out of this stuff, and that counts for something. What counts for much much more is that MCA has slipped three budget Louis Jordan compilations into better record stores.
"
FALSE,B,Beat Crazy,Joe Jackson Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5027,"
Just in case Jackson is about to turn into last year's model for good, I thought I'd mention that I kind of like his poorest-selling album. The melodies escape me as usual, but the beat is getting tougher and more resilient and the lyrics are at their best. Granted, the social comment and romantic reflections still sound smug at times, but anybody who can justify a dedication to Linton Kwesi Johnson (""Battleground"") and say something new about fooling-around-on-the-road (""Biology"") hasn't thrown it in yet.
"
FALSE,B,It Hurts So Good,Millie Jackson,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7080,"
A hint of concept brings the tracks on this album together--on side one she's playing up to her man, while on side two she's playing around--and the production mixes (alternates, really) Holland-Dozier-Holland and Norman Whitfield, with guest Brad Shapiro adding the occasional modernism, all of which makes for instructive contrasts with Jackson's definitely unsubtle attack. But if there isn't a bad track on the record, there isn't a compelling one either, and in pop that's the kiss of obscurity if anything is.
"
FALSE,B,Feelin' Bitchy,Millie Jackson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7084,"
Fuck this ten-pop-tunes shit, Millie says. Almost literally--the FCC will not approve. She's appealing more explicitly to her black audience, too, and has apparently returned to concepts--or rather, messages, two of them. The second side says ""Don't cheat"" and the first side says ""Eat pussy."" The first side is definitely more fun.
"
FALSE,B,For Men Only,Millie Jackson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5035,"
This starts with a bang--Millie's unemployed husband hits her. And for a while she runs with it, giving no quarter to either side in the sexual war. But then the plot blurs over into an ill-conceived affair that only heats up when Millie says no. She's very good at saying no. She's not such a hot ballad singer.
"
FALSE,B,I Had to Say It,Millie Jackson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5036,"
Who better to do a rap parody--a damn funny one first few times through, closes with MJ invited into the KKK. I like the infidelity-on-the-road piece, too, and note that much of side two--""I Ain't No Glory Story,"" the Philip Mitchell duet, ""Ladies First"" (and you'd better last)--tops For Men Only. But either Millie's growing weary of her shtick or we are--she sounds bone tired.
"
FALSE,B,Lookin' Through the Windows,Jackson 5,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7071,"
They're wonders of nature no longer, but they're still a good group, and this snaps back toward the usual marvelous Motown multiplex. Jackson Browne's specifically late-adolescent ""Doctor My Eyes"" brings Michael along too fast, but it sounds good on the radio. And Jermaine (I think) proves equal to Ashford &amp; Simpson's specifically adult ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing."" Recommended ballad: ""If I Could Move a Mountain."" Continuing a great tradition: ""E-Ne-Me-Ne-Mi-Ne-Moe.""
"
FALSE,B,All Mod Cons,The Jam,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3666,"
Far from the posers cynics believe them to be, these guys are almost painfully sincere, and on this album their desire to write commercial songs that say something is palpable and winning. Unfortunately, their success is mixed at best, and the music is so tentative that I was surprised by how hard they made a set of new material rock in concert. But last year's set rocked even harder. And though I can overlook the record's gaffes and forced lines and faint playing in the aftermath of the show, I'm too much of a cynic to believe the glow will last.
"
FALSE,B,The Jam,The Jam,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5056,"
There are two theories about these guys--one that they're getting better, the other that they're getting worse. As you might fear, this interim product (""5 British Hit Singles,"" boasts the sticker, so imagine how excited they are in Britain) proves both--songwriting up, punk excitement gone forever.
"
FALSE,B,The Gift,The Jam,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5057,"
It's easy to understand why this is Britannia's favorite band--their dedication is very winning. Nobody plays ex-punk quasifunk with less ostentation or more skill, and Paul Weller goes Springsteen one better--not only is he working-class, he's young. As usual, his good-heartedness is palpable here. He takes on suburban racism, nine-to-five fatigue, even general strike without talking down or claiming exemption from sin. And if he's written half a dozen good melodies since he stopped settling for Who hand-me-downs, three of them have passed me by.
"
FALSE,B,The Bitterest Pill,The Jam,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5058,"
Fan fodder there, where Paul Weller is a god; cult fodder here, where he's an artist. It made sense for him to revive a Pete Townshend obscurity on his previous EP-in-waiting, and the arty horn and bassline touches on the evergreen ""War"" are not without interest. But only worshippers want his ""Fever."" In fact, agnostics aren't sure about the title tune either.
"
FALSE,B,Stutter,James,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5059,"
These Lancashire lads have staked out their own kitchen garden on guitar-bass-and-drums' densely cultivated common. Folkedelic with hints of postpunk-pop, it's a place pleasant, unkempt, and all their own, but not private enough to suit them--hence their wry, well-meaning, angst-ridden, and ultimately impenetrable lyrics.
"
FALSE,B,Etta James Sings Funk,Etta James,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7091,"
As you can read on the back, funk isn't a style or something like that--it's just, well, Etta. Etta with chorus, Etta with full brass, Etta with strings even. Etta singing a Gershwin song, Etta singing a Bee Gees song, Etta singing three Acuff-Rose songs, Etta singing four Pearl Woods songs. (Pearl Woods?) Highlights: the Acuff-Rose songs.

Gabriel Mekler (of Steppenwolf, Kozmic Janis, Nolan Porter) introduces Etta to the rock audience with three Randy Newman covers plus, and it almost works. To hear this gospel-trained ex-junkie turn ""God's Song"" into a jubilantly sarcastic antihymn is to know why pious blacks consider blues devil music, and Tracy Nelson fans should hear how low ""Down So Low"" can get. James is full-bodied, bitter, hip without sounding educated about it. But she has trouble finding a female persona for ""Sail Away"" and ""Leave Your Hat On."" And she has trouble making anything at all out of Mekler's own stuff.

FALSE,B,Etta Is Betta Than Evvah!,Etta James,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7095,"
What a mess. The side-openers--""Woman (Shake Your Booty)"" (she's dirty and she's proud) and ""Jump Into Love"" (""You gotta wallow in it,"" opines a lowdown male chorus)--promise an album of raunch after all that classy stuff. But except for a literal version of King Floyd's ""Groove Me,"" the only other raunch here is Randy Newman's ""Leave Your Hat On,"" which Mekler originally produced.

FALSE,B,Deep in the Night,Etta James,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7096,"
Most of James's albums suffer from radical unevenness; this one is marred by its consistency. Producer Jerry Wexler's song choices are as tastefully imaginative as his arrangements, but James has never had much midrange, and her versions of (good) material from such luminaries as Kiki Dee, the Eagles, and Alice Cooper are inferior to the originals. She doesn't get much out of ""Piece of My Heart,"" either. That said, I'll admit to enjoying side two--opening with a jaunty ""Lovesick Blues"" and touching base at gospel (Dorothy Love Coates), soul (Allen Toussaint), and r&amp;b (revamping her own ""I'd Rather Go Blind""). But it's still a little boring. Which means it's not the real Etta.

FALSE,B,Treasure Island,Keith Jarrett,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11685,"
If Jarrett's Solo Concerts are too statusy and static, then this moves with a suspiciously unambitious ease--it's true to all its own assumptions, only it assumes too little. When he is on (e.g., Fort Yawuh) Jarrett can conjure beauty out of chaos and agitation out of peace. All he comes up with here is pleasant little surges of melody.

Jarrett has the kind of gift that is labeled genius because it's so hard to put down. But for a genius, he makes an awful lot of music that can best be described as pleasant. Granted that its pleasantness is substantial and sensual and spirited all at once. Granted too that the accomplishment of this album is more reliable than that of his last group effort, Treasure Island. I still expect more from a genius.

The consumerist-conservationist in me is appalled by the whole idea of J.B.'s records, which are basically another way for James Brown to spread himself thin. The title riff is the best he's come up with since There It Is--two soundtracks, a compilation, a studio double, and another J.B.'s album ago--and might have been put to better use elsewhere. On the other hand, the whole first side is adequate James Brown--that is, pretty damn good. The second side stretches Brown out on organ, never my favorite vehicle for his talent. Theme song: ""You Can Have Watergate Just Gimme Some Bucks and I'll Be Straight."" Lot of different ways to take that.

FALSE,B,Early Flight,Jefferson Airplane,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7108,"
Artists are always claiming embarrassment at the unauthorized release of their early work, but this group owns the company, so I guess they know no shame. They ought to--not about these nine cuts, six recorded in 1965-66 and three in 1970, but at how played out the band has become. The two originals with Signe Anderson are early Airplane at their folkie-trippy worst, although ""High Flying Bird"" is fine, but even the six-minute blues jams, one with Jorma and one with Marty, sound more alive than all their space operas. The 1970 single ""Mexico,"" about Nixon's dope crackdown, is their finest recording of the decade. And ""Have You Seen the Saucers,"" the B side, sounds more alive than all their space operas too.

Jeffreys has never shown much knack for love songs, and he's not getting any better with melodies either, which means that half of this encouraging comeback gets by on his acumen as a singer and bandleader. But as you might expect from somebody who rhymes ""you know what it's like"" with ""Wilhelm Reich,"" he retains his feeling for cafe society and his sense of the street, which synthesize into his eternal theme of making it. And while you might suspect him of sentimentalizing the street kids on the cover, he doesn't--he just cares about them, that's all.

""People my age, 25 to 40, who grew up as Cold War babies, we don't have anybody writing music for us. There's a lot of formula rock aimed at the 11-year-old market, and there's a lot of MOR for people over 50. But this is an album dealing with us, and our American experience--guilt, pressures, relationships, and the whole Vietnam syndrome."" Imagine--in a world where formula rock, MOR, and most of the in between is guilty of association with Billy's (and my) demographic, he talked that shit. OK, you say, so he's no sociologist, and though sociological aptitude does tend to clarify ""experience,"" I'll let it pass. What shocks me is the realization that this consummate rock professional is working on instinct. The basic belief of Cold War babies is that anything less than everything is a cheat, and their piano man agrees. Sure, ""Allentown"" digs into the rust belt. Right, ""Goodnight Saigon"" ain't Rambo. And in the relationship songs, sexual politics rads like me were fretting about a decade ago come home to haunt guys who thought they were a crock. But always this music feeds off a sense of deprivation that transcends specifics--it's built into the psyche of the singer and his audience. Does it help that the John Lennon impression (signifying seriousness) vies with the Paul McCartney impression (signifying entertainment value)? You bet. But he's no less deluded than his audience.

FALSE,B,The Bridge,Billy Joel,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5079,"
Maybe his youthful lyricism, meaning his knack for the tearjerker, is abandoning him. On Greatest Hits ""Just the Way You Are"" and ""She's Always a Woman"" are every bit as alive as ""Movin' Out"" and ""Allentown,"" but here he's best when he's brassy and literal: failed wise guy in ""Big Man on Mulberry Street,"" Ray Charles's coequal on ""Baby Grand."" And even at his most rockin' he's seventy-five years retro whether he likes it or not--whenever he doesn't hit it just right you want to quarantine him for life in Atlantic City.

Instead of going Broadway with his cautionary tales and cornball confessionals, he hires the man from Foreigner. And it makes no difference--even in arena mode he's a force of nature and bad taste.

A lot of people consider John a future superstar, and they may be right; I find this overweening (semi-classical ponderousness) and a touch precious (sensitivity on parade). It offers at least one great lyric (about a newborn baby brother), several nice romantic ballads (I don't like its affected offhandedness, but ""Your Song"" is an instant standard), and a surprising complement of memorable tracks. But their general lack of focus, whether due to histrionic overload or sheer verbal laziness, is a persistent turnoff.

Two LPs ago, Bernie Taupin passed on his way from obscure banality to clean, well-lighted banality to write a batch of imaginative lyrics, and set to those lyrics John's music sounded eclectic but not confused. Too often now it seems to chatter on anonymously. The title cut is good, ""Bennie and the Jets"" is great, side four is good-to-great, and a few other songs here would probably benefit from more exclusive company, but this is one more double album that would make a nifty single.

What's happening to our children when a concept album about the hard times of a songwriting team hits number one on all charts the week it's released?

You say you don't care that it's his best album in seven years? I swear, you young people have no respect. This little guy was a giant, helped keep us sane back then, and though it's true he hasn't come up with a ""Honky Cat"" or ""Bennie and the Jets"" (""I Am Your Robot"" might qualify if there were still AM radio), it's gratifying enough that after all these faithful years he's started to get good songs out of Gary Osborne (gunning for a Frank Sinatra cover on ""Blue Eyes"") as well as Bernie Taupin (who really shouldn't ever write about politics).

The bitch is gone, presumably forever. Never an artist you looked to for aesthetic principle, John provided a nice ersatz hard rock before punk and metal split that alternative down the middle. So he sunk to the depths and then resurfaced as an '80s pop singer. No point comparing him to Springsteen or Costello when he's competing with Barry Manilow, to whom he's infinitely preferable, and Billy Joel, who gets the decision on aesthetic principle. His only classic of the period is ""Sad Songs (Say So Much),"" which is much faster than most of these hits. It's not especially sad, either--and ""I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues"" isn't a blues.

Johns is a local hero, a rock and roll crazy who lives for the music and whose undeniable gift doesn't do justice to the magnitude of his devotion. After years of fringe rockabilly in D.C., relocating to Austin has brought out the Doug Sahm in him. On ""guitars, vox organ, lap steel, upright and electric bass, slide, harmonica, and lead vocals,"" he rolls out tune after generically catchy tune in his somewhat raspy drawl. Most of them are about purty girls and hellacious wimmin, but I can't even claim he deserves the latter, because the specifics just aren't there--the words are unfailingly good-humored and never anything more, including funny. My favorite cut is an instrumental named after its entire lyric, ""Hey Whew!,"" but those so enamored of authenticity that they fake it can fool their collector fans by covering ""Life Sentence in Love"" or ""Love Is Murder"" or ""Moonshine Runner"" or ""My Baby, She Left Me.""

Note label, imagine formula. A good one, of course--as the horns ascend over bass and drums you half expect him to break into ""You Ought to Be With Me"" or ""Here I Am."" Unfortunately, the voice is too narrow and nasal to take full advantage of such a smooth approach--good thing he gets gritty now and then. Mistake: Jerry Vale's (and Ray Charles's) ""You Don't Know Me,"" which sounds like something Al thought better of.

One of the artiest cover illustrations ever to come out of Nashville has misled casual observers into the belief that this is a concept album about George and Tammy's marital problems. What it is is a slightly better-than-average George Jones LP marred by a surfeit of conjugal-bliss songs.

The vocals aren't as intense here as on Alone Again, so the tomfoolery seems a little forced, though I hope he keeps trying.

This not-great George Jones record should reassure anybody who was worried he'd never make another decent one without hitting the bottle again. First side leads off with messages to wives of various periods, second with a Jones-penned chestnut that happens to be the title of his new bio, a great pseudofolksong (or maybe it's real, which is what makes it great), and a very cheerful explanation of why he'll never hit the bottle again.

If it's amazing that this inexhaustible record machine has never resorted to a live quickie, it's doubly amazing that he's never dared one. Less amazing is the career moment it captures, the period of sobriety that's turned his never-ending stage fright into shtick. ""No Show Jones"" opens the show, naturally, and this being country music it kicks off with his guitarist's Merle Haggard imitation. Elsewhere there's a set-down-a-spell band feature, a get-it-over-with medley, and the usual quota of you-had-to-be-there cornball, which Jones, whose stage fright isn't altogether irrational, delivers pretty clumsily for a thirty-year-man. And on top of it all there's irrefutable proof of how instinctive his tricks and mannerisms are--you've heard these vocal grimaces and bursts of prose poetry before, but never in just these heart-stopping places. Definitive: ""He Stopped Loving Her Today.""

Seeking airplay worthy of Bonnie Raitt if not Linda Ronstadt, Don Dixon slows Jones down a little, to less than no avail--the airplay has failed to materialize (or whatever airplay does), and the tempos reveal the reluctance of perfectly hooky modern songwriters to say something and/or the inability of a perfectly attentive modern interpreter to make you ignore it.

She's got her feet on the ground, with a warm simple song about motherhood and a cracked blues about addiction the signposts, but everywhere there are images of flight--as something heroes do, as something she used to do, as something she still can do in her mind. For anyone who never bought her effusions, the music is an advance--grounded as well, from studio-rock four to white-reggae depth charge to the guitars and synths of that blues.

The musical and political strengths and weaknesses of apartheid-fighters Johnny Clegg and Sipho Mchuna are best understood if you think of them as folkies. Beginning as a biracial guitar-and-voice duo committed to Zulu traditionalism, which many apartheid-fighters consider objectively counterrevolutionary, they've become a rock band out of commercial happenstance. Like most folkies, they're often corny--""Simple things are all we have left to trust"" and so forth. But being a folkie in South Africa takes a lot more guts than it does in liberal societies, and that's audible all over this album--as are the melodic resources of the Zulu tradition, which happen to be vocal rather than percussive.

The Stevie Wonder surrogate that vocalist-songwriter Junior Giscombe and keyboardist-producer Bob Carter have synthesized in their London studio is certainly England's most impressive recent export, but it does lack the effervescence and spacy lyricism of the real thing.

At his best, Kahn writes like the gifted local organizer he still is sometimes; his political commitment is bound up in the incidents that precede issues. But his modest folkie renown seems to have cut him off from his sources in much the way that superstardom starves pop genius at the root. With one exception (El Salvador as seen by a farmboy-turned-soldier), the best songs here are the most personal: two for the new love of his life, one for a gay coworker. The political stuff is often generalized, conceived to serve an idea, and while he gets away with it sometimes (an antiharassment song that kicks off from the turn-of-the-century ""It's the Same the Whole World Over""--smart), he does seem to think that ""It's not how large your share is/But how much you can share"" is an inspirational couplet.

As he showed those few who heard the sole U.S. release by his Ivory Coast-based Ambassadeurs (on Rounder in 1984), this albino Mali nobleman is one of Africa's great singers. Like his Senegalese neighbor Youssou N'Dour, he's Francophone with Islamic projection, and like anybody this side of Jackie Wilson he falls short of N'Dour's purity and range. But he's old enough to compensate with experience, by which I mean not savvy but feeling and authority. And now, his ambassadorial ambitions largely thwarted, he's making his world pop move solo, recording in Paris with French musicians black and white. Though there's nothing as awkward as the ""Rubberband Man"" N'Dour committed with similar intentions, the arrangements sacrifice a quantum of groove for dramatic effects that wouldn't sound out of place on an Elton John record, and wouldn't wash there either.

But his two '60s hits proved novelty one-shots (or two-shots) and his manic intensity proved impossible to sell. Here they finally let him do a rocking country album that may or may not appeal to the rocking country market, by which I do not mean the outlaw market--I'm talking about a market too small to make him a star. ""It Takes All Day"" is a minor hit, ""Blow Your Horn"" and ""I'm Not Strong Enough"" deserve to follow, and the filler is inoffensive, proving only (outlaws take note) that those who act macho are more appealing if they also act a little nuts.

On the contrary, she goes for melismatic pain whenever she sees an opening. But this is formal ploy merely, a diva-by-default's privilege. Her true self comes out in the half-heartedly relentless ""Wait Til You See My Smile,"" a stab at the chin-up franchise once claimed by a young Mariah Carey, and the first thing newcomers will notice even though it's the last track on the album: an inspirational, evasive ""Empire State of Mind"" sequel that establishes Jay-Z's vocal and spiritual superiority so decisively it's hard to imagine her ever attending a Yankees game again.

Arif Mardin and the usual En Why studio funkies lay down a heavier bottom for Ms. Rufus than her El Lay street bottom for Ms. Rufus than her El Lay street players have in years. She's expressing herself by looking for songs, too, but while every one gives her something to say, only Ashford &amp; Simpson's ""I'm Every Woman"" is up to her human potential.

FALSE,B,Destiny,Chaka Khan,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5134,"
Though supervising producer Arif Mardin lends an appearance of unity to the credits, the eight-count-'em-eight coproducers take it away, leaving yet another candid concatenation of crossover wannabees. Those who treasure Chaka's quirkiness will object--the Coltrane snippet's an obvious sop. Those who've always found her unfocused will admire the professional standard of Osborne, LaBelle, etc. while dreaming of a whole album with Scritti Politti.

FALSE,B,What's This For . . . !,Killing Joke,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5138,"
Not so strange that these heavy-metal mutants should turn up on the ambient-music label. In fact, their all-over sound is a plus--better echoey vocals and flash-free guitar than the stupid doomsday strut of their forefathers. But I rarely crave ambient technohorror, even when it has lead drum parts--prefer my immolation with lines around it. Which is why I bought ""Change"" as a single, and hope to do the same with ""Tension."" DNA goes to a par-tee.

FALSE,B,Completely Well,B.B. King,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10973,"
A year ago I thought B.B. was the best live act there was and treasured several of his lps, notably Live at the Regal. Since then he has been transformed by astute management into the major attraction he should have been 10 years ago, and I hope he makes two million, but his music is not improving. There's no reason why someone as sweet-voiced as B.B. shouldn't cut his blues with ballads, but his ballad-singing is just plain schmaltzy--the taste that serves him so exquisitely in blues betrays him when he tries to be tasty. This record is good enough, especially the first side. But Live at the Regal is so much better.

FALSE,B,Indianola Mississippi Seeds,B.B. King,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7176,"
I hate to sound like a fuddy-duddy, but the best moment here is unaccompanied--""Nobody Loves Me but My Mother,"" all 1:26 of it, with King singing and playing piano. B.B. King, that is--most of the piano here is by Carole King, who sounds fine, as do Leon Russell and Paul Harris. Even the strings and horns avoid disaster--B.B. goes pop with real dignity. But he's rarely brilliant, and the only songs on this record with a chance of being in his show a year from now are ""Chains and Things"" and Leon Russell's ""Hummingbird,"" hooked on the deathless line ""She's little and she loves me."" I mean, what good does it do to perform that kind of tripe with dignity?

FALSE,B,B.B. King in London,B.B. King,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7177,"
Overlooking Alexis Korner's acoustic boogie, this encounter with Brit second-liners (famed blues devotee Ringo Starr is the big catch) and L.A. session stars is substantial stuff. ""Caldonia"" and ""Ain't Nobody Home"" are more than that. But rock with a steady roll it doesn't. Maybe Klaus Voorman, listed on bass, knows why.

In which B.B. and the Crusaders cut room for a party between sincere schlock and pseudo purism. The King's voice hasn't regained its edge and his guitar is used mostly to decorate Joe Sample's tunes, but this would rate as a mini-comeback if it included another song as good as ""Never Make a Move Too Soon,"" the only one on the album that Sample didn't help write.

FALSE,B,Carole King: Writer,Carole King,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7187,"
I liked these musicians better when they called themselves the City--seemed to protect them against string arrangements, folkie jazz, and other exurban excrescences. Must admit, though, that the first side is a lot more eloquent, confident, and tuneful than the nice little album the City put out in 1968. Now if only the Drifters cover on the second side had some company--the reason I'm listening, after all, is that she also wrote hits for the Chiffons, the Shirelles, Little Eva, . . .
"
FALSE,B,Fantasy,Carole King,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7190,"
The title means she's decided to step outside herself and write songs about imaginary situations, just like some Brill Building hack. A decision which seems to have brightened her music considerably. As for the situations themselves, well, what hath Walter Lippmann wrought? But the odd thing is that in the context of her junkie and housewife soap operas, her quest for ""Directions"" and ""A Quiet Place to Live"" could almost make you ""Believe in Humanity."" I said almost.

This is as close as this chronically interesting group has ever come to a good album, or maybe it's as close as Robert Fripp has ever come to dominating this chronically interesting group. As usual, things improve markedly when nobody's singing. The lyrics are relatively sharp, but there must be better ways of proving you're not a wimp than casting invective at a ""health-food faggot."" Unless you are a wimp, that is.

FALSE,B,Discipline,King Crimson,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5142,"
It's amazing how somebody who gabs as much as Robert Fripp gets fucked up by words. Maybe he's afraid to take on a real singer because he knows singers take over bands. So he hires Adrian Belew, who between his David Byrne impressions and his John Wetton impressions and his man-in-the-studio candid-microphone shtick damn near takes over anyway. Musically, not bad--the Heads meet the League of Gentlemen, although I wish the valiant Bill Bruford knew as much about rhythm as John Chernoff. But throw away that thesaurus.

Lenny Wolf's brainchildren share a selling point with the guys they rip so shamelessly: shamelessness. I'm not curious enough to ascertain which Zep songs provide which hook riffs, but that doesn't mean I can't lay back and enjoy a musical force as musical form--a humongous abstraction perfect for flattening the medulla oblongata.

FALSE,B,King Floyd,King Floyd,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11711,"
This is virtually the only good soul music to come from Atlantic in recent memory, which must mean something, probably not good. A standard solid soul LP, nothing ruinous and a couple of good singles to get off on.

FALSE,B,Well Done,King Floyd,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7204,"
Floyd's quiet, chocolatey voice--cf. Lee Dorsey, Aaron Neville--is prized by seekers after the New Orleans dispensation, but he's never grooved me without skipping like a cheap bootleg. So I'm pleased to report that side one of his fourth LP, climaxing with the neglected regional hit ""I Feel Like Dynamite,"" provides songs as winsome as the straight-ahead Caribbeanisms (even some reggae) of the New Orleans r&amp;b behind. Location of studio: Jackson, Mississippi.

FALSE,B,A Shade of Red,Redhead Kingpin and the F.B.I.,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5146,"
Proud Jeffersons fan, casual abortion foe, his stupid fresh showing the occasional expiration date, this Englewood eclectic stores his brains somewhere near his ass, where his beats do his thinking for him--first couple of cuts'll have you bopping so happy all you'll care is that he doesn't stammer or sass your mama. Both were mixed and arranged by Teddy Riley, whose salutary effect on Red's mind-body continuum is evinced by his alternating presence and absence throughout.
"
FALSE,B,Misfits,The Kinks,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7215,"
Ray Davies hasn't put so many hummable melodies in one place since Everybody's in Showbiz (just to make sure, he's put a couple of them both places), and the lyrics evince renewed thought and craft. All of which makes his congenital parochialism and ressentiment seem surprisingly fresh and vivid. Dismaying: ""Black Messiah""--Enoch Powell would be proud.
"
FALSE,B,Dressed to Kill,Kiss,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7216,"
I feel schizy about this record. It rocks with a brutal, uncompromising force that's very impressive--sort of a slicked-down, tightened-up, heavied-out MC5--and the songwriting is much improved from albums one and two. But the lyrics recall the liberal fantasy of rock concert as Nuremberg rally, equating sex with victimization in a display of male supremacism that glints with humor only at its cruelest--song titles like ""Room Service"" and ""Ladies in Waiting."" In this context, the band's refusal to bare the faces that lie beneath the clown makeup becomes ominous, which may be just what they intend, though for the worst of reasons. You know damn well that if they didn't have both eyes on maximum commerciality they'd call themselves Blow Job.

If Knight is the golden mean of female soul, here she could use some burnishing. From the hits through the covers to the fillers she turns in a more than creditable job, but only on a slow version of ""For Once in My Life"" do you feel she couldn't go a little deeper. You'd think she was planning to leave her label.
"
FALSE,B,Imagination,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7222,"
Damn right ""Midnight Train to Georgia"" is a great single, but that's no reason to devote an album to the wit and wisdom of Jim Weatherly. Weatherly's stuff does beat out the two Pips showcases, though--a transparently hokey ""I Can See Clearly Now"" and a song about Granny's window designed to recall the one about Daddy's mouth.
"
FALSE,B,Visions,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5153,"
Accurately acclaimed as her finest work in a decade, this is amazingly uniform for an album featuring eight different bassists and eight different drummers recorded in eight different studios in L.A., Nashville, and Vegas. To an extent that's a tribute to Leon Sylvers's consistent vocal and rhythm arrangements. To an extent it's a tribute to the authority this great pop singer still commands when she's in the mood. And to an extent it's attributable to flat material.
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Gladys Knight & the Pips: The Columbia Years,Gladys Knight & the Pips,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5156,"
Five essentially identical Vegas funk grooves on the A, five essentially anonymous pop-soul ballads on the B. You recall all ten as they come on, two or three as you reread the titles. What does it take to jolt this woman out of her own competence?

FALSE,B,Poor Little Critter on the Road,The Knitters,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3686,"
With Dave Alvin and John Doe getting a chance to pick and Exene getting a chance to sing purty, this ad hoc roots excursion is often tuneful and appealing, sometimes much more. I have my silly faves, but the convincer isn't silly at all--""Cryin' but My Tears Are Far Away,"" in which Doe not only writes and sings (and how) a classic country ballad, but creates a paradigm of urban alienation at the same time. Unfortunately, the bad stuff can be revoltingly cute, beatnik romanticism's softfolkie underbelly, as in the Old MacDonald intro to ""Rock Island Line"" or the speeded-up tag to ""Walkin' Cane,"" which seems designed to convince alienated urbans that you can get rock and roll out of this hick stuff.
"
FALSE,B,The Knowbody Else,The Knowbody Else,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10863,"
A classic white Southern rock band. Despite the terrible group name and the terrible label name (Stax subsidiary) and the terrible cover art, they really make it. Lead singer James Mangrum is a cross between Dr. John and Captain Beefheart, the arrangements are spare and evocative, the songs simple but never banal. Very nice.
"
FALSE,B,Anikana-o,Kongas,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7236,"
Here we have the best tracks by a 1974 version of the Kongas remixed and lengthened according to current disco usages. As any good Africanist would hope, the music depends more on congas and less on traps--the A side comprises some sixteen minutes of multipercussive dance music that moves steadily after a slow start. The B side is marred by a silly Eurorock voice going on about what ever happened to his world. Africanism, that's what.
"
FALSE,B,Konk Jams,Konk,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5943,"
As a white salsa band they were horn players who'd found their niche in the cosmos. Then they discovered sampling, most impressively on the Earth, Wind &amp; Flames rip ""Acid Jam."" So now they're a white funk band con salsa, and tastier for it, too.
"
FALSE,B,Everything's Kool and the Gang: Greatest Hits and More,Kool and the Gang,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1950,"
If the glitzy, vaguely hip-hop electro-disco ""club remixes"" of such bare-bones funk milestones as ""Jungle Boogie"" and ""Hollywood Swinging"" are a little disorienting, they're far from sacrilegious. Together with the hits (plus the well-earned ""Rags to Riches,"" companion piece to the well-earned ""Money and Power""), they put this undependable band in its place, a step ahead of the Commodores. Maybe two steps.
"
FALSE,B,Computer World,Kraftwerk,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1964,"
I once convinced myself to enjoy this band--if there had to be synthesizer rock, I thought, better it should be candidly dinky. And this is their funniest to date--every time I hear that machine intone ""I program my home computer/Bring myself into the future,"" I want to make a tape for all those zealots who claim a word processor will change my life. But fun plus dinky doesn't make funky no matter who's dancing to what program. Funk has blood in it.

FALSE,B,An Adjustment to Society,Kraut,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5164,"
New York's most likely hardcore boys keep the hooks coming for a whole side of enlightened rant--not twenty yet and they've figured out that past and future are real categories, always a tough lesson for rock-and-rollers. Overdisc, despite a terrific antiwar closer, they settle for blurred distinctions.
"
FALSE,B,Natural Act,Kris & Rita,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7244,"
Before the days of Oscar nominations and Jackie Wilson atrocities, when these married hippies were striving to gain acceptance as a mainstream country duo, they actually went out of their way to be boring--the material on Full Moon was so damn acceptable you almost didn't notice it was there. So I guess Breakaway was ""transitional,"" because this time the outlaw superstar duo work with much sharper songs, including three from T-Bone Burnett and two (good ones) from Billy Swan. Unfortunately, K&amp;R don't go out of their way to be interesting, and when you're as somnambulant as this pair, sharp songs aren't enough.
"
FALSE,B,Music of Bill Evans,Kronos Quartet,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10312,"
This ain't jazz, it's chamber music, and where the same not-quite-swinging strings worked up an agreeable tension on Monk Suite, here the compositional mesh is too neat--Evans damn near wrote chamber music to begin with. On the cute tunes there's an endearing novelty effect, but all the impressionistic watercolors gain is a gravity of tone that will challenge the assumptions of nobody interested enough to listen.

FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Fela Ransome-Kuti & the Africa 70,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4781,"
Read the fine print: ""Recorded in Lagos Nigaria [sic] and EMI, London 1971-1973."" In other words, in the early days of Afrobeat, while Fela was (a) in the throes of inspiration or (b) getting his shit together. Or, as you'd figure, some combination. Familiar riffs and beats are already in place on these four-minute songs, and harsh rhetoric, too. At times the singing goes for a feral power abandoned later. But the sonority and build and staying power of great Fela are missing, and missed.
"
FALSE,B,Pressure Cookin',Labelle,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7248,"
This certainly is a drastic improvement, although because Nona Hendryx still has trouble writing discernible melodies it demands more concentration than it's worth. What's changed is the arrangements--the backing musicians, especially keyboard honcho Andre Lewis (although each of the others puts a mark on at least one cut), achieve a jazz r&amp;b that gives the voices (all of them) room to groove. Patti LaBelle pulls out all the stops dynamically, but she also puts them back in--there's drama as well as declamation here--and on ""Hollywood"" and ""Let Me See You in the Light"" Hendryx gives her some lines. The covers don't hurt either--whoever had the idea of segueing from Thunderclap Newman to Gil Scott-Heron did justice to this noble group concept, and Stevie Wonder proved himself a true friend.
"
FALSE,B,Winner in You,Patti LaBelle,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5335,"
No previous crossover diva has purveyed such an out-and-out fabrication. Tina's weathered sexpot, Whitney's soulful yuppie--these are credible plays on credible personas. But though Patti is managed by her longtime husband and advised by her longtime son, she nevertheless keynotes her multiplatinum bid with a tribute to the loneliness of the soulful yuppie, written by yet another successfully married couple but inspired I'm sure by one-cut-stand Michael McDonald (cf. Tina meets Bryan, Aretha meets George, and I bet Whitney trades Jermaine in on Phil Collins or somebody next time). Then again, Patti doesn't start out with such surefire goods--her abrasive nasality has always kept her reputation cult. Which is why it's just as well for Patti that Richard Perry overwhelms the eight other producers: beats and tunes kick in till you could care less what organ she's singing through.
"
FALSE,B,Fantastic Voyage,Lakeside,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5340,"
Surprise--the fast ones are fun, the slow ones aren't. Fast ones might be even more fun if this weren't a band that praises Toto (the dog, but I think they're funning) in the same stanza with James Brown. Slow ones might be some fun if the singers had the style (skill's not the problem) to convey why they bother.
"
FALSE,B,Shadowland,K.D. Lang,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1901,"
Whether claiming Nashville for torch song, joining Tracy Chapman's New Dignity movement, or embalming country the way title-tunesmith Chris Isaak embalms rockabilly, Lang resembles Patsy Cline (or whomever) less than the Pet Shop Boys--impossible to suss out her relationship to music she presumably loves.
"
FALSE,B,On the Loose,Denise LaSalle,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10812,"
This leads with the proud, ebullient, raunchy ""A Man Size Job,"" which outromps even ""Run and Tell That"" on her debut, but after that things get quite nondescript--enjoyable except for the silly cover of ""Harper Valley P.T.A.,"" but nothing for Aretha to get nervous about. And Aretha could use a good case of nerves.
"
FALSE,B,Here I Am Again,Denise LaSalle,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10813,"
Not many country albums are crafted so carefully--LaSalle does one a year instead of two or three--but the similarities between Memphis and Nashville are striking here. I prefer her musical formula (despite strings from the accursed David Van De Pitte) to Billy Sherrill's, but she's not singer enough to make much of it. Her songs run the gamut from loss to infidelity to less complex sexual situations while Nashville's run the gamut from loss to infidelity to less complex emotional involvements. So what's the difference? It's that when LaSalle invites her lover to let his ""imagination run wild,"" I believe he might think of something I wouldn't.
"
FALSE,B,Under the Influence,Denise LaSalle,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10814,"
In the wake of two bad tries for the big label, this perpetually promising, perpetually frustrating singer-songwriter rebounds a little, flattering Millie Jackson sincerely every step of the way. The bleh ballad is more than overbalanced by ""Feet Don't Fail Me,"" a sorrowful, tellingly specific cheating song. But the self-production never finds a groove. Recommended to stubborn old souls.
"
FALSE,B,Guaranteed,Denise LaSalle and Satisfaction,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5345,"
Leading off with the irritating ""I'm Tripping on You"" (he's also ""a contact high""), side one is more of the utterly ordinary dance music this self-starting singer and songwriter has been wasting herself on for years. But side two puts three of her sexual autonomy specials around the best hook on the record, which is connected to something called ""E.R.A. (Equal Rights Amendment)."" The subtitle's to let you know she's not singing about earned run averages or the Economic Recovery Administration--she's singing about the Amendment, the piece of paper itself, and she knows it spells more than sexual autonomy. Ideal for dance-party fund-raisers.
"
FALSE,B,Baselines,Bill Laswell,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=307,"
One thing's sure--this is shitty background music. That's intentional, of course, but if Laswell's/Material's avant-fusion experiments are to prove useful to avant-pop listeners, they'd better reward attention more brilliantly than they do. Pulse or no pulse (and it can be either), the usual interesting-to-inventive, and even though I prefer Laswell's urban, conflict-ridden taste in noise to the ecological romanticism of the ethnojazz school, I don't hear the street or the subway (or my stereo) any better than before I put this on.
"
FALSE,B,Peter Laughner,Peter Laughner,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5351,"
These club dubs and worktapes aren't for audiophiles, but should convince mere rock-and-rollers that the Cleveland rock critic, a founding and former member of Pere Ubu before he excessed himself to death in 1977, deserves his musical legend. The songwriting is Dylanesque (""Baudelaire"") or better (""Sylvia Plath""), the early-Dylan impression uncanny (""Rag Mama""). His guitar moves aren't so undeniable--when I'm feeling world-historic they sound prophetic, but soon the mood passes and they revert to the untutored one-offs and amateur sketches they were.
"
FALSE,B,Well Down Blue Highway,The Leaving Trains,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5355,"
Side one does honor to the straight (nonhippie/nonhardcore/nonbiz) bohemianism of X, the Gun Club, and Chris D. Cruder and sloppier than X, as you'd guess if not hope, and a lot less pretentious than the other two, with songs that stay with you long enough to make you ponder Falling James's unhistrionic take on impending doom. That's side one. Side two is neopsychedelic drone.

Originals and influentials they obviously are, but too often individual pieces of their unprecedented music aren't necessary. They didn't have time to get really silly here, so this is unusually consistent, but ""Hots on for Nowhere"" is as close as it comes to a commanding cut, and I prefer ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""Rock and Roll"" and ""Dancing Days."" Nu?

FALSE,B,Women's Love Rights,Laura Lee,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7262,"
The title hit actually mentions ""women's liberators and men sympathizers,"" a black-music first, and unlike ""Respect,"" say, it lays out a critical analysis as well as asserting a prerogative. But the underlying if-you-can't-beat-'em passivity of this analysis comes clear in an amazing eight-minute version of ""Since I Fell for You"" (""You made me leave my happy home"" and so forth) that says a lot more about Lee's real power than ""Wedlock Is a Padlock."" It's also worth noting that many of her most militant songs were written by one William Weatherspoon. How about a chorus of ""You Don't Own Me,"" Ms. Lee?
"
FALSE,B,Live in New York City,John Lennon,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5363,"
Just by putting his all into such unsung great songs as ""Well, Well, Well"" and ""It's So Hard,"" the great singer comes a lot closer to justifying this ad hoc document than Jagger did with Ya-Ya's or Daltrey did with Leeds. The alternate ""Instant Karma"" and ""Cold Turkey"" and ""Mother"" are also welcome. But his accidental romance with Elephant's Memory never did him any good musically. And for all his encouragement Yoko wasn't yet a rock-and-roller, so ""Hound Dog"" remains a concept.

He abjures the slick. He honors the hook. He reckons the wages of imperialism. He spells forebears and forbearance correctly in the same sentence. So of course he's an Indie Hope. But his literate lyrics rarely hang together or hit home, and unless you miss Kevin Rowland more than Eileen ever did, his penchant for signifying commitment by vaulting up the scale is an annoying convention at best, an unlistenable tic at worst--namely, yoked to his limited melodic capacity on ""Dead Voices,"" which has Indie Lifer stamped on its copyright notice.

FALSE,B,Iceberg,Deke Leonard,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7271,"
Released a year ago in England by this once and future Man, Leonard's solo debut is as raw as the folk-rock fairytales of ex-Man Malcolm Morley are tame, which is no doubt why UA put out Help Yourself and not Leonard here. Welsh metal, Dave Edmunds influence, with slide and echo and a nice colloquial terseness applied to such traditional Llanellian themes as agro and looking for a woman--but not quite songful enough, or cool enough, to get the hots for.

FALSE,B,"Live at the International, Las Vegas",Jerry Lee Lewis,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7274,"
Unlike The Greatest Live Show on Earth, a rock and roll set, this concentrates on ""the country and western field of music."" Jerry Lee runs through a few hits, calls upon Linda Gail for a couple of numbers, barely notices Tom T. Hall's ""Ballad of Forty Dollars,"" and climaxes with ""Flip, Flop and Fly,"" originated by Joe Turner in the rhythm and blues field of music. Very fast, very arrogant, and I suppose very dispensable. But Jerry Lee throws Jerry Lee away a lot easier than I do.
"
FALSE,B,"The ""Killer"" Rocks On",Jerry Lee Lewis,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7275,"
Is Jerry Lee essaying a rock and roll revival because the country market is drying up for him or because he's never abandoned his dreams of world conquest? Only on ""Don't Be Cruel"" and ""Chantilly Lace"" does he sound triumphant, so it must be the former, which would be the only reason for him to cut this in Nashville anyway. Consequences of cutting in Nashville include a dippy chorus and the most egocentric version of ""Walk a Mile in My Shoes"" since the world began.

Though like most country best-ofs this isolates some strong songs, it also courts the middle-aged crazy market by picking titles old farts will recognize, like his lame-ass ""Who Will Buy the Wine"" and ""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues."" We don't get his loose-as-a-goose ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie Goodbye."" We also don't get his rockin' ""Rita Mae,"" his rockin' ""Don't Let Go,"" his rockin' ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" and I could go on.

Simon Cowell's British Idol possesses an exceptionally delicate version of the sock-it-to-'em karaoke-champ voice Cowell has made the gold standard of '00s pop. The subtle flutter of her finest melismatics could give an open-minded person goose bumps. Her coarser melismatics, however, are the usual showoff BS and probably also a commercial prerequisite, like not having a harelip. And because she doesn't write, this is karaoke where nobody knows the originals. Of course, when OneRepublic provided your lead single and ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is your literary highlight, it's just as well you don't write. ""Forgive Me"" would be a tolerable follow-up. Somehow I doubt Cowell cares.

FALSE,B,Little Feat,Little Feat,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7284,"
Lots of ""tight"" groups are influenced by the Band these days, but these guys could almost pass for them. The sensibility is freakier (""Strawberry Flats"" is a weary state-of-the-counterculture song, like Mother Earth's ""Then I'll Be Moving On""), and there are shades of the country Stones (""Truck Stop Girl"" is a more empathetic ""Dead Flowers"") as well as a convincing Howlin' Wolf imitation. But the dark instrumental interweave and pained vocals are right off Music From Big Pink. And I've always admired that album from a distance.

FALSE,B,Feats Don't Fail Me Now,Little Feat,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2079,"
So immersed are they in boogie tradition that they wrote a bunch of touring songs while breaking up. Good ones, of course, but I expect more of the thinking man's bar band than rock and roll doctors, American cities, and the lure of the road. Extra added distraction: a remake of ""Tripe Face Boogie"" designed for Sam Clayton's pulsating congas and Bill Payne's distended organ.
"
FALSE,B,Time Loves a Hero,Little Feat,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7285,"
Okay, so they're not a rock band or even a boogie band anymore--they're a funk band, praising the gods of rhythm for their black bassist and conga player. But neither Ken Gradney nor Sam Clayton could make the grade in P-Funk or the Crusaders or the Meters, and that's not even mentioning Bill Payne's synthesizers, which recall bad Rufus. And they still go through the motions of writing songs, the wordy kind that get in the way of the beat. In the end, though, that's what saves this--""Old Folks Boogie"" beats anything on the last two albums, ""Time Loves a Hero"" tries, and ""Rocket in My Pocket"" is a Lowell George readymade like you didn't think he had in him anymore.

FALSE,B,Vivid,Living Colour,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5387,"
A few songs--the just-minding-my-own-business-sucker ""Funny Vibe,"" the Mick Jagger production/tribute ""Glamour Boys,"" and ""Middle Man"" if it's as unironic as I hope--are smart enough, butwhile it's momentarily exhilarating to hear this all-black band come power-chording out of the box, after a while the fancy arrangements and strained soul remind me of, I don't know, Megadeth. Like any New Hendrix, Vernon Reid is only as good as his last context, and I'm not positive crossover metal is a good idea even in theory.

FALSE,B,14 Shots to the Dome,L.L. Cool J,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2092,"
Proof we didn't need that his talent is as phat as an elefant's phart and his brain is the size of a pea. Only it isn't his brain--it's his ability to comprehend contradiction. Like Michael Ivey, of all people, he flunked his follow-up because he can't figure out how to put success and rap together. Where Ivey (or the Basehead ""character,"" ha ha) takes his dorky confusion out on women, L.L.'s sexism is love-man suave--his ""It's so relaxin'"" after a piece of pussy gets off in the back of his Jeep is a rare moment of grace. Instead he slings the gangsta metaphors and handgun memories in the vain hope that the guys hanging out by the check-cashing place will think he's hard. But from the look of the crotch he's grabbing in several photos, as of now he just ain't.

FALSE,B,Waves,Charles Lloyd,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11434,"
The usual vaguely cosmic jazz enlivened by some sensual percussion and the best Beach Boys chorale since Sunflower. It's called ""TM,"" and I insist it stands for Terry Morgan because I'm afraid it stands for The Maharishi. Unfortunately, Mike Love reprises with a recitation, completing the eternal circle with a resonant zzzzzzzzzz.

FALSE,B,Does 12,Robert Jr. Lockwood,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7293,"
Lovers of urban blues will cherish this record by Robert Johnson's self-designated heir. It even boasts some adventurously progressive saxophone and twelve-string stylings that do no violence to a notoriously intransigent genre. But Lockwood is an undistinguished vocal interpreter, and only one of his originals--the imperturbable ""Selfish Ways""--is worthy of interpretation itself.

FALSE,B,Is This What You Want?,Jackie Lomax,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10842,"
There's something faintly perfunctory about Lomax's intensity, a common failing of British shouters, but this album has some good songs and superb production by George Harrison, plus Richard Starkey on drums.

FALSE,B,Lone Justice,Lone Justice,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5391,"
Although Maria McKee sure does have a big voice for such a young thing, sometimes I get the feeling she's playing grown-up with it--""After the Flood,"" about staying put on the family farm come hell or high water, doesn't exactly reflect the personal experience of someone who met her guitarist in a parking lot in the San Fernando Valley. Not that I doubt her passionate sincerity. Just that I find it generates more credibility when she worries about her man working late or warns him not to insult her in front of her friends.

FALSE,B,10/5/1960,The Long Ryders,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5392,"
What Jason and the Scorchers are to punk these guys are to new wave, with a soul Gram Parsons fans will recognize. But though Sid Griffin has assimilated the right songwriting skills, there's something tentative if not theoretical about the way he puts them to use--like he feels a little unworthy. Which means he probably is a little unworthy.

FALSE,B,La Pistola y El Corazon,Los Lobos,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2116,"
This tastefully modernized tour of their Mexican roots is admirably uncommercial and more than pleasant, but without imputing ""reverence"" or some other backhand insult, I'll mention that I prefer Rounder's ������������������Conjunto! albums because they're faster.

FALSE,B,Live From the Drunken Boat,The Lounge Lizards,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5778,"
Divested not only of fifth columnist Arto Lindsay but of all the guitar's vulgar ""rock""-tinged associations, the Lizards get beau ideal Teo Macero to produce a studio album in live drag. They sound like an arty jazz combo who've landed a month at a pretentious cocktail lounge in Minneapolis, or Brussels. Sometimes they gear their originals to what they deem the declasse ambience of the place, other times they say fuck it and lay down the simplified Cecil Taylor dearest to their hearts. They're better when they lower themselves. And they don't make it past Saturday night.
"
FALSE,B,Extended Niceties,Love of Life Orchestra,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5780,"
Concertmeister Peter Gordon doesn't deploy Arto Lindsay's untuned guitar as wickedly as lizard-leader John Lurie does, but how can you not love the way he punctuates and punctures the girlies crooning ""Don't, don't please don't leave me"" to close things off? It's enough to make you believe Gordon's otherwise unsung rock parody is funny.

FALSE,B,Lyle Lovett and His Large Band,Lyle Lovett,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2184,"
After kicking off with a sharp r&amp;b instrumental, the lapsed grad student dispenses with pretension and boils country down to the basics. Singing: well-schooled. Songcraft: canny, humorous. Concept: women, you can't live with 'em and you can't live without 'em--and it's their fault. Lest anyone mistake his intentions, he also covers ""Stand by Your Man."" Very humorous.

FALSE,B,No-Man's Land,Lene Lovich,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5783,"
Lovich hasn't so much gone Anglodisco as vice versa: she was swooping through postpunk well before the coming of the synthesizers, and she's no less goofy today. Nevertheless, she does sound less goofy, because she's surrounded by swoopers. Which doesn't make her secret privatism any easier to get to.
"
FALSE,B,I Wanna Be Free,Loretta Lynn,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7303,"
Like any country workhorse, Lynn customarily pads her three or four albums a year with the popular songs of the day. Here the unadorned sexuality of ""Help Me Make It Through the Night"" and the white gospel roots of ""Put Your Hand in the Hand"" prove that for a great natural singer remakes needn't be a waste. But then there's ""Rose Garden."" And ""Me and Bobby McGee.""
"
FALSE,B,When the Tingle Becomes a Chill,Loretta Lynn,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7306,"
Lola Jean Dillon's title hit is the best song about frigidity, as we once called it, since the Velvet Underground's ""Here She Comes Now,"" and gets Lynn's most listenable side in years off with a bang. Too bad ""Daydreams About Night Things,"" the best song about having the hots for your spouse since ""Behind Closed Doors,"" wasn't chosen to soften the impact of ""You Love You"" and ""All I Want From You (Is Away)""--""Leaning on Your Love,"" which got the nod instead, belongs on side two, which you needn't bother with, since nobody else did.

FALSE,B,Skynyrd's First and . . . Last,Lynyrd Skynyrd,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7311,"
I'm glad to own this album, cut at Muscle Shoals in the pre-MCA days and overdubbed for possible release before the plane crash ended their career. I'm impressed by both the packaging (forty-four photos, many terrific) and John Swenson's notes (extensive, acute), and I like the music fine. But I don't think this is where I'll go to hear Skynyrd. Even if I wanted to disregard the two song-poems by long-departed drummer-vocalist Ricky Medlocke and the less than essential alternate version of ""Things Goin' On,"" I expect more from Skynyrd than good white funk and second-rate message songs. And ""Was I Right or Wrong"" ain't it.
"
FALSE,B,On Fyre,The Lyres,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3698,"
Just like their fellow neotraditionalists in rockabilly and r&amp;b, these pillars of garage principle set themselves the nearly impossible task of substituting magic for the real thing every track out. As the best of such bands so often do, they get off on a rousing start, in this case by marshalling their two best originals, which they keep going with the help of a couple of covers through all of side one. On side two they slow down a little, and not only isn't the result magical, it's barely rhythmic.

FALSE,B,8,Madhouse,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5397,"
This isn't ""fusion jazz""--it's both more and less, which with ""fusion jazz"" are both good things. In the tradition of Rogers Nelson Dance Music Inc., it not only digs into rhythms jazzbos would dub mechanical, it also makes up new ones--while permitting the drums what sound like snatches of improvisation. Augmented by snatches of eavesdropped dialogue and one faked orgasm, the rhythms impose an ironic distance designed to discourage us from taking the assorted mood-to-avant clich�����������������"
FALSE,B,Like a Virgin,Madonna,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2202,"
If a woman wants to sell herself as a sex fantasy I'll take a free ride--as long as the fantasy of it remains out front, so I don't start confusing image with everyday life. But already she's so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical (just like Bowie, right?), she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy.
"
FALSE,B,True Blue,Madonna,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2203,"
Critics flock to her uneven product the way liberal arts magnas flock to investment banking--so desperate are they to connect to a zeitgeist that has nothing to do with them that they decide a little glamour and the right numbers add up to meaningful work, or at least ""fun."" I'm not saying her flair is pleasureless--the generosity she demands in the inexhaustible ""Open Your Heart"" is a two-way street and then some. But she doesn't speak for the ordinary teenaged stiff any more than Reagan speaks for union members (that's called ""selling to,"" folks). And while the antiabortion content of ""Papa Don't Preach"" isn't unequivocal, and wouldn't make the song bad by definition if it were, the ambiguity is a cop-out rather than an open door (or heart), which is bad. In a time of collective self-deception, we don't need another snow job.
"
FALSE,B,The Real Thing,Taj Mahal,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7317,"
Taj's second straight two-album set is a live one, featuring sidemen from John Simon and John Hall to Kwasi DziDournu, four count-'em four tubas, and ten count-'em ten titles. Lots of fun, but as you might expect, things get very loose, especially when the tubists lay their burdens down.

FALSE,B,Recycling the Blues and Other Related Stuff,Taj Mahal,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7320,"
Heard in the wake of one of Taj's magic shows, the live side seemed an amusing simulation, but no more--the call-and-response goes on too long at 3:40. This might also be said of the 8:40 Spanish guitar (banjo?) solo on side two. The record earns its title, though--the Smithsonian ought to hire this man. Latest instrument: the Pointer Sisters.
"
FALSE,B,Music fuh Ya (Musica para Tu),Taj Mahal,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7323,"
This time the Caribbeanization adds steel drums and a pervasive calypso beat to the country-blues vocal phrasing and jazz-voiced horns, and finally an appropriate smoothness is achieved. The songs aren't much, but ""Sailin' Into Walker's Cay"" cancels out his bass player's tedious ""Curry,"" and if you have to listen easy you might as well relax with this.
"
FALSE,B,In a Different Climate,Mallard,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2230,"
In case you ever wonder what happened to Captain Beefheart's Magic Band, a few of them joined up here, playing an electric music that recalls country blues (not to mention the Captain himself) in both the guttural density of its sound and the downhome surrealism of its lyrics. Hard to tell it's them only because Beefheart, that lovable eccentric, retains legal rights to their lovable stage names, thus compelling musicians he once induced to remain anonymous to revert to their unknown monikers.

FALSE,B,Prince of Rai,Cheb Mami,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5404,"
'Tis said this tux-clad pretender has a sweeter voice than the goat-king Khaled, but is a green olive sweeter than a lamb chop? He's just higher, more adenoidal, more adolescent. Recorded recently enough to get the groove-bending bass and violin right, this is less monotonous than the competition. Standout cut features a synthesizer echoing the melody line in tribute to ""the style `L'Oranais,' a form that predates `Rai.'"" Nothing like a touch of tradition to add pop novelty to the world-beat norm.

FALSE,B,Be Good to Yourself at Least Once a Day,Man,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7334,"
Authenticated by one Jones (guitarist Micky) and one Williams (drummer Terry), this collective hails from Wales, where human life as we know it began eons ago. No great songs or great solos among these four tracks, but plenty of audible camaraderie--sounds like a cross between the Grateful Dead and the Quicksilver Messenger Service of eons ago, albeit steadier than either, which is too bad in the former case and a good thing in the latter. Upped a notch for historicity.
"
FALSE,B,Coming Out,The Manhattan Transfer,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7343,"
As the memory of the way they demean their material onstage fades, I find I can admire and even enjoy their second album. The scatter-shot eclecticism of the first LP has been aimed--especially on side one, which I much prefer--at the kind of novelty tunes, rock and non-rock, that everyone who listened to pre-Beatles radio loved. The anonymity of the oldies Tim Hauser here unearths--it took me weeks to remember that Roy Hamilton (he of ""Unchained Melody"") came back with ""Don't Let Go,"" I still can't place ""Zindy Lou,"" and even the Motown remake is from Kim Weston--makes a case for the theory that pop music is a delightful but essentially inexpressive industrial product. But the newer songs, several of which are inexpressive only in spite of themselves, destroy the illusion.
"
FALSE,B,Lady T,Teena Marie,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5407,"
This young white hope isn't breaking ""r&amp;b"" because she sounds so ""black""--she's not a whole heck of a lot funkier than the Doobie Brothers. She's breaking r&amp;b because that's what Motown knows how to do. The hit, ""Behind the Groove,"" is funky enough (the Doobies would give up golf for it), but then again, the more typical ""You're All the Boogie I Need"" is boogie enough. On the fast ones she sounds like Suzi Quatro blessed with a boyfriend smart enough to take it slow. On the slow ones she sounds dumb.
"
FALSE,B,Starchild,Teena Marie,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5410,"
Ballads aren't Teena's problem--self-expression is. Marvin and Aretha are so abundantly endowed they can afford to meander occasionally, but neither would dare stretch ""Out on a Limb"" to 6:38. Better Teena should make like Maya Angelou and design her slow ones for the page. On the other hand, Teena's fast ones need no apology, which she may finally have learned doesn't mean they need no hooks. And when she's riding a hit she can take Marvin and Aretha to the bank.
"
FALSE,B,Survival,Bob Marley & the Wailers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=391,"
It's great in theory that Marley is once again singing about oppression rather than escape, but in practice the album's most powerful political statement is the diagram of the slave ship on the cover and inner sleeve. There's a world of difference between songs of experience like ""No Woman, No Cry"" and songs of generalization like ""So Much Trouble."" And it's a difference that Marley and his musicians are too damn sophisticated to make the most of.
"
FALSE,B,Awake,Julian Marley,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15127,"
It's the curse of audibly inherited talent. Whatever your own limitations, which are often considerable, invidious comparisons shadow your every move as you negotiate between the arrogance of the privileged and the confidence of the born performer--and as your fans try not to wish you were someone else. This album has its moments--the well-worked title cut, a little homily called ""All I Know,"" the ""in a good way"" aside after ""everyone's going crazy"" (on the dancefloor, he wishes). But for the most part it's as heavy-handed as Julian's close-but-no-spliff variation on his fathers timbre and phrasing. Granted, tracks eight and nine do give one hope--until one realizes that the agents of hope are Mr. Cheeks and brother Damian, respectively.

FALSE,B,Bright Day,Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5416,"
He's a confident international entertainer where his dad was a driven third-world artist, which is a loss, but disgruntled accusations that he's betraying his heritage, his confreres, and the great reggae diaspora would disappear if he could take his songs where he wants them to go. Until that if-ever, the synthesis will be more impressive both macro (reggae-rock headed Afrofunk) and micro (this guitar break, that piano comp) than in the middle distance where life is lived and music heard.
"
FALSE,B,"Newport News, Virginia",Esther Marrow,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11064,"
The opening cut, ""He Don't Appreciate It,"" is such an exceptional example of hard soul (with fantastic arrangement and production by Bob Thiele) that I recommend the whole album to devotees of the genre. (It is also available as a single.) the rest is jazz-oriented, good but uneven: some of the ballads are very weak and there is too much dependence on long codas.
"
FALSE,B,A New Life,The Marshall Tucker Band,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7354,"
If I were from the South, I imagine I'd love this record, because it would be about me, which would be some kind of relief. Since I'm from New York, I have to complain about the almost complacent evenness of the band's aural landscape even as I take off from an occasional rill and dig into their heimische rural mysticism.
"
FALSE,B,Shots from a Cold Nightmare,Moon Martin,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7355,"
Hook fiends will love these ten catchy little numbers, but me, I'm put off by Martin's pop drawl--""tender"" or ""excited,"" he's dispassionate in a way that doesn't suit his musical or lyrical directness. Or maybe it's just that eight songs about treacherous girls are four or five too many.
"
FALSE,B,Let's Get Small,Steve Martin,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11310,"
Martin's style of tastelessness is refreshing--you know he'd do a blue routine or a moron joke if he could come up with one that was funny. But it's not true that he's unsullied by topicality; his definitively post-hip humor is as bound to time and place as Mort Sahl's, less ""pure"" than Bill Cosby's or Jerry Lewis's (not to mention Buster Keaton's). And having listened to this record shortly after making his acquaintance in concert, I find that most of it doesn't wear especially well. Pardon me.

FALSE,B,Alone Together,Dave Mason,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=944,"
I know, the real heavy in Traffic, great songwriter, poor Stevie is lost without him, Delaney &amp; Bonnie on tour, rakka-rakka-rakka. I love ""Feelin' Alright"" myself. But I've never wondered for a second what it means, and only when the music is as elemental as ""Feelin' Alright"" can such questions be overlooked. I mean, songs have words. This is both complex and likable-to-catchy, with a unique light feel that begins with the way Mason doubles on acoustic and electric. But he doesn't have the poetic gift that might justify his withdrawal from ""games of reason"" in the immodestly entitled ""Just a Song."" Songs have words.
"
FALSE,B,"Give, Get, Take and Have",Curtis Mayfield,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7376,"
This meanders more than is conscionable, though Curtis has been drifting through the ozone for so long that you don't notice at first. (For orientation purposes, compare Gladys Knight's ""Mr. Welfare Man."") But I am most pleased to report that the opener, ""In My Arms Again,"" is the first top-notch song he's written for himself since ""Super Fly,"" (somebody bad riffing on guitar--sounds like . . . Curtis Mayfield), and that the three that follow rock and roll.
"
FALSE,B,Love Is the Place,Curtis Mayfield,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5424,"
With help from Dino Fekaris, Mayfield's best album in years includes his first hit in years, but neither has created much stir, which is fair enough--the single is catchy and nothing more, the album honest and nothing more. Except, except. ""Just Ease My Mind,"" a Mayfield-composed ballad, is a gentle plea for succor so purely country I think I've happened upon some disciple of Stoney Edwards or Jesse Winchester every time it catches me unawares. It shouldn't be lost.
"
FALSE,B,McCartney,Paul McCartney,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7378,"
As self-indulgent as Two Virgins or Life With the Lions, yet marketed as pop, this struck me as a real cheat at first. But I find myself won over by its simulated offhandedness. Paul is so charming a melodist (and singer) that even though many of the songs are no more than snatches, fragments, ditties, they get across, like ""Her Majesty"" extended to two minutes. And though Paul's do-it-yourself instrumentals stumble now and then, the only one that winds up on its fundament is the percussion-based ""Kreen-Akrore."" Maybe Linda should take up the drums. She wouldn't be starting from any further back than hubby.
"
FALSE,B,Tug of War,Paul McCartney,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5428,"
Most rock-and-rollers look like simps or cynics by the time they hit thirty-five. Others retain the irrepressible exuberance of a Stevie Wonder, or grasp it again in magic moments the way Carl Perkins does on this album's most affecting cut. A few rare ones age gracefully into fresh-eyed wisdom, like Neil Young and John Lennon. But no matter how serious and sensible he gets, McCartney's perpetual boyishness conveys the perpetual callowness of a musical Troy Donahue. I don't think this is intentional--in his personal life he seems at least as adult as anyone I've named, and he's put his hard-earned craft to mature use on this LP. But it might almost be dumb love songs.
"
FALSE,B,Genuine Cowhide,Delbert McClinton,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7384,"
Texas partisans tout this whoopersnapper as God's own leather-lunged, bicentennial, rockabilly truth, but I can't hear it. He's not ravaged enough; his crazy enthusiasm sounds too professional, too glib; there are none of those spaced-out moments that lend such vulnerability, and credibility, to a Billy Swan. Does this mean I'm complaining that Delbert sings too good? Could be.
"
FALSE,B,Keeper of the Flame,Delbert McClinton,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7385,"
McClinton's cult sentimentalizes bar music--having established that a saloon is as fruitful a nexus for music as a studio, they go on to claim that it's better (""more authentic""). But despite his superior sense of rhythm, Delbert's basically a male Texas Linda Ronstadt--a strong-voiced, versatile performer who doesn't come across on record as an especially interesting person. This not only puts him at the mercy of songwriters and arrangements but limits his taste in both. Album number five, his second for Johnny Sandlin and Capricorn, is probably his best since number one--funkier but less directly dependent on r&amp;b, longer on originals than his last two for ABC, and opening with great readings from Chuck Berry and Randall Bramblett. In short, as enjoyable and forgettable as a Friday night out.
"
FALSE,B,Live at the 1983 Vermont Midsummer Festival,Dick McCormack,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5432,"
His most recent offering doesn't show off this Vermonter's durable songwriting (and collecting) like 1981's acerbically folkloric ""Who Ever Said It Would Be Easy?"" disc--something in a live crowd must bring out the easy wisdom in him. But he almost compensates with jokes, one of which is a drawn-out tale of Jack &amp; Allen &amp; Neil &amp; Clams that's irresistible the first three or four times through and another of which will give you an idea of his style of state chauvinism: ""How many Vermonters does it take to screw in a lightbulb? It takes five--one to screw it in and four to complain how much better the old one was.""
"
FALSE,B,High on the Blues,Jimmy McCracklin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7386,"
Some think McCracklin's faintly plosive moan is distinctive. I think it's a type--ideal for outposts of deep soul, but only serviceable (or a little more) as pure instrument. And you know what? The deep soul drumming of coproducer Al Jackson almost puts it across.
"
FALSE,B,Rock Your Baby,George McCrae,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7387,"
The folks in Miami liked the single so much they extended it through an entire album--literally for eight minutes, then figuratively over long stretches of closely related rhythm track, with McCrae's serviceable but emotionally limited falsetto on top. Funny thing is, the single is so durable they almost got away with it.
"
FALSE,B,Rockin' Chair,Gwen McCrae,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7388,"
I was relieved to be left tepid by this LP's original release, since it was getting embarrassing to wax warm over Miami every time out. But the newly added title hit, almost as irresistibly Memphis-cum-disco-with-a-hook as hubby's ""Rock Your Baby,"" transforms it into more warm wax, tuff enuff to make you wonder what ever happened to soul music.

FALSE,B,Just Can't Sit Down Music,Mel McDaniel,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8241,"
With his best material--not commercially, but critically, a concept that doesn't cut much vinyl down in Nashville--slotted three and four on each side, McDaniel remains a notably decent artist caught between his druthers and his a&amp;r man. So be glad the album's gem, ""Stand on It"" (composer credit: ""B. Springsteen""), did eventually make some noise as a single--albeit not enough to qualify for the best-of that followed it into the racks.
"
FALSE,B,Mel McDaniel With Oklahoma Wind,Mel McDaniel With Oklahoma Wind,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5433,"
A rugged old pro who's hewed a path between outlaw grease and countrypolitan silicone, McDaniel here enters a Nashville studio with his road band, a mild act of defiance that produces an album sensible folks can listen to clean through without Bromo-Seltzer--though the overly tough-minded may want to keep a Tum or two at hand.
"
FALSE,B,Have I Got a Deal for You,Reba McEntire,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5434,"
Finally her own award-winning, best-selling woman, she assumes coproducer status and sheds Harold Shedd, whom some would say got her this far. And indeed, with a little help from Jimmy Bowen she refines the formula-no backup choruses, no newfangled keyboards, no bedroom lyrics. She's a lot more her own woman than hot-to-trot centerfold candidates like Janie Fricke. But though occasionally her music defeats country's sex-role divisions--the self-composed I-never-actually-cheated song ""Only in My Mind"" is so proud and virtuous and deeply regretful it could give a fella bad dreams--she suggests that female country singers are going to have trouble rebelling neotraditionally. Especially with men providing the material.
"
FALSE,B,Whoever's in New England,Reba McEntire,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5435,"
Winning though her directness may be, McEntire is neither as clear as George Strait nor as lavish as John Anderson. In fact, the basics she gets back to recall Rosanne Cash more than anyone else, and no matter how she tries, she just can't rock out (or sing) like Nashville's crossover queen. Most convincing are the jauntily defiant cheating-on song ""Little Rock,"" where she plays a rich man's wife, and the dolefully forgiving cheated-on song ""Whoever's in New England,"" where she plays a young executive's wife. Elsewhere she's mostly just direct.
"
FALSE,B,The Spy,Bat McGrath,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7395,"
Although he's a nice singer, McGrath is bound in by the mildly jazzy conventions of contemporary folk music. But his songs still say more about how it is for all those formerly young guys with beards who chose to live in the country back around 1970 than all the paeans to homemade bread coming out of Vermont, Colorado, and Marin.
"
FALSE,B,Roger McGuinn,Roger McGuinn,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7397,"
From L.A. session men to Charles Lloyd eight-miles-high to Bruce Johnston ooh-ooh to Clark, Clarke, Crosby, Hillman &amp; McGuinn, Roger's solo debut sounds more coherent than any Byrds album since Sweetheart of the Rodeo, which must prove he's an auteur. Jacques Levy plays the Gram Parsons catalyst, but since Levy only writes lyrics the chemistry is a good deal less powerful. And it does worry me that Levy worked on all the good cuts: the ones about highjacking, love in Vietnam and ""my new woman,"" and especially ""I""m So Restless,"" the best state-of-the-music song since ""All the Young Dudes.""
"
FALSE,B,Thunderbyrd,Roger McGuinn,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7401,"
I hate the name-dropping title, but this is McGuinn's best since his solo debut, including a tongue-in-cheek version of Dylan's mystical-romantic ""Golden Loom,"" a psychedelic reminiscence, and good-to-great covers from George Jones, Tom Petty, and--the conceptual triumph--Peter Frampton.
"
FALSE,B,McGuinness Flint,McGuinness Flint,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7403,"
Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle's consistently tuneful tributes to America and other romances derive most of their character from the jolly-English quirkishness of the band's folk-rock. Only ""International,"" one of their two attempts at a weightier lyric, is anywhere near as irresistible as ""When I'm Dead and Gone,"" and ""Brother Psyche"" indicates why they usually play it safe.
"
FALSE,B,Honky Tonk Angel,Ellen McIlwaine,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7404,"
McIlwaine falls into all the overambitious traps--she dramatizes, she vaunts her range, she improvises when she should just sing--and yet she gets away with it, because enough of her grand attempts work. It's good to hear a woman play bottleneck guitar (in an appropriate context, too) and the two times she goes up an octave on ""God"" in ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"" almost justify a whole side.

In which the fifth Face, his mates dispersed to the Stones, the Who, Meher Baba, and Hollywood, makes a Faces album as good 'n' raucous as, oh, Long Player. He's more convincing taking a pot shot at the Hollywood Face than movin' out (on guess what kind of person) or seducing a virgin (that's the Hollywood Face's specialty). But if men will be boys, this is how they should go about it.

FALSE,B,Waltz Darling,Malcolm McLaren and the Bootzilla Orchestra,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5801,"
""Buffalo Girls"" notwithstanding, this is the first time since Bow Wow Wow that the old reprobate has shown pop ambition--Bootsy and Jeff Beck charge serious money to help you with your culture lessons, and money McLaren normally keeps to himself. Linking house, funk, and rai to the historic sexual breakthrough of the Strauss waltz, McLaren romanticizes the rich just like he's always romanticized the poor. But the concept is a cover for the only message he's ever cared about--teen sexuality as liberation, especially for old reprobates. ""Algernon's Simply Awfully Good at Algebra"" is as good as its title, maybe better. The rest is soft-core kiddie porn.

FALSE,B,My Goal's Beyond,Mahavishnu John McLaughlin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7406,"
What a mind-fuck! Just when I have him pegged as the Duane Eddy of the Aquarian Age he goes acoustic on me! ""Peace One,"" ""Peace Two,"" yeah yeah yeah--it's easy when you don't plug in. Conjuring peace out of chaos the way Devotion does is the real trick. And while like most white people I've failed to develop my taste in sitar music. I don't like the looks of this Mahalakshmi on the cover--she's white too, and I'll bet she got on the record the same way Sri Chinmoy got to write the notes. Sitar sound effects from George Harrison are one thing--that's just rock and roll. John's goal is supposed to be beyond.
"
FALSE,B,Lyte as a Rock,MC Lyte,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5440,"
Unlike so many of her femme-metal counterparts, she knows how to talk tough without yielding to the stupid temptations of macho. But as nobody's girl, she spreads 10 tracks among four producer-DJs, who chill too close to the max as she attempts to carry the music with her bare rap. Even their weirdest hooks are understated by half, and Lyte's quotes (not samples) from ""I'm in the Mood for Love,"" ""Big Girls Don't Cry,"" ""I Am Woman,"" and ""Hit the Road Jack"" aren't loud enough to compensate. Minimal isn't the only way she can go, as Sinead O'Connor fans know. Are they in for an unpleasant surprise.
"
FALSE,B,Meat Puppets,Meat Puppets,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5444,"
These Phoenix boys not only realize L.A. punk's no-wave proclivities in brief, doomy noise songs that sound like DNA meeting the Marx Brothers, they cover ""Tumblin' Tumbleweeds."" And include a dancy lyric sheet featuring lines like ""You are like children in the marketplace/Shouting to your playmates"" and ""We get stones like it's going out of style."" None of which they go so far as to pronounce over or under the hardcore roar.
"
FALSE,B,Message from the Meditations,The Meditations,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7411,"
A new group has to score singles often in Jamaica before getting an album, and with three singers--including two distinctive high tenors--sharing writing and lead vocals, this is a nice one. Just wish it featured more island chauvinism--if I'm not mistaken, ""Running From Jamaica"" gets on those who emigrate to Canada, Britain, the States, and Africa--and less of the male kind.
"
FALSE,B,The Glitterhouse,Medium Medium,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5447,"
""Hungry So Angry"" is so much their greatest moment--the drop-dead riff that's their entree to the Funk Club--I'm tempted to recommend the EP, which offers two versions of the thing. But in the context ""Hungry So Angry"" sets up, the more abstract music they prefer comes across not only raw and spatial but also danceable, and you hardly notice their arty vocal dementia. Which isn't to say you shouldn't go for the EP.
"
FALSE,B,The Mekons,The Mekons,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5449,"
Must be a confusing time in the old country, what with Eurodisco coming back postpunk and the no-wave imperative advancing on no future. Where the Gang of Four respond by constructing a herky-jerk funk from their own inexpertise, their Leeds comrades--who were on that one last year already--yoke an amateur anarchism less obstreperous than Wire's or the Fall's to vaguely traditional songs almost domestic in their attention to modest detail. They also rewrite ""Lipstick on Your Collar"" I think it is. You figure it out.
"
FALSE,B,Uh-Huh,John Cougar Mellencamp,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5454,"
The changed billing indicates John's eagerness to talk straight after years of filtering himself through an inconclusive image, and I wish every AOR hero put his triple platinum to such honest use. Only thing is, the depth of John's populist intentions far outstrips the depth of his populist perceptions--he was just as interesting telling little white lies.
"
FALSE,B,I Miss You,Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7417,"
For most of the eight-and-a-half minutes of the title cut, one Blue Note attempts a calm rapprochement with his estranged wife over the telephone while the others shout, moan, and sob his unspoken feelings--summed up by the title, which must repeat a hundred times. But not even their top-forty breakthrough, ""If You Don't Know Me by Now,"" matches up. Gamble, Huff &amp; Co. show off their skill at instrumental deployment and Melvin provides gorgeous vocal arrangements, but too often it all adds up to noble banalities sententiously expressed. And sometimes the banalities aren't so noble.
"
FALSE,B,Cargo,Men at Work,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5457,"
A touch dour, two touches bemused, and probably way too passive, they're so smashingly unambitious that they're forgettable when they don't strike just the right note. But I've always considered democracy more radical than misanthropy. And I appreciate their sniping at the military-industrial establishment.
"
FALSE,B,Cabbage Alley,The Meters,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7425,"
Just what do these people want? They're still making up titles like ""Gettin' Funkier All the Time,"" even singing one called ""Do the Dirt."" But they're also stretching out a catchy little number called ""Stay Away"" with what annotator Barry Hansen refers to gingerly as ""some most unusual electronic adventures"" and putting voice to Neil Young's ""Birds"" and their own ""Lonesome and Unwanted People."" And what can it mean that the catchiest little number of all has no words and two titles--""You've Got to Change (You've Got to Reform)""?
"
FALSE,B,Fire on the Bayou,The Meters,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3721,"
Thanks to new conga player Cyril Neville, the singing has gotten better, but no matter how much I love ""They All Ask'd for You,"" I'm not sure that's good. Distracts us from the drummer. And maybe it distracts the drummer, too.
"
FALSE,B,You Ain't Rollin Your Roll Rite,Augie Meyers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7430,"
Doug Sahm's faithful organist has a rather shallow voice, but he knows good material and occasionally writes some--""Sugar Blu"" is the way Doug ought to be opening his sets these days, and the title song sounds like advice to rock and rollers who get lost on their way to legendhood. Straightforward Tex-Mex like they don't hardly make no more.
"
FALSE,B,My Main Squeeze,Augie Meyers,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5462,"
History having advanced backwards, the eternal Tex-Mex sideman picks up an accordion. Ronda's on his Honda, and if Velma from Selma's dad doesn't turn him into enchiladas, all will be well.
"
FALSE,B,Primitive Love,Miami Sound Machine,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5463,"
CBS's preemptive strike at MCA's TV-soundtrack capability casts Gloria Estefan, in real life the daughter of a Batista bodyguard, and her hub Emilio, ""Percussion, Manager,"" as minstrels to Viceland's cocaine trade in crossover mode. Real criminals like their music tougher (also live-er), but before you tsk-tsk the perfidy of cops you should heed your body and note that these prefab grooves move--not least the one called ""Mucho Money.""
"
FALSE,B,Ice on Fire,Mighty Diamonds,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7437,"
Just as an assassination attempt doesn't commit Bob Marley to propaganda, so the best reggae album of 1976 doesn't commit the Mighty Diamonds to the music of Jamaica. Here they bid to become just another black harmony group, yoking Allen Toussaint's production to the Kingston beat and covering ""Tracks of My Tears"" (well). We could use another black harmony group, but unfortunately. Toussaint isn't noted for his work with groups, and like most harmony-group albums (not to mention reggae albums) this sounds samey even as it switches unpredictably from Toussaint songs to Mighty Diamonds originals.
"
FALSE,B,Deeper Roots (Back to the Channel),Mighty Diamonds,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7438,"
Most of these songs confidently cross jingle and chant, and Donald Shaw sings in his chains like a true son of Smokey. But never once do the riddims become anthemic. For advanced reggae students only.
"
FALSE,B,The Roots Is There,Mighty Diamonds,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5468,"
The amazing thing about reggae of a certain quality--in which an affecting singer like Donald Shaw joins ace session players--is that no matter how sedulously it restates platitudes about roots and girls and Jah, its small graces eventually get its equally sedulous melodies across. But why should anyone who doesn't credit the platitudes give them that long?
"
FALSE,B,The Rock,Frankie Miller,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1287,"
If like me you have a taste for English soul singers who have taste in American soul exemplars, you will be pleased to learn that Henry McCulloch does a hell of a Steve Cropper imitation. But Miller is no Joe Cocker (not to mention Toots Hibbert) (not to mention . . . ) and he was better off writing fewer songs.
"
FALSE,B,Number 5,Steve Miller,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7441,"
The songs about going to the country, going to Mexico, and eating chili are more substantial than those about Vietnam, Jackson-Kent, and the military-industrial complex. Fortunately, all three of the latter are supposed to bring the album to a rousing (zzzzz) climax, which leaves side one free to bring you back humming.
"
FALSE,B,Your Saving Grace,The Steve Miller Band,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11066,"
The usual sweet-hard rock, pleasant and soulful enough.
"
FALSE,B,Circle of Love,The Steve Miller Band,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5471,"
You whippersnappers want catchy pop tunes, this high-tech cornball's got 'em with blues changes--four nifties on side one. You want hypnotic electro-groove, he's got that with blues changes too--eighteen minutes of it, complete with muddled attack on the military-industrial establishment. Both sides offer sound effects at no additional charge, and Steve would like everyone to know that he's been doing this shit since 1968.
"
FALSE,B,Abracadabra,The Steve Miller Band,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5472,"
With longtime bandbuddy Gary Mallaber making like Jeff Barry, Miller fulfills his hippie destiny and turns into the Archies, or really the Monkees, since he did write the title hit himself, and it will probably stand as the biggest pop tune of 1982, by which I definitely don't mean the most quintessential, because this one is blissfully catchy and blissfully simple and blissfully schlocky and blissfully tricky, like the rest of the album only more so.
"
FALSE,B,Mink DeVille,Mink DeVille,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7447,"
Those who believe ""underground"" rock means a return to basics and nothing more will cheer this sleek, friendly white r&amp;b record, because they'll understand it. Those who insist on learning something new about the basics will continue to prefer the Ramones and Blondie, or Springsteen and J. Geils.
"
FALSE,B,Black Roots,Sugar Minott,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7449,"
This is Jamaica pop, by which I mean modestly tuneful Rasta talk mellifluously sung. Pleasant, but nothing to base a canon on--only ""Oppressors Oppression"" (makes a wise man mad) and ""Two Time Loser"" (in love careless love) will do more than make you hum along.
"
FALSE,B,Inna Reggae Dance Hall,Sugar Minott,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5478,"
A mild-mannered pro who ""Nah Follow Nuh Fashion"" because he never lets it get ahead of him trades in the Roots Radics on a computer-compatible rhythm machine, upping the tempo slightly and shifting his croon toward chant. Product, sure, but useful product, which even in Jamaica is an achievement these days.
"
FALSE,B,The Punch Line,Minutemen,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5480,"
They're politniks who love punk, with a name that mocks hardcore's rightwing rep and their own aesthetic--these eighteen ""songs"" average under fifty seconds apiece. The lyrics don't rhyme or even scan, less poems than the jottings of young men given to cultural bullshit. ""History Lesson""--""hundred thousand years ago homosapiens stood erect mind empty fresh created love and hate created god and antigod human slaughtered human for power""--gets the flavor: not Fredric Jameson, but better-informed than the skinheads they play for. And where last year's seven-inch Paranoid Time could pass for speed-rock, the funky dissonance here has no parallel in the genre or anywhere else: not Ornette Coleman, but better-informed than the Circle Jerks they play with.

FALSE,B,City of Angels,The Miracles,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3728,"
Tom Smucker, explaining why this was included in his annual top ten: ""Motown moves to L.A. and likes what it finds. It's very important that in an era when people don't like cities some people can still find them romantic. And that L.A. is the city. And that Motown are the people."" This is sweet and true, but it ignores the point, which is that this record is a riot. In fact, its achievement is so complete, so true to itself, that the lurking possibility of a put-on can't be dismissed. Space makes it impossible to reprint Inspirational Verse (Q: If the first line is ""Homosexuality"" and the rhyming word is ""society,"" what's the third line? A: ""Well I guess they need more variety""), but print doesn't do it justice anyway. You have to hear the intonations, the falsettos, the backups, the orchestration, some of which can be credited to producer Freddie Perren. All this plus: the first soul song about an underground newspaper.

One of the two most impressive tracks on this live all-new-material farewell from the seminal Boston indie band is a Stooges cover. The other is an Ubu cover. The rest--eight songs--is entirely original. I'm sure this isn't the horrible truth their label has in mind, but rock historians should jot it down somewhere.
"
FALSE,B,Mission of Burma,Mission of Burma,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5490,"
More even than most postpunk they were also prenoise, harbingers of a rock and roll (or rock) far more traditional than no wave both formally and sonically except that it eschewed (or failed to achieve) melody (or tune). Not indefensible, but less sonically compelling than the defense would have you believe--or so it seems from my generational vantage. Comprising all of Signals, Calls and Marches and Vs. plus the great ""Academy Fight Song"" and lesser arcana, this compilation boasts a new world-record CD length of 80 minutes, which under the sonic-melodic circumstances isn't something to boast about--it goes on for fucking ever. Adepts of the select button need own nothing else. Everybody else should go for what they know.
"
FALSE,B,The Hissing of Summer Lawns,Joni Mitchell,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1844,"
Mitchell's transition from great songwriter to not-bad poet is meeting resistance from her talent and good sense, but I guess you can't fight ""progress."" Not that she's abandoned music--the supple accompaniment here is the most ambitious of her career. But if she wants jazz she could do better than Tom Scott's El Lay coolcats, and the sad truth is that only on a couple of cuts--""The Jungle Line"" and ""Don't Interrupt the Sorrow""--do these skillful sound effects strengthen the lyrics. The result is that Mitchell's words must stand pretty much on their own, and while she can be rewarding to read--""The Boho Dance"" is a lot sharper than most I'm-proud-to-be-a-star songs--she's basically a West Coast Erica Jong. If that sounds peachy to you, enjoy.
"
FALSE,B,Wild Things Run Fast,Joni Mitchell,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1846,"
This is good Joni, for the first time since the mid-'70s, and I suspect it comes too late, because good Joni simply means old Joni, and old Joni is better. I mean, if she'd put ""Solid Love"" at the very end I still wouldn't believe her, but at least I'd think she'd learned something. Instead she proves her maturity with a climactic hymn to St. Paul's kind of love which is much the worst of the three covers--because to be honest the Al Hibbler and Elvis Presley songs are what kept me listening.
"
FALSE,B,Out of Line,Mofungo,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5493,"
Where hardcore kids rail against empty leisure and media images, these working bohemians ground an analysis in the dismal daily grind. Their politics more or less match thick, uningratiating music that is dissonant but not quite amelodic, industrial but not at all mechanical. The match isn't exact because their lyrics are sometimes so simplistic they deserve a single dumb folkie guitar, while the music gets thin in a more unavoidable way, reflecting their blocked access to the means of production. And though I doubt anything would render their ""We're gonna change the world"" literal, my analysis is that a few extra tunes wouldn't hurt.
"
FALSE,B,The Moments Greatest Hits,The Moments,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7456,"
""Love on a Two Way Street"" is this classic falsetto group's only pop breakthrough because it's their only pop tune--Sylvia Robinson gets lots of mileage out of Harry Ray's tenor, but she's not Thom Bell or Eugene Record. For that matter, Ray isn't Russell Thompkins or Eddie kendricks--I love the proto-disco moans on ""Sexy Mama"" and the overarching agony of ""I Do,"" but for the most part he projects a romanticism so transparent that its artificiality shows through. A one-disc selection might work, but two means twenty certified r&amp;b hits that never venture five miles over the speed limit.
"
FALSE,B,Two Sides of the Moon,Keith Moon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7458,"
It's hard to imagine the auteur of this alternately vulgar, silly, and tender travesty/tour de force as anyone but Keith Moon; his madness translates not only to film (Stardust, Tommy) but even to the supersolo studio jobs that this parodies so deliciously. I presume they thought it was funny to mix the backup singers (Nilsson, Nelson, Flo &amp; Eddie) up in front of the guy with his name on the cover. And it was.
"
FALSE,B,Leave the Light On,Lorrie Morgan,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6259,"
With Reba McEntire coming on perkier than Donna Fargo and various young pretenders folkies in disguise, the pseudostrings of this Tammy Wynette-styled throwback are traditional enough to suit me. She'll stand by her man, but not as his love slave, and if ""Out of Your Shoes"" would betray a sisterly premise for a roll in the hay, the unprecedented ""He Talks to Me,"" which climaxes with afterwords, is compensation.
"
FALSE,B,A Period of Transition,Van Morrison,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4097,"
""It Fills You Up"" and ""Heavy Connection"" work on chant power alone, but even they go on a little too long, and in general this is an unexciting record--but not definitively. It's full of the surprising touches--the (borrowed) instrumental intros to the blues that opens side one and the jump tune that opens side two, a throw-in couplet about Amsterdam that might as well have Van's fingerprints on it, and even the can't-always-get-what-you-need chorus on ""Eternal Kansas City""--that signify talent putting out. I don't know; maybe that's depressing proof that this isn't just a warmup. But after three years, let's say it is.

Where you file this de facto best-of from Van's slackest and most spiritual period depends on whether you mourn Astral Weeks or Moondance. I'm putting it in the reference library.
"
FALSE,B,Viva Hate,Morrissey,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5500,"
From my pinnacle of disinterest I can attest that this solo move is neither here nor there. Vini Reilly doesn't have a unique sound like Johnny Marr, and autonomy does encourage the camp grandiosity of a guy who tries to make ""I love you more than life"" live: though he may think it's funny for ""Late Night, Maudlin Street"" to go on for 7:40, in fact it's as boring as you'd expect despite the great line about his revolting nakedness. But the Smiths rarely if ever came up with a hook as must-hear as ""Everyday Is Like Sunday""'s and in general the monotony factor has decreased. The artiste is no longer a kid, and he likes it that way. Essential for acolytes, educational for the rest of us, just like always.
"

These half-legendary reggae veterans deserve a U.S. compilation, but not every hitmaker on an island of two million is guaranteed to lead us into Zion. Bingy Bunny moans guilelessly, a laid-back Winston Rodney, while Flabba Holt and Style Scott keep the riddims so close to earth you have to figure they don't command any chancier options.

It's the same for Sly &amp; Robbie as for Stax-Volt, Gamble &amp; Huff, or for that matter Richard Perry--if a great studio style is going to break out of its formula and zap the listener, the record had better offer identification, inspiration, or hooks. But me, I'm no Rasta, or any other kind of theist or cultural nationalist; are you? And the gain in vocal competence strikes me as a dangerous thing--because Moses always ""projects"" now, he deprives his basic singsong of the nursery-rhyme lucidity that makes his best work so winning.

Moses's singsong melodies have always been simplistic even by reggae standards, but on these cautionary ditties neither lyrics nor groove manage the sly, subtle grace of the best of them. Catchy, yes, and righteous too, but as annoying at times as a Sugar Crisps commercial.

Punks have never bought his leather jacket and indie connections because Lemmy Kilmister's grizzled-biker-born-to-rock is metal without the heavy--no preening solos or blow-dried bullshit. I recommend the bit where he promises to get fast and loose with his latest receptacle as soon as he finishes the song about it (not her, of course not), and note that his writing is more one-note than need be, wit and all--fucking for the hell of it can drive anybody into a rage, and tuneless fucking for the hell of it is really pointless. Anthem: ""(We Are) The Road Crew.""

FALSE,B,Brain Capers,Mott the Hoople,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2467,"
After a debut album that pitted imaginative borrowing against imitative self-expression, Mad Shadows and Wild Life descended thrashing and caterwauling into the depths of rock and roll psychodrama--what could one expect of ""improvisations"" based on such faceless ""originals""? So this is a heartening reverse--not only do they unearth Dion's suppressed farewell to junkiedom, ""Your Own Back Yard,"" and a good old Youngbloods number, but they provide originals that can stand behind them. Unfortunately, the two exceptions take up more than twelve minutes.

""Roll Away the Stone"" and maybe ""Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll"" are classics in their neoclassical mode, which is also to say that they're nothing new, and the marginal stuff is quite undifferentiated. I suspect that Ian Hunter's ego, which he deserves, is crowding out the others. And I know for sure that Ariel Bender flashes more ego than Mick Ralphs ever did, and that he deserves none of it.

FALSE,B,The Best of the Move,The Move,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3731,"
I could trot out the complaint that this double-LP would make a good single, but why bother? Comprising the band's 1967 U.K. debut LP and a lot of uncollected forty-fives, with two sets of notes and detailed discographical data, this is a labor of love that lists at only a buck over the one-record price. Anyway, they wouldn't pick the same cuts I would: my fave is ""Wave Your Flag and Stop the Train,"" which they regard as a Monkees imitation--not a very exact one, I'd say, but close enough to the pop at which they supposedly excelled. I love rock and roll--I just want it to be better. Bands like the Move feel hemmed in by rock and roll--they want it to be different, or more. When they succeed, as the Move finally did, it's often better too. But usually it's less.

How deeply these clever funk lifts and come-hither ululations penetrate your mind-body continuum depends on how deeply you're into big-league fucking, which for these folks seems to involve a confusion between candy and fruit.

Because Garrett's amiable baritone and astringent guitar tend toward blues, this is more coherent Muldaur than either of his Warner solos. And I assume a limited budget curbed some of his sillier experimental fancies, which couldn't have hurt. But his fondness for genteel schlock--tunes by Chopin and Tchaikovsky, a rancid chestnut called ""Beautiful Isle of Somewhere""--still grates.

On side one, the nice tunes from the predictable variety of traditional and contemporary sources are too unfocused to be more than pleasant, but the flip is a modest postfolkie treat. ""Me and My Chauffeur Blues"" shows off Maria's sexiest moods--coy, melancholy, swoony, demanding, and at the end she and her chauffeur come together--while ""Death Letter Blues"" shows off Geoff's most haunted blues voice. In between he camps up ""Brazil,"" she strolls through ""Georgia on My Mind,"" and Jim Kweskin asks Mel Lyman for further instructions.

One accidental if inevitable hit reveals this English jug band as the best novelty group since the Coasters, though the Royal Guardsmen and the Chipmunks aren't what I'd call heavy competition. Great hostling noises, an echo-chamber parody that could make Stan Freberg turn to commercials, and a fair share of dirty talk. But just as Alvin's falsetto used to wear thin after a while, so does Mungo's drawl--and kazoo.

Long after vanishing in the States they were making like the next Creedence over there, releasing six French singles in 1971 alone and cracking top ten in England three more times. Their mood quickly shifted from old- to good-timey, always vaguely entertaining and sometimes on target, as in the affectionate but critical getting-old song ""You Better Leave That Whiskey Alone."" But leader Ray Dorset never showed the kind of acuity as a singer or writer that turns bands into Creedences over here.

The mistake is Paul Rothschild's production, too tasty and anonymous to support the innocence that made Murphy's basically tinny voice and underachieved rock and roll convincing. Deprived of the benefit of the doubt, Murphy's awkward literaryness starts to stick out. You wonder whether his lost generation was really shaped with a ""technicolor carving knife."" You wonder just how much he knows about Eva Braun. You wonder why the two strongest cuts on the record--the love songs on side one--are the ones you notice last. And in the end you hope the next record makes it.

Since her first hit Murray has personified pop at its most unaffected, nice in all the obvious ways--intelligent, cheerful, warm, even wholesome. The strongest of her five albums offers ten realistic, deeply felt songs, including ""You Made My Life a Song,"" the most unpained come-back-if-you-break-up-with-your-new-love I've ever heard. I like every cut. Just wish I loved one.

I worry that my former second-favorite clean-cut female singer will do a Helen Reddy and begin reminding me of Doris Day, but if anything this is a move toward La Vern Baker--""Just One Look"" and ""You Won't See Me"" rock with expected grit. She should have left Kenny Loggins when the leaving was good, and I wish more of her MOR packed as much domestic drama and fresh-air sincerity as ""Another Pot 'o Tea"" or ""Real Emotion,"" but this is her best to date.

It remains a scandal that the most prolific, protean, and flat-out talented of the younger jazzmen still records for an Italian company. But he's got hotter ways to curry Blue Note's favor.

The miraculous ""Pass the Dutchie"" was originally a fine Mighty Diamonds song called ""Pass the Koochie,"" so even though the arrangement is pure genius and the switch from ganja (a koochie is a pipe) to food (a dutchie is a cookpot) pure social responsibility, they've yet to write their first hit. And with reggae bands, not to mention kid bands (even English bands), one-shots are an old story. So I regret to report that the album evinces neither pop songcraft nor the signature groove with which seasoned reggae artists compensate. And am surprised to add that between young Kelvin's biddle-biddle toasts and the reggae songcraft they do command--check out ""Youth of Today"" and ""Young Generation""--they almost get by and then some.

FALSE,B,I Can See Clearly Now,Johnny Nash,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7494,"
Based on a simple, undemanding, slightly syncopated rhythmic figure that sounds like it was lifted from ""Wimoweh"" and is broken only by a chorus of angels, its unremittingly cheerful tag line redeemed by the unexpected realism of ""I can see all obstacles in my way,"" the title song is the first true reggae ever to go top ten in the U.S. It's also the kind of single that can get you through a traffic jam. The album melds Caribbean soul--composer Bob Marley's is the best--with Nash's diffident, church-derived televisable vocal conception. It might get you through a day in the country if all the other available music were by Chuck Mangione.

Wisely, this takes off on specifically aural phenomena: radio above all, but also telephone tapes, other comedy records, and confession. If it were a little looser it would qualify as a '70s update of Firesign's Dear Friends.

What can it mean when all I'm sure of after playing an album a dozen times is that the band likes Wire a lot? But in the end I give them considerable credit for keeping their taut drone on my turntable long past the point when I've sent umpteen similar bands to the warehouse. Which reminds me that in today's permeable musical atmosphere it's conceivable they've never even heard Wire, just Wire's ideas. And actually, I'm also sure they feel ""Hoodwinked,"" the lead cut that kept me coming back after six or seven spins. I bet I even know why they feel hoodwinked. But not because they helped me figure it out. Recommended to rabid formalists and rabid Pink Flag fans.

One NME raver cites Einst������������������rzende Neubauten, which may not turn everybody on but does imply Eurocentrism subjected to underdevelopment and its discontents. I hear a gifted singer making a choppy crossover move. The horns recall the pretentious big-band clutter Dave Crawford and Brad Shapiro worked up for a fading Wilson Pickett, and the tama drum is so far up in the mix it tapdances on the groove. N'Dour's high Islamo-Cuban cry and crack Afro-Gallic byplay generate plenty o""Magninde"" do they avoid fragmented overconceptualization.

FALSE,B,A Horse Called Music,Willie Nelson,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5532,"
Over the four or five albums of a commercial decline that's probably permanent, he's proven more George Jones than Merle Haggard. That is, he's a genius interpreter who always stands a chance of hitting you where you live--even though, like Merle, he still occasionally writes his own, and because of rather than despite the show of laziness the two share. Assuming you can stomach many strings and two pretentious clinkers (the title trope plus one called ""If I Were a Painting""), this is his best of the period, maybe because he put the least effort into it--it's when he tries to sing powerfully, or traffics in concepts like the '50s standards of What a Wonderful World, that he flounders. Sometimes, of course, his modest efforts come across flat; sometimes, no doubt, they really are lazy. But most of these murmured tributes to good love getting better and gone bad are touching and apt.

As a staunch admirer of ""You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd"" who's had less than no use for Miller since he got serious, I'm almost persuaded by this tribute-to-the-composer cum duo quickie. In fact, one more standout like ""Old Friends"" (including Ray Price), ""Sorry Willie"" (didn't know you thought she was your darlin'), and ""When a House Is Not a Home"" (one of Nelson's patented dry-eyed weepers) would make the difference.

""I love it here on the range,"" the Smart Monkee yodels, but then he adds that he'd ""love it more if it changed,"" which sums up his country-rock synthesis quite nicely. I don't know if he's serious about this ""free from euphemisms and alive with their own emotions"" stuff he writes about in the notes, but one reason I like his songs is that they never seem to mean exactly what they say--even ""Joanne,"" which could be covered by Paul Butterfield or Linda Ronstadt or somebody, partakes of the bemused natural distance that saves his more aimless experiments from getting lost.

Backed by bass and drums from 10,000 Maniacs of Jamestown, New York, James Scott Reilly and Reese Edward Campbell Jr. of Warren, Pennsylvania, make songs out of the shopping malls and bad marriages of their shitty little town (well, that's what they seem to think). Their Byrdsy hooks (out of R.E.M., by 10,000 Maniacs) decorate dense yet literal lyrics--lyrics whose specifics sour as you listen.

Six of these fourteen wonderful songs are on Newman's first album and four on his second, all set off by the arrangements that are the other half of his gift, none crippled by one-take vocals.

The State Department says they can't tour the U.S.--""no artistic merit."" You can understand why they think this reflects on their politics, which are in the old English tradition of left chauvinism--they hate consumer blandishments with a passion that springs not from their readings in Hans Magnus Enzensberger but from a natural militance that deplores softness in class allies. Such an ideology would exclude artistic merit in the minds of most bureaucrats (as indeed would many other ideologies, not to mention the presence of electric guitars), and that's abhorrent. I'd be hard-pressed to argue compelling positive distinction on an often plodding football-punk sort of album, its words sharper in tone and spirit than content. But I'd give it a try.

Once you get past the underwhelming Jo'burg-goes-B'way rhythm section and the overpowering Jo'burg-takes-B'way chorus, Ngema's background as a township guitarist makes itself heard. The man projects so powerfully that you begin to think his political commitment, theatrical gifts, and way with South African English could make mbaqanga a truly international style. Then you notice that while in Sarafina! the girls take over, the villains of these pieces--a golddigger, an aborter, and an informer--are all women. Ain't contradiction the shits?

A more ideologically suggestive title than the British Separates for a band that kicks off a very listenable (or jumpable) side by declaring ""I believe in homicide"" and ends it by warning ""crime don't pay."" In other words, all but hard-and-fast punk loyalists are liable to find this a bit thin.

I've never quite gotten with the abbreviation. New doesn't mean cute, or fancy, or at least it shouldn't, and rhythm-and-blues doesn't mean this. I don't understand why they turned the Q into Quintet by adding singer Frank Gadler, either--all he's ever added is more cuteness, even doing a John Sebastian on one cut. They're tuneful as hell, but so arch--""Who Put the Garlic in the Glue?"" indeed--that the only tune I can bear to contemplate is ""Magnet."" Which attracts me like one. See, they've got me doing it. Yuk.

FALSE,B,Workshop,NRBQ,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7532,"
This band continues to live up to its full name (now Quartet rather than Quintet again), suggesting a cross between a chamber group (virtuosity and rhythmic decorum) and the New Lost City Ramblers (intelligent folkiness). Terry Adams plays rock and roll like a man who knows jazz wasn't invented by Chick Corea, and I do enjoy their sense of humor--the organ pumping into ""C'Mon if You're Coming,"" or the out-of-synch, out-of-timbre Adams blues piano that undercuts ""Blues Stay Away From Me."" But I get no sense of why they engage in this musicianly reconstruction of r&amp;b tradition; the jokes, none of which would make Carson, are what there is of a point. And if I'm going to listen to rock and roll without overdrive I need more reason than that.

They really are virtuosos of fun, a major accomplishment that makes for minor records. They're so dedicated to the perpetual adolescence of pure (or purist) rock and roll that they imitate youth--Joey Spampimato is the most egregious coy-boy in this band of players first and singers second--rather than redefining youthfulness, a more appropriate task for artists of their advancing years. I know they're only kidding (har har), but at some level these are guys who still believe a real girl (not woman, please) sews your shirt and shines your shoes.

The first live album by the Northeast's finest road band stands a chance of showing the rest of the world what it's been missing. It also runs the risk of revealing how the rest of the world managed to stay away. Face it, fans--expecting the same old unexpected can deaden the synapses too, and 20 years can put the snazziest key changes and time signatures in a rut.

""Fuck tha Police"" is a fantasy, ""Fuck with me I'll put my foot in your ass"" an exaggeration, ""Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money"" a home truth, and I bet Ice Cube gets more pussy now than when he copped the line.

All second-rate soul singers are creatures of their arrangements; what makes it harder to pin Billy down is that these days a lot of first-rate soul singers are also creatures of their arrangements. ""When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going"" and ""Get Outta My Dreams Get Into My Car"" not only hold the record for the most uses of a verb other than ""love"" in a great hit and its de facto follow-up, they're also a great hit and its de facto follow-up.

Over and above Irish-American backlash and papal maledictions from the depths of the catacombs, this muddled project stiffed because no one understood it, possibly including O'Connor. At least half the titles aren't ""standards."" I mean, Rice &amp; Webber? Early Loretta Lynn? ""Scarlet Ribbons""? An anticlericalist sermon? A putative Marilyn Monroe song that made a bigger splash when Helen Kane did it in 1928? A samba? Doris Day's ""Secret Love"" (which as it happens was the first record I ever bought, though I came to prefer the B side, ""The Deadwood Stage"")? All they share (except for the sermon) is that they are not rock (and also, conceivably, that O'Connor grew up with them, as she claims). But unlike La Ronstadt, O'Connor has no not-rock audience, and little not-rock savvy. Instead of hiring some reasonable substitute for Nelson Riddle--Billy May, or her Red Hot + Blue crew--she relies on high-grade hacks like Torrie Zito and Rob Mounsey. Even thorough their blare she sounds so defiant, so vulnerable, so sexual that at times she could be the greatest natural singer since Aretha. So up till the last three cuts, she almost gets away with it. But she doesn't.

On Westbound they were experimentalists whether copying Funkadelic or Cactus. Not that all the experiments were interesting, much less successful, or that a hit format displays them at their best--I'd welcome a second long jam in addition to the two-part ""Pain."" Which is one of the three successful as opposed to interesting songs on this compilation. The others are ""Ecstasy,"" after the manner of George Clinton, and ""Funky Worm,"" impersonated by Junie Morrison.
"
FALSE,B,Ship Ahoy,The O'Jays,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7553,"
Every time side two gets rolling my ass tells my brain to go away--""For the Love of Money"" is that great, although it's all (gradually) downhill from there. But when I put on side one my brain kicks back in, and my brain is right--not a song I ever want to hear again.
"
FALSE,B,O'Keefe,Danny O'Keefe,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7560,"
Arif Mardin has neutralized O'Keefe's folk-Muzak potential by embellishing it--better his studio-rock ""Good Time Charlie"" than Ahmet's folkie-rockie-with-flute one, and not just because it got O'Keefe on the radio. In a neon romantic like O'Keefe--who sounds most at home telling junkie stories or covering ""Honky Tonkin'""--spectral percussion, a steel guitar mixed for eerieness, even a clarinet function as intelligent new-schlock shading that acknowledges his fundamental commercialism. And commercial he is--just about every song has a melodic hook. Though we'd be better off without one on ""Shooting Star"" (""the morning is waiting for Electra""?) and ""The Valentine Pieces"" (don't ask).
"
FALSE,B,Get Outta School,Old Skull,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5571,"
With their shrill tantrums and chaotic coherence, these three nine-yes-nine-year-olds win a hardcore novelty prize on aptness of sound alone. Shit does stand out, too: ""Hot Dog Hell"" (""Whoever works here doesn't know how to cook a hot dog""), ""Kill a Dead Eagle"" (""You can't kill a dead eagle/Just like you can't kill a devil with a bomb""), ""Homeless"" (""I hate you, Ronald Reagan""), and especially ""AIDS."" ""We don't know that much about AIDS,"" they sing, for all of us. ""How does it make you feel?/I feel afraid.""

From the Timexes who gave the world the new improved S.O.S. Band, a new improved black matinee idol. They start one side with a can't-miss postvulnerable ballad, the other with a can't-miss dance song deceptively entitled ""Innocent."" The rest they leave to craft. Is this any way to serve a new improved matinee idol? Probably.

FALSE,B,In Dreams: The Greatest Hits,Roy Orbison,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5578,"
From Chuck Berry on Mercury to the reunited Everlys, rerecorded best-ofs like this one rarely deliver magic or chops. The youthful buoyancy that kept the melodrama from getting soggy is in short supply, and without much trade-off in the standard interpretive nuance. A quarter-century later, his voice still socks and soars, and if on some songs--""Pretty Woman"" of course, ""Blue Bayou,"" ""Candy Man""--it's clear that only the original artyfact will do, nobody who wasn't there would swear to the general inferiority of this marginally more tasteful recreation. After all, just exactly how great were his hits? Crowning him rock's first neurotic is as overwrought as damning Donald Duck for a protofascist--pop-rock (cum countrypolitan) self-pity has its own conventions just like slapstick did, and he is their slave. So as a heretic who isn't positive Phil Spector was good for rock and roll, and also as a heretic who was there, I'll stick with the artyfacts after all. They're certainly no worse. And versions you don't need.
"
FALSE,B,Mystery Girl,Roy Orbison,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5579,"
If you're guessing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity squandered by the assembled bigshots, guess again. They've done their man's tradition proud. Problem's the tradition--just listen to the latest Rhino retrospective, which celebrates its inevitable schlockification at MGM, and you'll know why Orbison's comeback was made for this corporate era. When he gets a great tune produced just right--Wilbury-penned lead hit, Bono-Edge title ballad, Waylon's ""In Dreams"" sequel--his unassuming seriousness can make you think twice about opera. But with his mythic voice no longer distinguishing surely between tenderness and sentimentality, ""A Love So Beautiful"" and ""Windsurfer"" are bathos. And when Elvis C. leaves him stranded atop a ferris wheel and he just sits there contemplating his tragedy in song, the only thing mythic is the scale of the self-parody.
"
FALSE,B,Junk Culture,Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2628,"
Now that they've come down a little I can take their sad tales of hard days seriously. Even on ""Junk Culture"" proper, which stirs up memories of their direct atmospherics, they do their best to cheese things up, and elsewhere hurdy-gurdy synths and android girlies emitting no-no-nos do right by the title, a title anybody who once dubbed an album Architecture and Morality had damn well better earn.

"
FALSE,B,Emotional,Jeffrey Osborne,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5582,"
I'm trying to figure out what it means to say I kind of like this record, a big-budget multiproducer job of the sort suddenly standard in crossoverland. It's not just that I'm impressed with all the heavy equipment, from Osborne's dolomite voice to the usual phalanx of hitmen turning out materiel. I respond--that's one thing kind of liking it means. And though the response feels synthetic, it's not unreal. Which is just what I'd say of the emotions on display, from be-mine to Soweto-must-be-free.

FALSE,B,Osibisa,Osibisa,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7567,"
""Criss-cross rhythms that explode with happiness,"" promises this London-based African and West Indian troupe, but they can't leave it at that, and neither singer-guitarist Wendell Richardson nor singer-saxophonist Teddy Osei explodes with very much of anything. Which leaves it all up to an ensemble that often sounds a little muddled--though I'll always stop and listen to the strange, sour unison horn line and unhappy lyric of ""Phallus C.""
"
FALSE,B,80's Ladies,K.T. Oslin,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1970,"
After ""Do Ya',"" side two is dreck, squeezing its sob stories down to the last overripe chord change, but when she asserts herself this countrypolitan career woman can tell you more about the vagaries of erotic love than two male neotraditionalists half her age combined. Not surprisingly, she asserts herself only when she writes a song all by her lonesome--on ""80's Ladies,"" ""Younger Men,"" and ""Do Ya'"" too. And the only tune she didn't have a hand in is a sob story that should convert anyone who thinks lady songwriters shouldn't launch singing careers in the prime of life. A voice she's got.
"
FALSE,B,This Woman,K.T. Oslin,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5583,"
The songwriting may never kick in full time, though it sure has its moments--when a girl with a new used car invites a cute young thing out for a spin, or a single begins her status report with a quiet ""I'm overworked and I'm overweight."" But there are other reasons to root for this full-timbred New York-based outsider--not only does she challenge Nashville's hidebound gender roles, but she doesn't cotton to neotraditionalist canons. In fact, her music hints at pop, and if you think that has to mean schlock or rock, don't tell the guitarists.
"
FALSE,B,Phase III,The Osmonds,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11258,"
No, I'm not being perverse. In fact, the first side to this lp--which includes two great singles (""Yo-Yo"" and ""Down by the Lazy River"") and two good white soul-rockers and an acceptable-plus ballad--is such great AM music that I'm tempted to go higher. Unfortunately, the other side is a stinker, from Jesus-rock to studio jollity. One album a year and they might be very good indeed.
"
FALSE,B,Himself,Gilbert O'Sullivan,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7571,"
I admit I ignored this until the advent of the genius single ""Alone Again (Naturally),"" which I like best for the way its tossed-off structure matches its casual, crucial equation of filial and romantic affection. But I insist I was always intrigued by the idea of a singer-songwriter managed by the same godfather who brings us Tom Jones and Englebert Humperdinck. He's uneven, and he may turn into a major annoyance, but before that happens we ought to acknowledge that he's also a complete original. Persona: insecure lower middle-class Irishman with a screw loose. Message: it's normal to have a screw loose. Rhymes: ""Nothing Rhymed.""
"
FALSE,B,Are You Ready?,Pacific Gas & Electric,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11581,"

Like most collegiate humor, this isn't as funny as it thinks it is, and like most collegiate humor it holds up against competing professional product. ""Farm Rap"" is recommended to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""No Dick"" to the Meatmen. And from nerd-macho proem through lyric-sheet verses to the climactically yearning chorus of ""I want to play hide-the-salami with you,"" the magnificent ""I Want to Make Love to You"" is on a level with Spinal Tap itself.

Here's Robert Welch, the American rock singer who joined Fleetwood Mac in 1971 and quit in frustration in 1975. His second LP--smooth and hard-rocking, or course--is perfect for Fleetwood Mac fans nostalgic for Mystery to Me. Wherever you are.
"
FALSE,B,Another Grey Area,Graham Parker,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5589,"
Mixed success isn't becoming to Parker, who can no longer blame his bad personality on unemployment. By replacing the Rumour with studio regulars, he's lost the edgy drive that used to help his bitterness cut through, and his revitalized melodic craft only takes him so far--if hooks don't justify kneejerk sentimentality, they don't justify jerkoff paranoia either.
"
FALSE,B,"I Tell Stories Sad and True, I Sing the Blues and Play Harmonica Too, It Is Very Funky",Junior Parker,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5618,"
Once a big man on the blues circuit, Parker was turning into the forgotten Beale Streeter by the time he died last year, and this is a respectful farewell--Sonny Lester, who wrecked his recent collaboration with Jimmy McGriff, keeps things simple (well, fairly simple). Never as penetrating as B.B. or Bobby, Parker smooths his way over the arrangements with the calm of a man who was mellow before the concept existed, at least in its present deracinated form. Highlight: the sad, true story that goes with ""Funny How Time Slips Away.""
"
FALSE,B,Woman Out of Control,Ray Parker Jr.,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5785,"
""I Still Can't Get Over Loving You,"" his sweetest, sexiest hit ballad ever, rips Brit synth-pop as shamelessly as ""The Other Woman"" ripped the Stones, but his grip becomes less definitive on the very next tune, which barely loosens the hem of Prince's garment. And side two holds on strictly to Ray's tried and true.
"
FALSE,B,Play Me or Trade Me,Parlet,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5790,"
Even though P-Funk's second-string auxiliary has no Dawn Silva or Jeanette McGruder, this comes on as strong as Never Buy Texas From a Cowboy, because it doesn't take much for funk to come on strong. Just a few dance-phrases is all--""help from my friends,"" ""play me or trade me,"" ""now button it up, I'll put it away."" Endurance is something else. Watch them do their thang indeed.
"
FALSE,B,Osmium,Parliament,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2665,"
What happens when a black harmony group names an album after the heaviest metal, depluralizes its name, and pluralizes its music? It may be pretentious bullshit, but it sure is interesting pretentious bullshit--bagpipes and steel guitars, Bach and rock, Satchmo as Kingfish, work chants as dozens, all in the service of a world view in which love/sex becomes frightening, even brutal, and no less credible for that.
"
FALSE,B,Chocolate City,Parliament,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2667,"
On the first side A DJ who reminds me of original AM scatman Jocko Henderson jive-raps on the satisfactions of suffrage and then gives way to a danceable, listenable, forgettable groove. On the second side, interesting but hookless off-harmony excursions, two of them too slow and/or too long, break into some heavy funk for the ages.
"
FALSE,B,Bubbling Over,Dolly Parton,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5623,"
A better-than-average Parton album in many ways, but beyond the usual dull spots two cuts really bother me. Often her genteel aspirations are delightful--who else would pronounce it ""o'er our heads,"" just like in poetry books, instead of slurring ""over""? But when her sentimentality becomes ideological--""Babies save marriages,"" or ""Stop protesting and get right with God""--you remember why most great popular artists have rebelled against gentility.
"
FALSE,B,Love Is Like a Butterfly,Dolly Parton,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5625,"
Except for the title tune, the only really interesting songs here are two by Porter Wagoner--Dolly's already done a whole album of ""Take Me Back,"" and ""Bubbling Over"" is a lot more effervescent than ""Gettin' Happy."" Still, she repeats herself (and apes others) nicely enough. And blues strings followed by gospel medley rescues side two at the close.
"
FALSE,B,White Limozeen,Dolly Parton,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5794,"
The crossover that marked her new label affiliation never got to the other side, so she lets Ricky Skaggs call the shots--these days he's commercial. Except on the Easter song, he cans the production numbers, and since she can still sing like a genius anytime opportunity knocks, her most country album in years is also her best. Of course, even genius country singers are dragged by ordinary country songs. And though the borrowings are better-than-average, she no longer writes like a pro without help--here provided by, such is life, Mac Davis.
"
FALSE,B,Heroes,Tom Paxton,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5631,"
As dinky musically as any other electric folk session, but most of the songs escape the sentimental self-righteousness you expect from this old-timer. They're funny when they mean to be, which is often. And two very impressive farewells, to Phil Ochs and Stephen Biko, aren't funny at all.
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Freda Payne,Freda Payne,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5633,"
Recommended to those who neglected to purchase ""Band of Gold"" (wedding-night impotence!) and/or ""Bring the Boys Home"" (Vietnam with violins! a black sister calling out for peace with her brother content to exhort from the background!), which together with two familiar-sounding tunes by label-owners Holland-Dozier-Holland and two entertaining soap operas make for as nice a side of minor Motown as you're likely to get from the original these days.

FALSE,B,Teddy Pendergrass,Teddy Pendergrass,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5642,"
In the immediate wake of Teddy's break with Harold Melvin, this sounded like pure cop-'em cut-'em con-'em and account-'em, but time quickly proved it an ordinary quickie. That is, the first two tunes on each side, estimable though they are, aren't what make you forget the last two. It's the last two that make you forget the last two.

FALSE,B,Teddy,Teddy Pendergrass,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5643,"
Whether he's flexing his chest at Madison Square Garden or inviting the (presumably female) listener into his shower, Teddy has a self-deprecating sense of humor that his obsessive male posturing tends to obscure. Call him butch rather than macho and be thankful for small favors.
"
FALSE,B,The Penguin Cafe Orchestra Mini Album,Penguin Cafe Orchestra,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5600,"
Simon Jeffes outlines a music from everywhere that could easily turn into a music for nowhere: ""music which is influenced by the above [classical, rock, jazz, folk] but also by African, Japanese, Venezuelan, Celtic (Scottish and Irish), Cajun, Reggae, and other sources."" But where Paul Winter, whose program isn't all that dissimilar, is half pundit and half mooncalf, Jeffes's gentle wit, unmystical posture, and fondness for urban life combat vague-out. Whether he also reaches the ""heart of our own time and culture,"" however, is another matter. His eccentric post-folk orchestrations seem more like escapes to me--into fantasy, into a future with reassuring connections to the past. Which makes this an odd piece of product. ""The Penguin Cafe Single"" is more useful here than the premature Music From the Penguin Cafe. The two new pieces are simple, charming, and very slight. And the three finest tunes, two in new but hardly definitive live versions, are also available on the nonmini album they put out in 1981, the length of which better suits the leisurely pace of Jeffes's panpop impressionism.
"
FALSE,B,Carl Perkins and NRBQ,Carl Perkins and NRBQ,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5647,"
This is uniformly pleasant, but Carl can't wear those shoes no more--he's an aging country singer who sounds it. And since he wrote about half of these tunes as well as singing half of them, we might mention that for the most part he's a competent and utterly unexciting composer. As for NRBQ, their jumpy version of that blues-bopping beat merges all too well with the novelty-music aspect of rockabilly--at times this sounds an itty bit cute. Cute and I like them: Terry Adams's hippie pastorale, ""On the Farm,"" and a Perkins guitar showpiece called ""Just Coastin'.""
"
FALSE,B,Street Corner Symphony,The Persuasions,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5652,"
If you believe acappella is inherently superior to ""commercial"" rock and roll, you'll prefer the Persuasions' covers to the Sam Cooke and Impressions and Temptations originals. But if you think it's an eccentric alternative, you'll note that Jerry Lawson's style is a punchier, less delicate variation on the sweet gutturals of David Ruffin, who himself barely gets by--with skillful help from Norman Whitfield--on a grade-B ballad like ""I Could Never Love Another.""
"
FALSE,B,We Still Ain't Got No Band,The Persuasions,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5653,"
On their r&amp;b album they go head to head with Jimmy Reed and outdo Sam Cooke as well as unearthing a doowop standard that Don Robey probably doesn't remember he wrote (if he did). They also go head to head with the Impressions, the Drifters, and the Coasters. And unearth a soul substandard by one Jimmy Hughes that will live on in the memory of Jimmy Hughes's mother.
"
FALSE,B,Disco,Pet Shop Boys,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2748,"
Serious about not being taken seriously, they set Shep Pettibone (or is that Pet Sheppibone?) to remixing their greatest hit, then ask Pet/Shep, Arthur Baker, and the Latin Rascals to remix three other fairly nifty songs from the only album they've ever released. Just for variety, the lead cuts are the B sides from their great hit and their lesser hit, and I confess I'm glad to own both, brand names and all. Also, ""West End Girls"" does hold up quite nicely for 9:03. Still . . .
"
FALSE,B,You're Gonna Get It!,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5613,"
"". . . might sound strange/Might seem dumb,"" Tom warns at the outset, and unfortunately he only gets it right the second time: despite his Southern roots and '60s pop-rock proclivities, he comes on like a real made-in-L.A. jerk. Onstage, he acts like he wants to be Ted Nugent when he grows up, pulling out the cornball arena-rock moves as if they had something to do with the kind of music he makes; after all, one thing that made the Byrds and their contemporaries great was that they just got up there and played. Thank God you don't have to look at a record, or read its interviews. Tuneful, straight-ahead rock and roll dominates the disc, and ""I Need to Know,"" which kicks off side two, is as peachy-tough as power pop gets. There are even times when Tom's drawl has the impact of a soulful moan rather than a brainless whine. But you need a lot of hooks to get away with being full of shit, and Tom doesn't come up with them.
"
FALSE,B,Hard Promises,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5609,"
Hard to gainsay the class solidarity of a rich rock star who sues his record company to keep his list price down to $8.98. And glancing at the lyric sheet, I was pleased to note that the antiboho number--""Kings Road,"" in which a Pakistani tries to sell Tom funny-looking English underwear--had a lighter touch than usual. The reason I hadn't noticed, unfortunately, is that Petty clobbers the thing like he's singing about how much he hates the road. Elsewhere he's more understated, fortunately, but it just goes to show you--no matter how much they respect the working fan, rich rock stars do tend to fill up on themselves.
"
FALSE,B,From a Whisper to a Scream,Esther Phillips,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5662,"
The idea is for her to go pop in two opposite directions--(black) rock material, which is good, and slick arrangements, which aren't. So while it's gratifying to hear her tackle Allen Toussaint, Marvin Gaye, and Gil Scott-Heron, whose song about a junkie with no reason to kick is her tour de force, Creed Taylor proves a thankless producer. It's not just the strings, but the way their simple syrup is played against climaxes that pack all the excitement of an escalator.
"
FALSE,B,"Alone Again, Naturally",Esther Phillips,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5663,"
Here Phillips gets too cocky with her song choices. By eschewing the piano hook, she covers ""Use Me"" without making you fantasize about Bill Withers. But Gladys Knight still owns ""I Don't Want to Do Wrong."" And Gilbert O'Sullivan still owns ""Alone Again, Naturally.""
"
FALSE,B,What a Diff'rence a Day Makes,Esther Phillips With Beck,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5665,"
When it works, Phillips's music balances good songs and a good beat. This time her new arranger tries to push her over into a disco groove, so it's not surprising that some of this sounds a little untracked.
"
FALSE,B,I Enjoy Being a Girl,Phranc,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5673,"
The first uncloseted lesbian to bed down with a major label since Isis, and what does she come up with? The cover design of the year and an album so arch it crumbles without a proscenium. Not that she never gets away with it--the chamber-styled Toys R Us tribute and the praisesong to Martina that spells out her nation of origin are worth hearing even after you know the jokes. Moreover, the few ""sincere"" numbers disappear instantly. But any record that makes its most effective political statement on behalf of child-eating polar bears is resorting to weirdness as a protective device.
"
FALSE,B,Right On,Wilson Pickett,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5675,"
It's good that Pickett is tempering his pricky masculinity with gospel compassion, but not so good that he's softening his edge. ""Sugar Sugar"" (which is fun) plus ""Hey Joe"" (which is I'm not sure) do not equal ""Hey Jude.""
"
FALSE,B,A Funky Situation,Wilson Pickett,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5680,"
Pickett's halfhearted disco move won't go over at the Loft, but it sure beats anything he did for RCA. ""Changed my clothes, but I didn't change my soul,"" he assures us, and that's it exactly. The production (by Rick Hall and Don Daily) and especially the horn arrangements (by Harrison Calloway, Jr.) are dense and eventful rather than overblown and crowded, and unlike so much disco they're designed only to kick ass, never to engulf and wash over. What's more, Pickett is singing again--rarely does he resort to the random scream. His own ""Lay Me Like You Hate Me"" is a startling distillation of what he's always really been about, and though most of the other songs are just ordinary-plus, they've been chosen with obvious care--no song-factory seconds here.
"
FALSE,B,The Dark Side of the Moon,Pink Floyd,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2774,"
With its technological mastery and its conventional wisdom once-removed, this is a kitsch masterpiece--taken too seriously by definition, but not without charm. It may sell on sheer aural sensationalism, but the studio effects do transmute David Gilmour's guitar solos into something more than they were when he played them. Its taped speech fragments may be old hat, but for once they cohere musically. And if its pessimism is received, that doesn't make the ideas untrue--there are even times, especially when Dick Parry's saxophone undercuts the electronic pomp, when this record brings its cliches to life, which is what pop is supposed to do, even the kind with delusions of grandeur.

FALSE,B,Surfer Rosa,The Pixies,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5690,"
By general consensus the Amerindie find of the year, and I'll say this for them: they're OK. Aurally articulate but certainly not clean, much less neat, with guitar riffs you actually notice and a strong beat that doesn't owe any subgenre. Feature a woman as equal partner--no separatism or blatant gender aggression. If I was on the lookout for contemporaries who proved my world wasn't coming to an end, I might overrate them too. In fact, maybe I still do.

FALSE,B,Made in USA,Pizzicato Five,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2778,"
Avant-pop fixtures in Japan, they're considerably more skillful than our home-grown lounge-wave bands. And despite sonics brittler than anything fashioned by Juan Garcia Esquivel, their fondness for post-1963 black dance music insures a better beat. But they have an attitude problem: an affectlessness that renders them more unreadable than Madonna or John Waters or the Pet Shop Boys or any other pop ironyworker except Saint Andy, who both invented the stance and did more with it. It's my policy never to give an inch to recording artists who say things like, ""Without the visuals, people wouldn't understand us."" And although I might get it if I were Japanese, I'm not. In fact, I could even surmise that their failure to reveal the emotional core that glints out from Madonna and Waters and especially the Pet Shop Boys bespeaks a repressed culture that has zero claim on an alien's empathy. But I won't.

Plant's recreations of Led Zep's sonic feel with more mundane musicians is quite impressive, always the operative superlative with him. It's also more insinuatingly hooky than Led Zep ever was. But the insinuation makes one wonder what's being insinuated, which brings one to the question of meaning, which brings one full circle back to almost nowhere.
"
FALSE,B,Now and Zen,Robert Plant,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5692,"
Plant's two earlier solo albums were striking and forgettable--bankable self-indulgences that turned a profit on brand loyalty alone. Because they had the virtue of existing, they inspired loose talk about who ""really"" led his former band, probably from people who secretly believed pomp made the band artistic. This time he looks to solidify his future by imitating his past--even sampling it, an idea he says he got from Rick Rubin (what a card), or hiring his former band's guitarist for a solo. At its best, it's far from forgettable. Overall effect is a cross between his former band and the Cars.

After I secured a CD, with both digital definition and the lyric sheet Island pulled from the vinyl correcting their chronic incomprehensibility, this phonogram finally began to make sense to me. But the horns still betoken folk-rockers moving on rather than the brass bands I bet they're supposed to evoke.

Not to be confused with Regatta de Blanc, I don't think, this is where the latest vanguard of musicianly postminimalist abandons all pretense of pop (or reggae) mindlessness. Stewart Copeland's rhythms skank plenty while looting the whole wide world. Andy Summers's guitar harmonies are blatantly off-color, his melodic effects blatantly exotic. And Sting's words are about stuff--itchy general, teacher not petting with teacher's pet, plus, ahem, the perils of stardom. Summing it all up is their first true hit and only true masterpiece: ""De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da.""

The same sopranos who sound so right choraling through coproducer Philip Glass's rockish hypnorhythm pieces make this arty dance-rock band sound like, dare I say it, disco. At other points the music whispers, I feel constrained to add, Philip Glass. The strangulated vocals I blame on, who else, David Byrne. That it almost gets over anyway is a credit to crescendo techniques developed by, that's right, the Feelies--who could have used some coproduction themselves.

First you sing real good, and then maybe they let you be a house nigger. Pride's amazing baritone--it hints at twang and melisma simultaneously, and to call it warm is to slight the brightness of its heat--loses focus as he settles exclusively into ""heart songs."" Though these tales of married love are worthy enough, only ""Is Anybody Goin' to San Antone"" ranks with ""Does My Ring Hurt Your Finger"" or ""Just Between You and Me"" or ""All I Have to Offer You,"" while ""I'm Just Me"" asserts an ""identity"" so vague it couldn't get him a tricycle license. In however irrelevant a way, ""Kaw-Liga"" at least acknowledged the existence of race, and ""The Snakes Crawl at Night"" at least cast him as a criminal. Neither was much to retreat from.

All these postdadaists want is to provide the forbidden visceral thrill of rock and roll at the moment they snatch it away as an impossible fake--to be the-thing and not-the-thing simultaneously. How much more could they ask of life? They have fair success, too, commanding an impressive palette of horrible noises and effectuating a pretty good beat for art-rock. But what you remember in the end is the snatch; you're left to mull over a concept that will thrill only those whose lived experience verifies it.

Best cut: Allen Toussaint's ""What Is Success,"" about the ""so necessary"" spiritual expenditures entered above a record company's bottom line. Whereupon Raitt pays her tribute to schlock four times over. Typically, she can uncover a stirring moment in the most stillborn possible-single, but the limits of her integrity have already been defined by three flexible, often playful, yet obviously uncompromising albums, and when the strings and woodwinds rise up, they dispossess her. Even ""What Is Success"" suffers a setback when Raitt accedes to Toussaint's impersonal ""he."" That's no ""he,"" Bonnie--that's you.

""A lot of people were probably wondering when they heard about the pairing whether I was going to make a funk record like Was (Not Was),"" Bonnie surmises. Right--loyalists were shaking in their boots, I was licking my lips, and now the suspense is over, unfortunately. She deserves respect, not the obeisance she gets from career sicko Don Was, who fashions an amazing simulation of the El Lay aesthetic she helped perfect and we all thought he hated. Bonnie being Bonnie, it sounds perfectly OK, but most of the songs are so subtly crafted they disappear under her tender loving ministrations, and though Was lets her play guitar for the whole first side, his studio pros could just as well be Peter Asher's.

She oversings, the band's ordinary, and the lyrics (both hers and those she chooses) often get blowzy; the only grade-A cuts are ""Jerry's Pigeons"" and (A plus) ""The Sweetest One."" So maybe I'm soft--maybe I just can't resist a real New York doll. In a woman who combines the hip cool of Lou Reed with the emotionality of Springsteen, a case of Joplinitis--a rare disease these days--is rather endearing.

An exemplary, super-functional version of Eurodisco's electronic dream--synthesizers and power plectrums overlaid with what disco people call rock vocals. This last means you can tell it's a white man singing, and whoever emotes the uptempo stuff sure does sound like Mick Jagger alongside the gigolo imitator on ""My Desire."" Consistently spacey and sexy, the way this music is supposed to be, and who says it's apolitical?

Here they extend themselves thematically, and while it ain't bad for what it is, what it is is arty satire--""Sloths"" is smarter than ""The Devil Lives in My Husband's Body,"" but if it were really smart I couldn't make the comparison. Lora Logic has flown, as is her wont, leaving Mayo Thompson to vocalize, with the result that the same song which nails Jackson Pollock on the first album leaves me feeling sympathetic in this version. To paraphrase Pollock: ""An Englishman's an Englishman in thought and act/And you'd expect this analysis to be qualified by that fact.""

But it's 1980, and this ain't no soul group, and for better or worse, writing (not to mention singing) isn't what funk groups are about, as three slow ones that would have stymied even Otis III's dad demonstrate. Playing is what funk groups are about, and if you don't believe me, listen to Otis III on ""Doin' It"" and ""Funkin' on the One"" or Dexter anywhere.

FALSE,B,I Don't Know How to Love Him,Helen Reddy,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7610,"
Reddy applies a lean pop voice almost devoid of grit or melisma to what are basically rock songs--that is, songs conceived grittily and melismatically. At her best, as in the unadorned interpretations of ""Crazy Love"" and ""A Song for You,"" she sounds refreshingly clear-eyed. At her worst, on Mac Davis's ""I Believe in Music,"" she sounds like a Sunday School teacher pretending to be one of the girls. And the rest of the time she's holding gentility to a draw, or vice versa, as when the cellos that set up ""How Can I Be Sure"" turn into the violins that schmaltz it around.

FALSE,B,I Am Woman,Helen Reddy,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7611,"
The hit added many instruments and one conciliatory stanza to the debut-LP version, which may be the way the Grammy bounces but is also how Reddy's feeling these days. She is wife, with baby son and marital crisis behind her, and she's enjoying her success. Tom Catalano's discreet schlock is right for a celebration of connubial privacy like Kenny Rankin's ""Peaceful"" because it implies the affluence underlying her domestic contentment. This time, at least, the production doesn't drown out Reddy's essential intelligence, compassion, and confidence. But avoiding complacency may prove a problem.

The sound is New Order meets Test Dept., with singer Chris Reed having it both ways. Always a skeptic in re dirges, I wish they'd picked up the pace with a single like ""Spinning Round.""

In which Mr. Heroin promotes the '60s. Really. Just compare the studio-Velvets first side with the hodgepodge-Arista closer and tell me he wasn't more confidently himself--I mean happier--negating optimism than fumbling through its aftermath. Admittedly, beyond the inescapable ""Street Hassle"" the Arista song choices are perverse even for Lou--three from his album of six months ago, neither great one among them. And beyond the inescapable ""Walk on the Wild Side"" the RCA choices aren't much more coherent (cf. RCA's own Walk on the Wild Side). So Clive's minions hire Ellen Willis to make sense of it all--which, striving almost too mightily, she almost does.

But musically he's trying too hard with no place to go--projects the opener from midway down the esophagus as if Street Hassle leads to Street-Legal, then doesn't even stick with that. Mostly these are intelligent songs that misfire slightly. The two gems are two of the simplest both verbally and vocally. In one Lou's father gives him shit while his mother dies. In the other he proposes.

This veteran writer-producer has his soul in the right place--Miami, as far south as he can get it. And though he's a/k/a Blow Fly, purveyor of parody porn, the true Reid is as unyielding a moralist as Porter Wagoner or Ernest Tubb. He cheats a lot, just like his daddy, but he also pays--in one song, his ""real woman"" goes off to find ""a real man,"" while in another she simply kills herself and is he sorry.

Reid's strongest LP to date isn't quite strong enough.

Sound is more than adequate considering, songs mostly good-to-great, overall effect a little unrealized for my taste.

Most of my informants prefer Meet the Residents or (especially) Third Reich n' Roll, with its disrespectful but familiar quotes from the likes of ""It's My Party"" and ""96 Tears,"" but I find this current album more listenable--Another Green World with a chip on its shoulder, sort of.

The futuristic, Mahavishnu-style jazz-rock gets hot enough at times to make you believe in spirit energy. But Corea's themes lack the grandeur of McLaughlin's, and what good is God without grandeur? Part of the problem is technical--when you articulate fast runs cleanly on an electric piano you sound precious almost automatically. Too often, though, I suspect that's what Corea wants. Better he should try for the cosmic joke--like when ""Captain Senor Mouse"" breaks into ""La Cucaracha.""

Greil Marcus argues that the former Wall of Voodoo frontman is ""playing with"" the American voice Raymond Chandler once described: ""flat, toneless and tiresome."" Pretty clever, only I don't hear much play. That voice is no creation--it's Ridgway, who shares with Chandler the literary sins of cynicism and literariness. Like a city reporter with a drinking problem or a novelist turned night clerk, Ridgway is a wise guy who isn't as wise as he thinks he is, and while a fair number of these songs have the sleaze-infatuated atmosphere L.A. artists from West to Waits have gone for, only a couple--""Walkin' Home Alone,"" a song of lost love any asshole would be proud of, and ""Pick It Up (And Put It in Your Pocket),"" the dirt on Reagonomics--belong in the same paragraph as Raymond Chandler.

This is a good bad record and you'll just have to forgive Smokey in advance. It turns out that he didn't split with the Miracles for domestic reasons--somewhere in his heart, he wanted to be Isaac Hayes--and yet somehow he's beyond all his own bullshit. Listen to ""Harmony,"" about the Miracles, or ""Just My Soul Responding,"" a landmark of post-psychedelic soul protest, or ""The Family Song,"" an astrology lyric that ought to be covered by Shirley Ellis, or Grace Slick.

FALSE,B,A Quiet Storm,Smokey Robinson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7649,"
Only ""Virgin Man,"" the most audacious and appropriate song he's written in years, kept Pure Smokey from drifting away. The title cut here announces Robinson's intention of distilling that drift into a style--rhythmically it seems to respond more to his internal state than to any merely physical criterion. Audacious in its way, and sexy, too, I guess, but he can't be my love man until he finds a beat. Which he does--not on the number-one soul hit ""Baby That's Backatcha,"" but as the record is drawing to a close, on ""Love Letters"" and the coy ""Coincidentally.""

FALSE,B,Yes It's You Lady,Smokey Robinson,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8294,"
He's lost purity on the high end, but the rich grain of his mature midrange more than compensates, and he's never sung with more care, intelligence, or yearning. Unfortunately, he hasn't settled for such ordinary material in years; his equation of love and ""irresistible merchandise,"" for instance, dishonors his penchant for the prepossessing polysyllable, and that's on the title cut. Does he almost get away with it anyway? Yes, he almost gets away with it anyway.
"
FALSE,B,One Heartbeat,Smokey Robinson,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8298,"
With executive producer Berry Gordy very hands-on, the man who named the quiet storm goes for his own--middle-aged platinum, just like Tina and Aretha and Dionne and Marvin, God rest his soul. After entrusting the lead single to outsiders who've made pop-funk their metier, he inputs some songwriting, with superpro results that carry the A. But only side two's ""Love Don't Give No Reason,"" one of those shocking domestic melodramas that have dotted his maturity, packs the slightest surprise. Moreover, I doubt he'll get his own. Being perpetually underrated ain't about talent--it's about glamour. As is middle-aged platinum.

FALSE,B,Never Gonna Let You Go,Vicki Sue Robinson,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4119,"
In the great tradition of Gloria Gaynor's Never Can Say Goodbye, you can not only dance to one whole side of this disco album but listen to it--and in the case of the emblematic ""Turn the Beat Around,"" bang the dashboard to it. In the same great tradition, side two is unmitigated crap. Next: Doreen Taylor's Never Get Off Your Back.
"
FALSE,B,Nurds,The Roches,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3829,"
They're trying too hard. The title cut's all moue and double-take, you can hear Suzzy upstaging her big sisters, and Maggie's side-closers are so intense and compressed it's impossible to know what they mean, though for sure a more experienced poet wouldn't put so much weight on her metaphors (chocolate versus soybeans somehow getting us to boat people living--and no doubt sufferin'--in Suffern, whew). Nor does Paul Simon henchman Roy Halee channel them the way Robert Fripp might have. Even so these songs have an almost magical esprit; Maggie's ""One Season"" will be in their act when they're fifty. Nobody in pop music equals their intelligence or delight. But I hope they calm down some.
"
FALSE,B,Get Yer Ya-Yas Out!,The Rolling Stones,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7655,"
Yeah, I was at the Garden when this was being recorded, and I had a great time. But despite Mick Taylor's guitar on ""Love in Vain"" and the spruced-up ""Live With Me,"" there's not a song here that isn't better somewhere else--including the two Chuck Berry covers and the one-act ""Midnight Rambler.""
"
FALSE,B,Goats Head Soup,The Rolling Stones,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3836,"
Except for the spavined ""Dancing With Mr. D,"" and the oxymoronic ""Can You Hear the Music,"" these are good songs. But the execution is slovenly. I don't mean sloppy, which can be exciting--I mean arrogant and enervated all at once. Mick's phrasing is always indolent, but usually it's calculated down to the last minibeat as well; here the words sometimes catch him yawning. Without trying to be ""tight"" the band usually grooves into a reckless, sweaty coherence; here they hope the licks will stand on their own. Only on ""Starfucker,"" the most outrageous Chuck Berry throwaway of the band's career, does this record really take off.
"
FALSE,B,It's Only Rock 'n' Roll,The Rolling Stones,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3837,"
This is measurably stronger than Goats Head Soup, and I hear enough new hooks and arresting bass runs and audacious jokes to stretch over three ordinary albums--or do I mean two? I also hear lazy rhymes and a song about dancing with Father Time and two sides that begin at a peak and wind down from there and an LP title that means more than it intends--or do I mean less?

FALSE,B,The Cutting Edge,Sonny Rollins,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11693,"
Rollins is one of those certified geniuses who didn't pan out for me when I had the time to investigate jazz, and although I hoped for belated paydirt from his first live album in years, more careful examination reveals that the straight melodies do get dull and the improvisations aren't rich enough to invite deep digging, just like all the jazz metallugists warned me.
"
FALSE,B,It's a Condition,Romeo Void,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8309,"
Those who find sex and love in the new bohemia a theme that hits home admire this for its literary value, but only one cut kicks it on back: the opener, ""Myself to Myself."" Until the likes of ""Charred Remains"" and ""Confrontation"" attain an equally hypnotic self-absorption, I'll relegate Debora Iyall's alienation tales to my sociology shelves.
"
FALSE,B,Silk Purse,Linda Ronstadt,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7662,"
This ought to be a good record. She's tough (and sexy) live, and she sure does pick good tunes--Mickey Newbury's new-Nashville ""Are My Thoughts With You?,"" which in Newbury's 45-rpm version has gotten a lot of play on my bedroom jukebox, says a lot about love and its dislocations, but so does Mel Tillis's old-Nashville ""Mental Revenge,"" which I'd never heard before. Country material over rock-flavored arrangements is the concept, and the honky vulgarity of Ronstadt's voice the reason. But only occasionally--""Lovesick Blues"" and ""Long Long Time"" are both brilliant--does she seem to find Kitty Wells's soul as well as her timbre.
"
FALSE,B,Prisoner in Disguise,Linda Ronstadt,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7666,"
I agree that this is a letdown after Heart Like a Wheel, but I wish someone could tell me why. Maybe the explanations are vague--she's repeating a formula, she's not putting out, etc.--because a singer like Ronstadt, who specializes in interpreting good songs rather than projecting a strong persona, must achieve an ineffable precision to succeed. But maybe it's simpler than that. People say her versions of ""Tracks of My Tears"" and ""Heat Wave"" are weak, but they're not--they simply don't match the too familiar originals. ""When Will I Be Loved?"" and ""You're No Good,"" on the other hand, were great songs half-remembered, kicking off each side of Heart Like a Wheel with a jolt to the memory. And this album could sure use a jolt of something.

FALSE,B,Living in the U.S.A.,Linda Ronstadt,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7671,"
This one divides right down the middle. The last four covers on the second side are so clumsy that I may never again hear the opener, Little Feat's ""All That You Dream."" But I do kind of like the first side, specifically including the forced intensity of the Chuck Berry and Doris Troy remakes. Only on ""Alison,"" though, does she enrich what she interprets.

FALSE,B,Surrender,Diana Ross,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7676,"
This time the hits Ashford &amp; Simpson have written for Diana were written for Diana, which minimizes embarrassing comparisons. And the verve of side two--where Motown finally learns how to kowtow to Broadway and keep the songwriting royalties--suggests that she's learning to hold her own.

FALSE,B,The Boss,Diana Ross,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7682,"
In which La Suprema passes a crash course at the Ashford &amp; Simpson School of Total Adult Fulfillment, although not with As. It's her house, she wants your good lovin' once in the morning and once in the evening, she'll compete and regret it, she'll cooperate and be glad, and she shall survive, because she's the boss. Quite smart, quite sexy, but sometimes dull--it doesn't do much for A&amp;S's crash material that there's only one singer.

FALSE,B,All the Great Hits,Diana Ross,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8312,"
First time through this double I said fine, perfect in fact--only aficionados will remember anything else. Even ascertained that the fifteen-minute Supremes medley, segued together from the originals rather than recorded live with her show band, wasn't offensive. But it is useless, and it's also true filler--imagine, her entire solo decade has been good for less than four sides of compilable material. This woman is nothing without a context, and beyond the obvious, Rodgers &amp; Edwards are the only one she was ever made for--Ashford &amp; Simpson's domesticity still sounds awkward on her after years of familiarity, and her movie themes are no better than Shirley Bassey's. The great exception is ""Love Hangover,"" produced in 1976 by true hack Hal Davis, who with that song and that track could probably have gotten a disco classic out of June Pointer, Sarah Dash, Cindy Birdsong--though not Shirley Bassey.

FALSE,B,Crazy From the Heat,David Lee Roth,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8315,"
Since I'm a person of broader culture than the average Van Halen fan, it didn't smash my preconceptions to hear him cover the Beach Boys and the Spoonful and Dan Hartman and ""Just a Gigolo""--just irritated me, reconfirming my instinctive belief that he chose metal over Vegas because Vegas wouldn't have him. Way back when, that is--it's clearly where he'll end up if his movie career should fall through. And as it turns out, his movie career has softened me up--the panoply of grotesquely stereotyped caricatures who populate his videos grosses me out a little, but its capacity to shock is tonic in this bland musical moment. This is an adequate soundtrack.

FALSE,B,For Your Pleasure,Roxy Music,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3024,"
These guys make no secret of having a strange idea of a good time, but this isn't decadent, it's ridiculous. Side one surrounds two pained, strained torch jobs with two classic neo-rockers and finishes with a song about an inflatable sex doll that's almost not stupid (title: ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache""). Side two surrounds a fast fast one with two long mostly instrumental slow ones that are almost not boring. Verdict: almost not not bad.
"
FALSE,B,Viva! Roxy Music,Roxy Music,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3028,"
This isn't bad, not for a live album issued in lieu of current studio product. Concentrating on relatively obscure material from the first two LPs, which always sounded a bit thin, it adds humor and some untrammeled Phil Manzanera to ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache."" But I prefer the studio ""Bogus Man"" and ""Chance Meeting,"" thin and all. And that is bad.

FALSE,B,Flesh and Blood,Roxy Music,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3030,"
Except maybe on ""My Only Love""--imagine a song of that title written for (no, rejected by) Perry Como--this never sinks to their Liebschmerz-drenched nadir. But the secondhand funk is getting too easy to take. Much as I enjoy the languorous ""Midnight Hour"" and above-it-all ""Eight Miles High,"" I always get suspicious when covers overwhelm originals.

When it comes to El Lay punk, you take the sun-addled Germs and Circle Jerks and Dickies and leave me these stagestruck outlanders, Doug Fieger production and all. At least they understand what being phony means. ""Young and Dumb"" doesn't replace From Akron's definitive ""Brain Job"" because it's not about the Rebs. But anybody who can link the hallowed anomie of (the Pistols') ""No Feelings"" to the cartoon cannibalism of (the Rebs') ""Child Eaters"" deserves to tour with the Psychedelic Furs.

The Mississippi-bred Ruffins are as close as Motown gets to Southern soul, so it's probably geography that makes their approach more Sam &amp; Dave than James &amp; Bobby Purify--all growling melismatics, with Jimmy's higher and much narrower timbre providing sweet relief from David's rough power. And for once in Motown's life there are a lot of good covers--from Ben E. King, Jerry Butler, even the Delfonics (even James Taylor).

With Chaka Khan pushed up front this looks like L.A.'s answer to Tower of Power--white funk players behind black singer. Chopswise neither the hornless five-piece band nor the horny three-octave voice is up to Oakland's pride, but I prefer the attitude, which is to admit your limitations and keep it simple. Maybe no one would have noticed if Stevie Wonder hadn't given them ""Tell Me Something Good."" But he did.

No doubt they think they're getting classy, but I think they're getting cute--compare the hip-skipping ""On Time"" to last year's booty-bumping ""Rufusized."" They're also starting to keep the composing royalties in the family. Exception, Bee Gees Go Home Division: Chaka's up-and-over ""Jive Talking.""

FALSE,B,Faithful,Todd Rundgren,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3969,"
As you probably know by now, one whole side recreates six '60s studio masterpieces note-for-note, from the calculated spontaneity of Bob Dylan to the electronic perfectionism of the Beach Boys and the Beatles. This is impressive and amusing, you can fool your friends, but it's overwhelmed (once you've heard it a few times) by what might be called the Enoch Light (or Your Hit Parade) (or voiceprint) effect. That is, Todd's vocal imitations (a phrase that deserves one of his slurs) sound thin and forced. This is especially notable considering how well his voice works on the other side, his clearest and most interesting set of songs since Something/Anything. It also reinforces the unfortunate impression that even when clearly interesting, Todd is factitious and compulsively secondhand.

FALSE,B,Runt,Runt,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3964,"
If there were any justice, ""We Got to Get You a Woman"" would melt Ti-Grace Atkinson's heart and ""I'm in the Clique"" would earn the artiste a free night at the Record Plant. But they're not playing the single on WBAI, and the artiste, ex-Nazz and present whiz Todd Rundgren, already knows his way around. Takes a certain professional brass to write a song called ""There Are No Words"" that goes ""Oh, Ah, OOOOO""--or to assume the persona of a newborn twin, especially for nine minutes.

If pop can be either sunny or moony, this is green cheese. And though it's less wildly uneven than its predecessor, that cuts two ways--the boyish ""Be Nice to Me"" and the mock-macho ""Parole,"" while quite nice, will never call me back to the ordinary stuff the way Runt's prize runts did.

FALSE,B,Leon Russell and the Shelter People,Leon Russell,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2043,"
Russell knows how to put music together, but he still has trouble putting it across. His Okie-cum-Brooklyn (ersatz Nworleans?) drawl is the outcry of a confused homeboy driven to fuse rootsy eccentricities with masscult shtick and flash, and his meaningfulness clarifies nothing. The Dylan covers here are trying to tell us something, but in the end Russell's newfound (and competent enough) zeitgeistery (""Stranger in a Strange Land"") and protest (""Alcatraz"") aren't as interesting as the injokey ""Ballad of Mad Dogs and Englishmen."" Which tells us something else.

If the first one was their acid album this 1969 session is their protest album, beginning and ending with advice to a ""straight brother"" and featuring a revised ""Sweet Home Chicago"" (for Mayor Daley and his ""northern rednecks""), a soppy antiwar song, a scabrous antiwar song, and a confusing anti-smoking song. As well as four love songs that will never make Merv Griffin, one because it advocates ""eating salty candy.""

FALSE,B,What I Did on My Vacation,Mitch Ryder,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7707,"
What he remembers best, apparently, is sex with men, and the songs that result put across all the sin, fear, passion, love-and-hate, pleasure, and release that buggery seems to have involved for him. The lyrics sometimes lack coherence, and the music is a more sensitive version of the now outdated r&amp;b-based guitar flash he favored with Detroit back in 1970. But the overall effect is revelatory.
"
FALSE,B,Diamond Life,Sade,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8329,"
Though there's not much range to her grainy voice or well-meaning songwriting, she and her associates put their project over, and with a fashion model's virtues--taste, concept, sound (cf. ""look""). There's no superfluity, no reveling in la luxe, not even an excessive tempo. Which is no doubt why I find myself crediting her humanitarian sentiments, even preferring her ""Why Can't We Live Together"" to Timmy Thomas's equally spare but naive original. And why those who find ""Hang On to Your Love"" and ""Smooth Operator"" seductive (instead of just warming, like me) will think they carry the whole album.

Even when it's this sumptuous, there's a problem with aural wallpaper--once you start paying attention to it, it's not wallpaper anymore, it's pictures on the wall. And while as a wallpaper these pictures may be something, they can't compete with the ones you've hung up special. That's why I prefer my aural wallpaper either so richly patterned you can't see past the whole (Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians) or so intricately worked you can gaze at the details forever (Eno's Another Green World). In between I'll take Julie London.

""Shake Your Thang"" is a stroke because as a duo they can come out for two opposing sexual prerogatives at once--one does, the other doesn't, and it's nobody's thang but hers either way. Nor does E.U. hurt their soul. Elsewhere, the confusion signalled by the ""See label for Sequencing"" is reflected in ordinary rhymes, scattershot beats, and a second Isleys cover, this one masquerading as a Beatles cover.

FALSE,B,Sanders' Truck Stop,Ed Sanders,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1130,"
This is literally a country-rock takeoff--not a parody but a departure. But though I hesitate to criticize a man who is not only a saint and a genius but who says hello to me at the post office, I must point out that the yodeling country twang Sanders developed with the Fugs has never known the difference between parody and departure, which makes some of these songs seem crueller than they're intended to be. Of course, sometimes they're cruel on purpose--like ""The Iliad,"" a saga of good old queer-bashing with a Greek-to-me intro. And sometimes, like ""Jimmy Joe, the Hippybilly Boy,"" they're--snurfle--lyrical and sad.

FALSE,B,Santana III,Santana,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7714,"
In theory, the polyrhythms intensified the momentum while the low-definition songwriting served the freeflow gestalt. In fact, the Latin lilt lightened the beat and the flow remained muddy indeed. So the electricity generated by the percussion-heavy opening cut comes as a pleasant surprise, and the movement of what follows is a surprising pleasure. New second guitarist Neal Schon deserves special thanks for crowding out Gregg Rolie's organ. Maybe soon he'll come up with more than one idea per solo.

Bill Graham and David Rubinson augment Sri Chinmoy's everybody's-everything strategy with direct-hit tactics as Carlos resumes his attack on the rock marketplace. Greg Walker doubles credibly as soul man and sonero, and ""Dance Sister Dance"" is the band's all-time hottest original even if it is lifted form a universal salsa riff. As Armando Peraza proves (on ""Gitano""), better salsa conservatism than samba impressionism. And as Carlos proves, better salsa than Wes Montgomery at his schlockiest or a tune called ""Europa"" that lives up to its name.

Like his great (also greater) exemplar, Leo has abandoned all pretensions mid-career (except on the title cut). And sure enough, Warners has now broken three big singles off this album, which makes 1977 the year of Leo Sayer the way 1976 was the year of Fleetwood Mac. Not quite as gratifying, is it? My pick for number four: ""I Think We Fell in Love Too Fast,"" a natural for the young divorcee crowd.

When Scaggs announces that his girl is a looker because ""she looks like she's standin' right there,"" you believe he's got a right to sing like Neil Young wishing he were Smokey Robinson.

In search of the perfect makeout music for ex-hippies, Scaggs ditched his band of bohos halfway through and hied to Muscle Shoals, where the laid-back lie down with the overproduced as a regular thing. It may just be my imagination, but except for ""Dinah Flo"" and ""Slowly in the Wind""--written by his bassist, David Brown, who's challenged Scaggs with cryptic lyrics on all of his Columbia albums--I think I like the boho stuff better.

The rhythms and harmonies are properly knotty, the ideology grounded, the prosy, dissociated lyrics never corny.

""It's Time to Kiss,"" with Patti LaBelle raring to go, probably wouldn't fit, but that doesn't go for such lesser tracks as ""Orbit"" and ""This Planet's a Mess,"" both of which could use a shot of Cindy &amp; Kate.

Maybe two of the three new cuts on this fattened major-label reissue are weak, but liberals will certainly be heartened by ""Housing the Joint""'s explicit denial of those ""racism"" rumors. Me, I don't give a shit one way or the other, because even though the subtlety would be lost on me if he held a .357 to my head or gang-banged my bitch in the back room, I'm certain that the secret fascination this professional B-boy holds for white critics isn't just his exotic brutality, which he certainly makes the most of--""motherfucker"" is such a rhythmic word. It's his intimations of vulnerability--not L.L. Cool J's romantic shit, but something wryer and stupider. What other rapper would write a rhyme about the night his mother pulled a gun on him--or make it so clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove. Docked a notch for gang-banging a bitch in the back room.

FALSE,B,Moving Target,Gil Scott-Heron,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8340,"
With Malcolm Cecil coproducing, Scott-Heron's music comes back strong--the horns and rhythm are progressive funk as it was meant to be, Tower of Power without Vegas, dissonant and intricate and talky and natural. But the Caribbean inflections are compromised enough to suit a lyric that sounds commissioned by the Jamaican Tourist Board if not Edward Seaga himself, and while this album has plenty of good parts, they come together only on the side-openers: two on side one, one on side two.
"
FALSE,B,Bridges,Gil Scott-Heron/Brian Jackson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7747,"
Quite rapidly, Scott-Heron has developed into a reliable pro, like some old country singer. The music and singing provide lasting service, and the words evolve with the times, which is the point. In a self-annointed aesthete, that would be tantamount to failure, but for a message artist it's high praise. As long as his eye stays fresh, I don't believe Scott-Heron can make a bad album, and his fans will like this one OK.

FALSE,B,The First Minute of a New Day,"Gil Scott-Heron, Brian Jackson and the Midnight Band",1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7745,"
The improvement in this poet-turned-musician suggests that white singer-songwriters could benefit from commitment to a musically sophisticated culture. He's got it, and he flaunts it. The singing will get stronger, and maybe someday every lyric will compare with the inspiring, despondent ""Winter in America."" In the meantime, the free-jazz-gone-populist band generates so much rhythmic energy that it carries over the weak spots. One heartfelt suggestion: no more long poetry reading, at least on record. I laughed at ""Pardon Our Analysis"" the first time, but now I find myself avoiding side one.
"
FALSE,B,"Plus, Also, Too--",Scrawl,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8341,"
As female-identified garage-rock, this never attempts to glorify its ineptitude with swagger or poetry--it has the guts to make plain that ineptitude isn't so damn far from vulnerability. Too often, right, it's merely inept--tuneless and quiet instead of tuneless and loud. But when S. Hershe worries that she's turning into ""a slut,"" or wonders if she should ""decide not to worry,"" or simply sings ""I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm so fucking sad,"" her brains could break your heart.
"
FALSE,B,Songs to Remember,Scritti Politti,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8342,"
With the force of religious conversion, abrasive anarchist Green Gartside emerges as a pop-funk sweety-pie. Though he'd sing like Al Green if could, he settles for a gentle conversational tenor but tries too hard. The lyrics always bespeak literacy and sometimes deliver wit (""I was like an industry/Depressed and in decline""), as does the music, which shores up the out-of-pocket rhythms with tunes rather less often it undercuts them with dissonance. He's still in the deconstruction business, after all. The one that goes ""My sincerity, my penicillin, my window, and my drudgery"" is called ""Jacques Derrida.""
"
FALSE,B,The Son Seals Blues Band,The Son Seals Blues Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7754,"
As the notes say, it's rare for a young bluesman to defy the commercial realities and try to develop his own writing and playing style. What they don't mention is that the writing has a ways to go. But I like the coarse flow of his ""scruffling"" guitar, especially in a distort mode--like the choked comping behind ""Your Love Is Like a Cancer,"" which neatly enough is the album's most striking lyric.
"
FALSE,B,Love's Melodies,The Searchers,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8344,"
I kept listening to this record at the behest of two dear friends--Tom Smucker, known Beach Boys fanatic, and Greil Marcus, all-purpose self-starter. Eventually I got it, too. It's bigger and glossier and rockinger than anything they managed as the second-best group in Liverpool, and not only that it's more tuneful. They even cover Big Star's ""September Gurls,"" which shows true power-pop hip. But for me it's a big, glossy, rocking, tuneful bore, because except on ""Radio Romance"" (""I love the radio/But the radio don't love me""), their only discernible motive is to take what they did well back in the '60s and do it even better, i.e., more professionally. Back in the '60s they had more motive than that.

The ten-minute ""Candy Licker"" isn't so much audacious as preposterous, which isn't going to stop collectors and others from craving their own cache of ""I want to lick you till you come."" Elsewhere Sease is an ingratiating soul man who's totally unconscious of how anachronistic he is, probably because he thinks licking women till they come is the essence of modernity.

Sebastian is as on for this solo debut as he ever was for the Lovin' Spoonful, and when he's on, the hummability quotient of his songs is dizzying--a good half of these imprint themselves upon impact. But just like Spoonful albums used to, this drags in the second half, and I feel vaguely let down. Maybe it's the gently paternalistic sexism of ""She's a Lady"" and ""What She Thinks About."" Or maybe it's his taste in T-shirts.

In 1966, Seely's ""Don't Touch Me"" took country women's sexuality from the honky-tonk into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards. But never again did she find a song at once so moral and so febrile.

Much sharper covers (his ""Midnight Rider"" beats Cocker's) plus originals that ain't bad for tours 'n' tribulations--""Rosalie,"" to CKLW programmer Rosalie Twombley, is a stroke in more ways than one, and the details of a day on the road in ""Turn the Page"" actually make you feel sorry for the poor guy. Elsewhere he feels sorry for himself, which is not the same thing.

The impassioned remakes from Beautiful Loser on side one are what live doubles are supposed to be for, and this one is sparing with the cheerleading and calisthenics. In short, it's good of its kind. But I'm from New York, I see a lot of rock concerts, and even when I'm in the room it takes more than ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man"" and ""Heavy Music"" and refurbished songs from a guy's last album to get me excited.

FALSE,B,Like a Rock,Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8349,"
The songwriting's sharper, but he's not. Whether their focus is personal (""Like a Rock""), social (""Miami""), or personal-as-social (""Tightrope""), all his evocations of this rock and that hard place add up to is high-grade soap opera. Between John Robinson's measured arena beat and Craig Frost's Bittanesque semiclassicisms, Seger comes on as a world-weary elder statesman, which is to say an incurable cornball. Transcending all this is ""The Ring,"" the tale of a good marriage that didn't get it all, and too bad Bruce won't cover it.

Selvidge's voice is so rich it's a curse, especially since it's combined with a good-humored grasp of blues tradition--all he has to do is release the notes and people tell him he's a genius. On this evidence, Selvidge is only a craftsman. His gifts as a lyricist are limited, and his guitar can't sustain a whole album. But the two lead cuts and Selvidge's own ""Frank's Tune"" overcome.

There's no denying the vivacity of Howard Hewett's reconstituted trio--the harmonies and rhythms pop out of the speakers with a brightness of definition that's good for a real lift. But if Hewett has any other interests, he doesn't make them plain--always look again when the standout track comes from contract songwriters. And if Hewett's new sidekicks have any other interests, their solo turns make me hope they keep them out of earshot.

On the ""studio side,"" where the marginal differentiations are nicely tricked up, Jimmy Pursey comes across as a thoughtful eccentric with his own ideas about punk dilemmas both musical and social. Turn the record over and he devolves into a passionate blur of the most faceless English punk sort. Anyone naive enough to structure a song around a repeated shout of ""George Davis Is Innocent"" can be charming for a while, but not for 11:31, which is how long it takes the ""live side"" to self-destruct.

FALSE,B,Let the Music Play,Shannon,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8359,"
Reports that this product makes it as an album are probably due to the addictive novelty of its rhythmic colors, in which one-man synth army Rob Kilgore surrounds a sweet, yearningly anonymous disco woman with a medium-b.p.m. carillon. But ""Give Me Tonight"" is a surprisingly essential follow-up, and the rest is crafted proportionately. Which is why some let the filler play too.

First line of the last one was ""When I grow up I want to be an old woman,"" first line of this one is ""God is a real estate developer."" Last time she stuck to received country/folk-rock, this time she essays horn arrangements that got lost in the mail. I appreciate the genderfucks (she's hetero here, homo there, and male when you mess with her sister) and could go for a few of the love songs (the long-suffering ""Silent Ways"" in its current incarnation, the long-suffering ""Sleep Keeps Me Awake"" and roving ""On the Greener Side"" gone to heaven). But on the whole this is too arch, too busy, too artistic, too political, succumbing to the overreach that always beckons when you have greatness thrust upon you.

FALSE,B,Boomerang,Shoes,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8362,"
These aging, insulated teen romantics haven't lost their skill at hook construction, but added studio muscle does nothing for their fragile allure. Striving to preserve their male-adolescent prerogatives--""Does he keep you amused between the covers?"" is hardly a teen question--they fail to conquer the distinction between girl trouble, a forgivable adolescent malady, and woman trouble, an offensive adult affliction. Maybe they should try out this Inspirational Verse in the first-person plural: ""She's losing her tested charms/Any little thing seems hard.""

Still hooky after all these years, the three principals divide up 15 more love songs: John Murphy makes up to break up, Jeff Murphy starts happy-happy and gets blown away, Gary Klebe obsesses and suffers and obsesses some more.

These snappy, hard-hitting songs are what rock and roll used to sound like back when singles were singles and boys would be boys. Except for ""Slip Away""--which I bet provides the melodramatic interlude live--every cut offers its little gift. But producer Lenny Kaye knows as well as anyone that in the halcyon days of top forty real largesse was required--melodies like ""Rendezvous,"" the only potential hit I hear here. Not that transforming ""Flight of the Bumble Bee"" into ""Tel-Star"" wasn't a fun idea.

The Gamble-Huff producer-songwriter, whose only major hit as a performer was a Shirley &amp; Lee revival, Phillifies himself honorably--in addition to two or three romps he sings soppy stuff like he wishes he were Smokey Robinson. Unfortunately, only ""Somebody Free"" comes close--closer than the romps do to Shirley &amp; Lee. Which leave the acappella-tinged ""Sweeter Than the Berry"" and the oddly arresting ""Love Train"" (a local) to put the album across.

Once there was a sensitive, conceited young fellow named Jonsi Birgisson who lived on a permafrost island surrounded by a cold, dark sea. Jonsi was a well-meaning person who loved music, and he yearned to put more warmth in the world even though he wasn't exactly sure what warmth was. Not just ""throwing an electric blanket on the corpse of electronica,"" that he knew. Jonsi longed to blaze ""inspired new avenues in sonic landscapes,"" to deliver ""shamelessly tear-stained epics"" in ""the falsetto cadence of angels,"" to turn ""4AD-styled, sepia-toned instrumental passages"" into ""awe-inspiring new-religious mantras."" Stuff like that. He did all this and more on a thematically linked work where some of the sonic landscapes were entrancing (although not warm). Because he was conceited, sometimes he would announce that these soundscapes were destined to change musical history, and then sometimes mean people would make fun of him. But he always had the perfect retort. ""You have to admit I'm smarter than Enya,"" he would say. And about that he was certainly right.

It's her devout hope that we'll ""savor each word like a raspberry,"" and I do mean devout--Sill yearns for the day when Christ the Bridegroom will ""take all the gentle away."" Thank god her music is spiritually unpresumptuous--pythagorean melodies and spare, delicate chamber-folk arrangements that set off her homespun drawl (the lyric sheet favors spellings like ""cuz"" and ""gunna""). Wish I could also say her lyrics were tart as raspberries, but they remind me more of peaches--fuzzy.

Strange--Simon leaves producer-mentor John Richbourg for Gamble-Huff and all of a sudden he's taking after Jerry Butler. Also strange, especially in an Ice Man, is the way his voice begins to melt when it ventures below the timbreline--how syrupy it gets at the end of ""Something You Can Do Today,"" for instance. Strange, but nice. Now if only Gamble-Huff would write more filler like ""O'le Night Owl"" to go with their two hits per album.

FALSE,B,Still Crazy After All These Years,Paul Simon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2691,"
I resented the patina of cheerfulness on There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973) because I thought it sold out the terse, evocative candor of Paul Simon (1972). Now I miss its intimations of universality. I hope in 1977 I'm not moved to praise unduly the small, self-involved ironies that define this record at its best (""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,"" ""You're Kind"") without alleviating its lugubriousness (""Night Game,"" ""Silent Eyes""). P.S. As you probably know, Art Garfunkel is back for one number. As you may not have noticed, Simon takes this as a cue to revert to the sophomoricism of ""Richard Cory"" and ""The Sound of Silence""--""a finger on the trigger of a gun"" indeed.

As vinyl, a gyp: $12.98-list double LP (albeit single CD or cassette) with just three more songs than CBS's superb and now out-of-print one-disc 1977 best-of, nine of which it includes, though not in such fetching order. The best Warners stuff is all from Graceland and wants to go home, and though the music is fine if you like such stuff, this is the kind of consumer manipulation that merits a boycott.

Where the two covers carried the debut, they drag the follow-up. But Mick Hucknall's originals are improving, and their guileless self-interest has its advantages--""I Won't Feel Bad,"" about his right to make pots of money because he's not the power elite, and ""Infidelity,"" about his right to fuck around because it's his right, are more convincing for their refusal to shilly-shally. They're also more convincing because Hucknall's an inherently convincing singer. All this is relative to the Anglopop norm, however. Better hot narcissism than cool narcissism, and better soul acolytes than Bowie clones. But not that much better.

The first side is just Sahm country and though I could do without the pedal steel I like it fine--""Cowboy Peyton Place"" and ""Texas Ranger Man"" are genre songs at their overstated best. The second side is redneck hoohah and I found it easier to take him seriously as a hippie, maybe because I'm more hippie than redneck myself--""Country Groove"" and ""Floatway"" and of course ""You Can't Hide a Redneck (Under That Hippy Hair)"" sound written to order, and if they did the hustle in Austin I'm sure he'd have added one of those (which might be more fun).

If this band were an established monolith in America the way it is in England, the love ballad and the music-hall sendup might sound nimble, but as it is they sound lame. Worse, only one of the clap-stompers--the defiant ""Do You Still Do It""--raises the roof.

FALSE,B,The Concept,Slave,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7806,"
While pioneering funk groups like Funkadelic and the Commodores, manned by veteran musicians, clearly evolved out of existing black-music formats, the younger ones often resemble third-generation rock groups in concept and spirit. Unless you prefer Kansas to the J.B.'s, this is not a compliment; profound thoughts like ""Now will always be forever"" might well grace the back of a Starcastle album. This is a Starcastle kind of band, too, right down to its general derivativeness and pretensions to content. But it doesn't make Starcastle music. Despite moderate tempos, the first side of the band's third and best LP chugs by smartly without once pausing to pose--it's fun, and it's interesting, too. Lesson: if the play of rhythms, textures, studio tricks, and vocal techniques constitutes the real content of your music, black is as beautiful as ever.

This really is Sly's best since Fresh, but the title does give it away, because Sly isn't going to progress by trying to recapture the past. Fresh was a great finale because it gathered five years of energy and innovation into an almost autumnal synthesis. There are cuts here--""The Same Thing,"" ""Shine It On""--that might fit into that synthesis. But there aren't any that could define it, much less suggest a new one.

FALSE,B,Ain't but the One Way,Sly & the Family Stone,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8390,"
I called Back on the Right Track his best since Fresh in 1979, and for what that's worth it was, and this may even be a little better--the aphoristic snap of the songwriting recalls better days, and the mix generates some heat. But where in 1979 it seemed theoretically possible that Sly was on some track or other, there's no way this'll pull him through--often sounds as if he's not even there. Which he wasn't when Stewart Levine finally converted the tracks he'd laid down in 1980 into 1983 product. What a waste.

Idealism in the young is always to be encouraged, which is why I can't resist a band so straightforward about its values: ""Not for the money/Not for the fame/We do it . . .""--for the love of rock and roll, right, Unca Bob? sorry, Tipper, not this time--"". . . TO GET LAID!"" So it grieves me to report that only rarely do Bart Lewis's glam-metal riffs live up to such Sally Cato lines as ""You play the fool and I play the tart"" or ""It's a filthy lie but someone's gotta live it."" Not even the cock-rock riposte ""Lick It into Shape"" is hard enough. Get down, guys, or your hot mama's gonna go bye-bye.

Having conquered my wimpophobia to where I reflexively enjoy the supple smarts of their sound, I bore down anticipating even tastier goodies, and now I must face facts. In three of these songs somebody's dead or dying, in three more somebody contemplates murder, and in the rest somebody's in a selfish pet of the sort that led to the aforementioned threats. So the liveliest tracks are where somebody's dead or dying: AIDS song, biz song, song about how selfish and petty you feel when somebody you've raged at actually dies.

Morrissey and Marr were nearing the end of the trail by the October '86 concert where this de facto retrospective was recorded.

Although the rumors of a major new artist that began after the success of ""Poetry Man""--still her sappiest song, although the lyrics here aren't what they call creative writing--originated with fuzzy-minded mongers, I'm pleased to report that her trademark melismatic quaver hasn't degenerated into a gimmick, and I acknowledge that this is a good record of its type. I just have my doubts about how good a jazz-folk mood-music record can be. Money isn't all that's ""worthless/When your music's mirthless""--sometimes the music is as well.

By now Snow projects a jazz singer's assurance, and though the originals are still overshadowed by the covers I'd like to hear Tammy Wynette try ""Majesty of Life,"" about ""what can happen to a girl in her hometown.""

Robert Wyatt's light touch imbues these pleasant experiments with their own unique pulse, but only because the music is labeled rock is it hailed as a breakthrough. It does qualify as a change of pace--on the group's last album three musicians put seventeen titles on two sides, while on this one eight musicians put four on four. But though Mike Ratledge's ""Out-Bloody-Rageous,"" to choose the most interesting example, brings together convincing approximations of Terry Riley-style modular pianistics and John Coltrane-style modal sax (Hugh Hopper has Jimmy Garrison's bass down perfect), Riley and Coltrane do it better. Only Wyatt's ""Moon in June"" is eccentric by the standards of its influences--which must be why it's hard to name them all.

Having dropped the trance-music distensions for theme-and-variation arrangements (long on the arrangement and short on the variation though they may be), does the band still call this ""rock""? It's English jazz, that's all--neither as flawed as you'd fear nor as muscular as its American counterparts. Non-composing saxophonist Elton Dean is the dominant voice, as saxophonists tend to be. He's adequate or better at free blowing, no mean accomplishment, but he's also a little thin in the embouchure, as English saxophonists tend to be.

The shortfall of this uprooted state-of-Mainer is generic. Like so many underground rappers, he's actually what his meaner and cheerier coequal Busdriver calls, less sarcastically than he thinks, a ""spoken-word artist."" He writes poetry designed for declamation. ""Never learned to dance because I exercise the right to write,"" so his beats are his rhymes and meters, and his scant music more atmosphere than rhythm. From a fringe foreseen by William Gibson, sharing cheap food and living quarters with fellow spirits he doesn't entirely trust if he can stand them at all, he speaks for a disenfranchised subculture that knows, as he says in his best line, ""jobs ain't nothing but free pens and long distance calls."" Certainly he understands things about this society that his better-adjusted contemporaries don't. But he's woefully short on not just empathy but humorous self-deprecation. With him, ""I only rap because I ain't smart enough to write a book"" is a species of boast. And when he does write a book, which he will, no one will read it.

They're sure to disagree--what else are they good for?--but despite all their apocalyptic integrity and unmediated whoziwhatsis, the achievement of their first halfway decent record is strictly formal: simple, rhythmic songs that neither disappear beneath nor get the better of the clanging and grinding of their brutal late-industrial guitars. Whatever credibility the guitars lend to their no doubt painful but nonetheless hackneyed manic depression is undermined by their usual sociopathic fantasies, and in the end the music isn't ugly or ominous or bombs bursting midair. It's just interesting.

Unless the meaning of life is passing me by, Bob Mould's proteges are the latest concept band, admired more for their correct aesthetics than for how they actually sound (or what they actually say). Fast turmoil rools, with hints of metal anthem and country warmth sunk deep enough in the mix that nobody'll cry corny. As a concept, pretty admirable.

FALSE,B,Soup,Soup,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7819,"
Now setting up distribution with movement movers like the White Panthers, this Appleton, Wisconsin group also sells its self-produced LP for three bucks from 4411 West Broadway, 54911. Comes in a plain brown jacket, with credits on a piece of lemon-colored paper stuck inside the shrink-wrap. The music isn't overtly political, just good, which ought to be what it comes down to: simple, plaintive, midtempo rock dominated by singer-composer-guitarist Doug Yankus. Actually, Yankus is a guitarist first--his playing dominates both the serviceable songs on one side and the blues-evolving-into-jazz jam on the other, and it sure beats Richie Furay or Carmine Appice. Makes you wonder just how efficient corporate capital is, doesn't it?

FALSE,B,I Don't Want to Go Home,Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11683,"
Except for some better than average original songs, this is white r&amp;b at its most pleasant, tasteful, and respectable--quite enjoyable, quite unextraordinary, and thank you honored guests.
"
FALSE,B,Introducing Sparks,Sparks,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7823,"
On its five albums for Bearsville and Island, this skillful brother act compounded personal hatefulness with a deliberately tense and uninviting take on pop-rock. But with their Columbia debut, Big Beat, they began to loosen up, and here one cut actually makes surf music history, in the tending-to-hyperconsciousness section. This is tuneful, funny, even open. But the fear of women and the stubborn, spoiled-teenager cynicism is still there, and it's still hateful.
"
FALSE,B,Youngest in Charge,Special Ed,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6186,"
With the 16-year-old rhyming quick as he can think over Howie Tee's tenacious samples, this starts off flying--nine ""ax""es in 13 seconds clim""ax"" ""I'm Taxin,'"" with sense no barrier. But thematically it's the usual, and as Howie downshifts and Ed pulls out his skeezer number (""I hate cheap sex,"" he warned us, neglecting to add ""after it's over"" and ""unless I'm selling it""), you wish he'd grow up, fresh or no fresh.
"
FALSE,B,More Specials,The Specials,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8417,"
This time they make the ska sound their own by synthesizing its trippy beat and their own inborn vocal attenuation into a single formal principle--a platonic ideal of fun. Especially on side two, the result is so light it's almost ethereal, political consciousness and all.
"
FALSE,B,New and Improved,Spinners,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7827,"
The slow side is Dionne Warwicke in flight plus filler. The fast side is Phillipe Wynne (sp?) in flight plus good filler (good 'cause he keeps flying). The prizes are ""Sadie,"" a mom song that should have broken pop, and ""Then Came You,"" a love song that did.
"
FALSE,B,"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow",Spinners,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7830,"
The first side would be their most featureless since they joined Thom Bell if it weren't for the asinine ""Me and My Music,"" which I regret to report is catchy enough for a single. But the second is their most listenable since Pick of the Litter. Philippe Wynn (oh, the hell with it) walks away with an eight-minute fast one on top of an eight-minute slow one, but it's a disco-flavored showpiece, produced by Thom's brother Tony and featuring ringer singer John Edwards, that gets things going. Purists fear the worst from Tony's groove, and they may be right, but ""Honey, I'm in Love With You"" ain't it. Edwards sounds a little like Al Green, which of course has nothing to do with my enthusiasm.
"
FALSE,B,The Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus,Spirit,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7834,"
Both Randy California and the band have their own cool, rich, jazzy style--a genuine achievement, but that doesn't mean you have to like it. They play better than they write, and since they still play songs, that's a problem. A worse problem is that the lyrics are rarely as cerebral as the music. ""Nature's Way,"" for instance, sounds as if it ought to be sardonicus, but though I'm intrigued by the suggestion that it's about death I still think it's a slightly inarticulate ecology song. Could be covered by Peter, Paul &amp; Mary--who also have their own style.
"
FALSE,B,Spot 1019,Spot 1019,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8424,"
Some Camper Van fans will suck up the only other band on their heroes' indie vanity label, but the true faithful won't believe. All together now, children, in your best Valley-boy-turned-surf-punk accents: ""They're just an imi-tay-shun."" Actually, without the (tongue-in-cheek) psychedelic utopianism and (closet) one-worlder rhythms, they're much more the college dropout humor magazine. Get off their share of snotty-to-spacy jokes, too.
"
FALSE,B,Cameo,Dusty Springfield,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7842,"
Offensive as I find the notion of a ""girl singer"" in this year of our enlightenment, something about this thirty-four-year-old woman demands the term, because her genius is to make me believe, down beneath my rational self, that she needs me. Simultaneously gushy and ladylike, she sings like the beautiful maidservant of men's vainest and most shameful fantasies--always the supplicant, always in love. Yet at the same time she manages to elicit sisterly sympathy from other women. Lambert and Potter have mixed the orchestra way too high on this record, but for these guys, who usually write banal melodies that stick so stubbornly you hate them for it, the tunes are complex and likable. Maybe that's because L&amp;P adjusted them for a tough human being who convinced them mid-session that she wasn't just some backup chick doing a solo spot. Recommended: ""Of All the Things,"" ""The Other Side of Life.""
"
FALSE,B,It Begins Again,Dusty Springfield,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7843,"
Roy Thomas Baker has encouraged Dusty's breathiness and then had the good manners not to suffocate it in the orchestral mix, and I'm grateful; I could listen to her sing tracking charts when she exhales that way. But the sad truth is that Baker has given her only a couple of strong ballads, the fluky treasures from Chi Coltrane and Barry Manilow that open each side, and so the fast numbers, never her forte, sound like filler. Next time, Baker should look beyond the pop pros for material like, say, ""Small Town Talk,"" ""Makin' Love Don't Always Make Love Grow,"" ""I Can't Stand the Rain."" And he should make sure there's a next time.
"
FALSE,B,We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions,Bruce Springsteen,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13306,"
We shall overkill, he means. Never have his Howard Keel tendencies, or maybe now they're Paul Robeson tendencies, tripped him up so bad. The idea is to big up the music and play the jokes you don't ignore like you're working a Roman amphitheater. I'm glad to have met the anti-war lament ""Mrs. McGrath"" and Sis Cunningham's ""My Oklahoma Home,"" and sort of hope young people deprived of music appreciation funding will now hear ""Erie Canal,"" ""Froggie Went A-Courtin',"" ""John Henry,"" and ""Jesse James."" Only are young people really ignorant of these songs? And how many of them buy Springsteen albums anyway? Amping up his strange bluegrass-Dixieland hybrid like E Street is just around the corner, he sings his lungs out. But in folk music, lightness is all--and only newbies and John Hammond Jr. lean so hard on the cornpone drawl.
"
FALSE,B,Cool for Cats,Squeeze,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7847,"
Power poppers (remember them?) suck this stuff up, and I understand why--not only does its songcraft surpass that of the band's debut, but it also isn't quite as sophomoric. It's sophomoric enough, though, and like so many such records makes you wonder where the power is. Not in the vision, that's for sure. And not in the beat. Great song: ""Up the Junction.""
"
FALSE,B,It's Alright,Chris Stamey,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8429,"
After two excessively eccentric solo LPs, Stamey's new wave supersession is excessively conventional, subsuming his mad pop perfectionism and repressed inner turmoil in mere well-madeness. Under the leader's iron thumb, Fier, Lloyd, Easter, Worrell, and the pack push all the right buttons, even the one marked Liftoff, thus transporting those who've been waiting five years for their hero to take them for a ride.
"
FALSE,B,The Finer Things in Life,Chuck Stanley,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8430,"
The tender heart palpitating beneath Public Enemy's hard-boiled exterior, Stanley is out of Oran Jones's league. His juicy baritone rises easily to a rich falsetto, and Luther or Freddie would pay cold money for either. But the range of his instrument becomes an end in itself--he never projects Luther's personal intensity or even Freddie's personal style. And while he's not yet a big enough love man to bore the world by controlling his own publishing, the soft fantasies of the hard-boiled do have their runny tendencies.
"
FALSE,B,Time Waits for No One,Mavis Staples,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6209,"
This dream meeting between the criminally underexploited black singer and the black-pop capo doesn't flop altogether--both principals can generate a certain minimum interest sleepwalking. The two songs composed by old Stax hands are slightly embarrassing, but they sound like Mavis, who's made meaningful schlock her lifework. The six by Prince sound like a top-of-the-line disco producer who can't say no to a great voice or a deep ballad.
"
FALSE,B,The Staple Swingers,Staple Singers,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7851,"
Don't be put off by the title. The Staples haven't been a gospel group for years, and now that they're admitting it they can build a credible pop-soul sound on their two extraordinary assets--Mavis's urgent voice and Pop's laggard lick. This has its clumsy moments, but it also has its transcendent one: ""Heavy Makes You Happy,"" a hit single from the same pen that gave us ""Sugar Sugar."" And Smokey Robinson provides moral suasion.
"
FALSE,B,Be What You Are,Staple Singers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7853,"
This is a pleasing, consistent album--no gaffes. But no gifts either, unless you count Bettye Crutcher's apparently literal ""Drown Yourself,"" which provides relief from a charity that's all too unremitting. In truth, the music sometimes seems a little unremitting too--bet I'd like both hit songs just as much if they didn't clock in at 5:01 and 4:27 on LP.
"
FALSE,B,Unlock Your Mind,Staple Singers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7857,"
For producer Jerry Wexler, this was obviously a labor of love. For the Staples likewise. Respects itself, you might say. But whether the problem is the songs or the way Mavis relates to them, only one cut, ""Handwriting on the Wall,"" would stand tall on their Stax best-of.
"
FALSE,B,Turning Point,Staple Singers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8431,"
This is indeed a spiritual return to their commercial heyday on Stax a decade-plus ago, which for those who don't remember was sometimes clumsily (sometimes even comically) uneven in tone and achievement. ""That's What Friends Are For"" is a sermon that'll keep you awake, but ""Bridges Instead of Walls"" would tempt the marginally pious to play pocket pool or peruse the weekly bulletin. And Mavis is more convincing as David Byrne than as Millie Jackson.
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Edwin Starr,Edwin Starr,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8433,"
He's more exciting at his best--check out the five tracks on Volume 3 of the Motown's Preferred Stock series, if you can find it and don't wear a pacemaker--but one reason he suits the disco format better than, for instance, Johnnie Taylor, is that he isn't as good as Johnnie Taylor. That is, his excitement inheres mostly in his formula. Just as you expected, the formula here isn't up to full-speed Motown like ""Agent Double-O Soul,"" ""War,"" or (the here reprised) ""25 Miles,"" though ""Accident"" comes close. Not only that--to salve his conscience they let him have some full-length ballads.
"
FALSE,B,Beaucoups of Blues,Ringo Starr,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7862,"
Finally he gets to impersonate Buck Owens for an entire record. I admit that over the distance he doesn't merely sing flat--sometimes the voice threatens to fade away altogether. But both the songs and Pete Drake's production bespeak a high-quality obsession--the music sticks. And Ringo is still Ringo, which means he's good at making himself felt.
"
FALSE,B,Stealers Wheel,Stealers Wheel,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7870,"
Skeptics said: ""Producers' group."" I disagreed, because Leiber &amp; Stoller have done nothing but sit on their genius for almost a decade, and because half of this duo had a promising pre-history as half of the eccentric English-folk-rockish Humblebums. Anyway, almost every song on the album sounded substantial--until I really listened, whereupon most of them sounded, well, let's say thoughtful. Conclusion: at the very least, the kind of group producers like.
"
FALSE,B,Handsworth Revolution,Steel Pulse,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3305,"
A promising debut from the first (black) English reggae group, and I bet there'll be others. The ideology is Rastafarian, but its mood is less steamy--as cool-headed as herb permits, and righteously angry. Now let's hope the music, which is distinctive but not all the way there yet, catches up with the words.
"
FALSE,B,True Democracy,Steel Pulse,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8436,"
One reason I've liked them is that they've always steered clear of Rasta misogyny, but not now--would they call out a man who ""says carnal love is a must""? Other reasons have included groove, politics, and hooks--groove alone won't do. Best politics: ""A Who's Responsible?"" and ""Worth His Weight in Gold."" Best hooks: ""A Who's Responsible?"" and ""Worth His Weight in Gold.""
"
FALSE,B,The Royal Scam,Steely Dan,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3314,"
The first question is whether the melodic retreat represents a refusal to indulge the audience or a withering of invention. The second is whether the conscious choice of a jagged, pinched music is a wise one. As if in compensation, the lyrics are less involuted and personal, but in fact their objectivity intensifies Steely Dan's natural nastiness. Whether this narrowing of spiritual possibilities is willed or a symptom of the same chronic insularity that makes Fagen and Becker unwilling to tour, the result sounds a trifle arty and a trifle producty at the same time. Does it matter whether they call San Juan ""the city of St. John"" in reference to the apocalypse or because it scans nice?
"
FALSE,B,Dots and Loops,Stereolab,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3323,"
From folkie soprano to synthesizer tweedle, many young people are down with their validation of high and clean--""Let There Be Flutes,"" as Bentley Rhythm Ace put it. And on a pretty good track, too, just like Emperor Tomato Ketchup is a fine album. Where us down and dirty types say sayonara is after the high artist peaks. Exploring rather than apotheosizing personal secrets, the high artist is like any other formalist, especially since he, she, or they probably suffered from formalist tendencies to begin with. On this album the tunes fall off and the wacky smarts lose the charm of surprise. There's still plenty of agile bass and clever sonic garbage. But only the high and clean will notice.
"
FALSE,B,Steppin' Out,Gary Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1347,"
""Well-produced"" for sure, more country and more rock and roll all at the same time. But it sounds as if the craziness has been rationalized right out of him.
"
FALSE,B,Little Junior,Gary Stewart,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7885,"
This is a likable album because Stewart is a likable artist, secure by now in his good-humored bad-old-boy persona. But only once--on a version of Ry Cooder's ""I Got Mine"" that ranks with the greatest Jerry Reed novelties--does he give that persona a shot in the arm.
"
FALSE,B,Brand New,Gary Stewart,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1350,"
Hard living deepens great voices, but it's hell on the smaller ones, and so naturally Stewart compensates by oversinging, burying the songs in a mannered misery and wild-ass desperation that for all you can tell he may actually be feeling. Wordplay's half there at best: ""I was born the life of the party/And honey I'm dyin' tryin' to get one started,"" which is terrific, is preceded by ""I was born the son of a honky tonk woman/My daddy was a natural-born gamblin' man,"" which is terrible. And which provides the song's title.
"
FALSE,B,A Night on the Town,Rod Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7892,"
This is Stewart's most ambitious record since Never a Dull Moment four years ago, but its ambitions are only partly fulfilled. If he's gonna start doing big message numbers, he'd better rise above the pathetic liberalism of ""Tradewinds,"" the most overblown song he's ever recorded 'cept maybe for the symphonic version of ""Pinball Wizard."" And if he's gonna break new ground thematically, as on the ""gay"" ""Killing of Georgie,"" he'd better come up with slightly less Dylanesque melodies--in the course of comparing Stewart's song with its fraternal twin, ""Simple Twist of Fate,"" I was reminded of just how precise an arrangement can be.
"
FALSE,B,Blondes Have More Fun,Rod Stewart,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7895,"
He used to mean to be meaningful and now he means to be trashy, but that doesn't make him decadent. Decadent is when Carol Bayer Sager writes all your songs for you.
"
FALSE,B,Tonight I'm Yours,Rod Stewart,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8444,"
This is not only a comeback but a speedup--comes on like he thinks Depeche Mode is the next Vanilla Fudge. These days the ""Mandolin Wind"" man only sounds genuinely sensitive when his ego's threatened--on the cuckolded ""How Long,"" not the icky-inspirational ""Never Give Up on a Dream."" And he's most convincing when he sounds really mad, on the cuckolded ""Jealous.""
"
FALSE,B,Long May You Run,The Stills Young Band,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2518,"
Like the tour, the album (recorded in Miami, where many of the songs take place) is a profit-taking throwaway, but that's not necessarily a bad thing--Young is always wise to wing it, and the less Stills expresses himself the better. Also, there's an expotential advantage in hearing Steve sing lead only every other cut. His ""Make Love to You"" (""you're such a lady"") does inspire ""Midnight on the Bay,"" Neil's stupidest song in many a moon. But most of the time Neil's in a droll mood--title song's a riot. Not bad for California rock.
"
FALSE,B,. . . Nothing Like the Sun,Sting,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8447,"
He's more relaxed this time, because he's gotten to know his band or maybe just because he's got to less to prove, but except on the lovingly funky ""We'll Be Together,"" no doubt a sop to the market, you're not going to catch him having fun. That would entail his getting out of himself, and from the jazzy insouciance of his Noah sendup to the aching compassion of his tribute to the mothers of the Chilean slain, the focus is always on the man singing. Pretentious, this is called, and no matter how humane your intentions it buries your subject matter in ego.
"
FALSE,B,Stories,Stories,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7907,"
The Left Banke, Mike Brown's long-ago previous group, seem a little prissy in retrospect, but they were sweet at the time, no? Well, this may seem prissy some day, too, but it'll never seem sweet--too intense. And if the other songs had the melodic sinew of ""St. James"" and ""Step Back"" it might seem quite strong now.
"
FALSE,B,Fantasy Rag,Stormin' Norman & Suzy,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7909,"
This might just be another good-time band dedicated to the proposition that scuzz is cute if it weren't for Suzy Williams's natural echo, which calls up images of riverboats and cathouse pianos despite the thin recording. Unfortunately, Norman Zamcheck's voice calls up images of an account executive fulfilling his inner nature, and while his songs really are fantasy rags--""Wealthy Philanthropist,"" for example, is a piquant piece of '20s camp--he captures Suzy perfectly only twice. The titles suggest her emotional range: ""Rise, Angel"" and ""Crazy Lady.""
"
FALSE,B,Ocean of Love,Stormin' Norman & Suzy,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7910,"
If anything, this intelligent major-label debut is a half-step down. There are no disabling gaffes, and in theory it's good for Suzy to sing more and Norman less; her big, sad, cheerful voice sounds more like itself, too. But despite the ocean noises and ""The Gallant Balloonist"" and a coda that goes ""socked right in the kisser--right in the eye,"" this is definitely an attempt at de-zanification. And what the world needs from Suzy Williams is not another chick--oops, woman, forgot about ""You Keep Me Cryin'""--singer. It's Suzy.
"
FALSE,B,"Greatest Hits, Volume Two",George Strait,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1388,"
The lackluster professionalism seems like the fulfillment of his always modest gifts and ambitions, with Something Special a blip. Not counting ""The Chair,"" which is on both records, there are five songs on that album that top anything besides ""All My Ex's Live in Texas"" on this one. ""You're Something Special to Me,"" which is also on both records, isn't among them. Instead it exemplifies the factory-certified hookiness of his current singles strategy, though its plain sentimentality is a little extreme--better the mild overstatement of ""Ocean Front Property"" or even the mild whoop-de-do of ""The Fireman."" No tuneouts, that's the ticket. Just blandouts.
"
FALSE,B,Surprise,Syd Straw,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5964,"
Fitting roots tastes to theatrical background, she connects song by song, eventually--lost dB's hit, riddle-me-rhyme, futurist nostalgia. But nowadays the smoothest singer-songwriter effort sounds mannered, and smooth this ain't: recorded in NYC, Woodstock, London, L.A., Austin, San Marcos, and Brian Eno's house with 37 musicians (no horns, no strings, 13 fairly famous guitarists), the album creaks with intelligence. Don't judge her by her claque. But don't believe her claque either.
"
FALSE,B,Mel Street's Greatest Hits,Mel Street,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7913,"
Street is sincere and rather modest; he keeps the music basic and never tries to overpower anyone with his personable baritone or unexaggerated drawl. But he sure does have a weakness for illicit love, and he ought to face up--referring to the objects of one's lust (a term he specifically disavows) as angels (in three out of ten song titles) will not fool the Lord.
"
FALSE,B,Red Card,Streetwalkers,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7915,"
In a time of hard rock drought, this will do--the tempos are up, and such songs as ""Run for Cover"" and ""Roll Up, Roll Up"" and ""Decadence Code"" suggest that they're observing our famous wasteland as well as experiencing it. Ominoso with a vengeance.
"
FALSE,B,String Driven Thing,String Driven Thing,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3364,"
This English quartet features a violinist, but stay where you are--no resemblance to Ian Anderson or David LaFlamme. Well, maybe a little--I could do without the mytholyric ""Jack Diamond"" and find the beat stiff at times. Still, they have one, not bad for a group driven by an electric bass and such ordinary peripheral percussion devices as congas and tambourines. In fact, they get pretty wild, with the violin exploited for dementia. Yet the lyrics are sane an dwell-observed. In my favorite, God doesn't play in a rock and roll band.
"
FALSE,B,Introducing the Style Council,The Style Council,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8454,"
A rather lengthy ""mini-LP"" continues the strange and touching saga of Paul Weller, who gave up the Jam because fronting Britain's best-loved band had turned into a superstar routine. Here he records relaxed lounge-soul tunes with a keyb-playing partner and as with the Jam's rock tunes it's unclear to a mere Yank what the big deal is. Weller's unabashed working-class leftism is a treasure, and his charm is undeniable at any distance. But there has to be undeniable music in here somewhere as well. Doesn't there?
"
FALSE,B,The Singular Adventures of the Style Council,The Style Council,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8456,"
Because I thought it was my problem that I'd never listened hard after Internationalists, I put heavy time into these hits, if that's what they really were. And slowly it began to dawn on me that maybe Paul Weller's motives for disbanding the Jam weren't all that pure--that he knew damn well pop smoothies were taking over from guitar bands. Tuneful, sometimes memorable, and often far from stupid, this Eurowise white funk comes from the same place musically as Culture Club and George Michael. Only it's not quite as good.
"
FALSE,B,8th Wonder,Sugarhill Gang,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8458,"
Although the Gang harmonize professionally enough to make you wonder what their gig was before they discovered talking, professional is as good as they get, and in the absence of vaguely interesting words the singing tracks are funktional dance music at best. The rap words aren't any more meaningful (this group never had better material than on its first, worst, and biggest single), but their rhythmic significance makes that irrelevant. You've heard of talking drums? Rappers are walking talking drums.
"
FALSE,B,A Love Trilogy,Donna Summer,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7928,"
This is marred by new what's-going-on-in-the-next-apartment distractions; again and again. Donna bids the object of her affections ""come . . . come . . . come"" before adding ""to my arms,"" so that when she cries out ""don't let go"" you have to wonder of what. But it does boast two otherwise uninterrupted sides of baroque German disco fluff and proves that she can carry a tune as well as a torch. I can even imagine playing it at a party.
"
FALSE,B,Cats Without Claws,Donna Summer,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1071,"
The mildly compelling steady-hooks-all-in-a-row construction suggests that Michael Omartian knows his Ric Ocasek, and it will do just fine for those who get a glow just hearing her rare back and sing. But what made the last album was two undeniably singular singles. This time she leads with a cover. Which Ben E. King rared back and sang better a quarter-century ago.
"
FALSE,B,Swampwater,Swampwater,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7940,"
On their own Linda Ronstadt's backup boys prove honest country-rockers, which is like (and probably is) honest folkies with more chops. Very tuneful in a variety of styles, with Gib Guilbeau's fiddle pushing toward the bayous and John Beland's guitar pulling 'em back to L.A. But their best lyric is about a dancing bear, and their version of ""Headed for the country"" is less bathetic than Johnny Darrell's only because they couldn't project big emotions if they wanted to.
"
FALSE,B,Make It Last Forever,Keith Sweat,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8462,"
For credentials the next big love man proffers beats on the slow ones and lyrics whose seduction strategy is never to offend. The lyrics don't define either, which is no surprise, just the usual disappointment; the beats prove Teddy Riley New York's answer to Jam &amp; Lewis. So the fast ones are fine. They're also outnumbered.

Let's Get It On without production values. Call it underdeveloped if you want; I'll mention that it's unaffected. Including the best peace lyric heard lately, entitled ""Had Any Lately?""

FALSE,B,Music World,Jamaaladeen Tacuma,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8470,"
First side's my kind of new age, a kitschy travelogue laid down with local fusioneers in Tokyo, Paris, Istanbul. Second side journeys from New York to Philadelphia, and let me tell you--both ""The Creator Has a Master Plan"" and ""One More Night"" have sounded more at home elsewhere.

FALSE,B,True Stories,Talking Heads,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3407,"
These songs were conceived for a movie, rarely an efficient way to initiate an aural experience. Yet they're real songs, not detached avant-garde atmospherics, and honest though David Byrne's sympathy may (I said may) be, they leach their vitality from traditions that demand more heart than he ordinarily coughs up. Interesting they remain. But no way the rhetorical gris-gris of ""Papa Legba"" or the evangelical paranoia of ""Puzzlin' Evidence"" or (God knows) the escapist solace of ""Dream Operator"" is gonna fascinate like ""Crosseyed and Painless"" or ""Slippery People""--for one thing, Byrne lets us know what the new songs mean, which ain't much. Do they rock, you want to know? Oh yes they do.

FALSE,B,Howard Tate's Reaction,Howard Tate,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7958,"
Born in Macon and resident in Philadelphia, Tate is a truly underground soul singer whose few small late-'60s hits (collected on one superb Verve LP) have earned him a rep among cognoscenti as diverse as Mike Bloomfield and Mark Farner. This album, produced by underground schlock-soul singers Lloyd Price and Johnny Nash in Jamaica, is based on even smaller hits. One of them, ""These Are the Things That Make Me Know You're Gone"" (""refrigerator left ajar,"" like that), dishonors his rep. But ""My Soul's Got a Hole in It"" doesn't, and Tate's voice is potent enough to activate more inert material. Cognoscenti will dig.
"
FALSE,B,Silent Tongues,Cecil Taylor,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11276,"
Since I recommend Taylor's appearances so extravagantly, it's only fair to note that there is a natural theater to his live performance that I miss on record--observing his concentration greatly increases my own. Especially solo, he's too abstract for a rock and roller to follow, although I love his Monkish early group sessions, recently reissued on a Blue Note twofer called In Transition. Even more than usual, take my grade as a measure of personal usefulness rather than aesthetic merit.
"
FALSE,B,JT,James Taylor,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7968,"
James sounds both awake--worth a headline in itself--and in touch; maybe CBS gave him a clock radio for opening an account there. ""Handy Man"" is a transcendent sex ballad, while ""I Was Only Telling a Lie"" and ""Secret o' Life"" evoke comparison with betters on the order of the Stones and Randy Newman, so that the wimpy stuff--which still predominates--sounds merely laid-back in contrast. Best since Sweet Baby James, shit--some of this is so wry and lively and committed his real fans may find it obtrusive.
"
FALSE,B,Rare Stamps,Johnnie Taylor,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11541,"
I'm not normally a big Taylor fan, but this is a semi-greatest hits record that eliminates a lot of dross.
"
FALSE,B,Super Taylor,Johnnie Taylor,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7972,"
Last time the best cuts took a while despite their hit history, which means you never got to the others without working at it. Here ""It's September"" (a you're-due-home lyric finished off with a sharp question mark of a guitar riff) and ""I've Been Born Again"" (testifying so ebulliently for fidelity that it sounds like both fun and the truth) have seduced me into listening to both sides again and again. And you know, they're pretty good.
"
FALSE,B,Basic Soul,Koko Taylor,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7976,"
Apparently, what basic soul means to Willie Dixon is basic blues--the music is in the traditional Chicago style, as it should be. But the songs have lost additional wang dang doodle--the standout is ""Violent Love,"" in which Willie and Koko try their hand at camp and don't get bitten.
"
FALSE,B,Kilimanjaro,The Teardrop Explodes,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8476,"
If Bunnyman Ian McCulloch favors the schlock mysterioso Jim Morrison, Droplet Julian Cope prefers the schlock heartthrob, complete with romantic authoritarianism (""Well I don't think this is real/To criticize our love"" is prime hippie bullshit, no?), ""Touch Me"" horns, and AM potential. No, really, ""Sleeping Gas"" was once a very poppy indie single, and some of this stuff would probably sound pretty neat on the, er, radio is what we used to call it I guess. But why anyone who didn't acquire an addiction that way would prefer this to Blondie or the Box Tops is beyond me. I mean, Cope is a little smarter than Jay Black or Gary Lewis, but that just makes him harder to take.
"
FALSE,B,Songs from the Big Chair,Tears for Fears,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8477,"
Never one to pay much mind to the plaints of English lads with synthesizers, I got duly annoyed at the surface and let it go at that. Imagine my surprise when I discerned substance underneath--uncommon command of guitar and piano, Baker Street sax, synthesizers more jagged than is deemed mete by the arbiters of dance-pop accessibility. Even found a lyric that went ""We are paid by those who live by our mistakes,"" not bad at all. Yet in the end the surface is still annoying--not so much pretentious as portentous, promising a depth and drama English lads have been falling short on since the dawn of progressive rock.
"
FALSE,B,Looney Tunes,Telex,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6061,"
These disco-mad Belgian technopoppers take off like a computer run amuck. By the time they're through with the lovable ""I Don't Like Music"" and the ducky ""Temporary Chicken,"" they could be the Art of Noise doing a comedy album, or Tom Tom Club on a roll--they've earned the right to call one ""Spike Jones."" But despite the ""Frere Jacques"" and ""Jingle Bells"" rips to follow, ""Spike Jones"" is as crazy as side one gets. And despite ""I Want Your Brain,"" side two is technodisco.
"
FALSE,B,Jack Tempchin,Jack Tempchin,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7980,"
In which the successful L.A. songwriter and former (putative) Funky King becomes a Schmeagle for our time--in the course of four terrific songs he loses his keys, misplaces his car, doesn't get laid, and spends fifteen days under the hood. That's the trick, Jack--tell enough jokes on yourself and your self-pity becomes tolerable.
"
FALSE,B,Psychedelic Shack,The Temptations,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7981,"
It's no accident that the best cut here begins ""Ain't no words to this song."" For all the hyperactivity of his horn charts, Norman Whitfield is a lot better equipped to get funky than to lead Motown's belated raid on ""relevance,"" and many of these lyrics are dreadful. Several of them are quite all right, though, and ""War"" does help mitigate the climactic wishy-wash of ""Friendship Train."" More to the point, the singing and playing really do fuse the production styles of Smokey and Sly, a major achievement. Why do white people challenge these songs so much quicker than they did ""Lucy in the Sky"" or ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun""? Are friendship trains any dumber than bed-ins?
"
FALSE,B,Sky's the Limit,The Temptations,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7983,"
Greater even than ""Just My Imagination"" is ""Smiling Faces Sometimes,"" in which for twelve minutes Norman Whitfield's spacey string and sound effects combine with a rhythm track that might as well be looped to transform Eddie Kendricks's soft lead into the rap of a paranoid soothsayer. But on the flip Whitfield funks up James Bond horns for nine horrible minutes and finds a Swahili title for an offensively defensive brotherhood appeal.
"
FALSE,B,Sheet Music,10cc,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2,"
Points for studio mastery and general literacy--""Oh Effendi,"" about the vicissitudes of Middle Eastern trade, is Cole Porter-ishly clever--but demerits for a detachment that might seem pathological if it weren't so damned expert. Great satire communicates a feeling--most often hatred or anguish, although it can be kinder, as in ""The Dean and I"" on 10cc--that is lacking from this too-too apollonian (cerebral? professional? glib?) endeavor. Though if the feeling itself is absent, a good beat will sometimes suffice in its stead.
"
FALSE,B,Construction No. 1,Ten Wheel Drive,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11055,"
I don't much approve of jazz-rock, and Genya Raven, this group's resident Janis Joplin, can get a little too harsh and samey at times, but this is so superior to anything (arghh) Lighthouse or (polite belch) Blood, Sweat, and Tears have done that I feel obliged to kind-of recommend it. I wish I believed their live performance shows as much taste, but I'm not making any bets.
"
FALSE,B,Sssh,Ten Years After,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10890,"
I should like this record, by a group I have always admired, more than I do. It has a lot of nice original fake blues songs and Alvin Lee's usual distinction on vocals and guitar. But in fact I never listen to it.
"
FALSE,B,Rock & Roll Music to the World,Ten Years After,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7995,"
I remember when this was a promising group--that Alvin Lee, he sure could sing and play, and those other guys sure did get it together behind him. But in four years and then some, all they've accomplished is to get it together some more. As unslick as ever, they're nevertheless a lot tighter in the commercial sense, and the speed and brevity of such cuts as ""Choo Choo Mama"" exemplify Alvin Lee's rockabilly approach to blues. On his own terms, this is mature, impressive work. But I suspect that the next time I feel like hearing TYA--in eight months or so--I'll put on Undead. It's pretty crude, but you know about old time's sake.
"
FALSE,B,The Classic Performances of Ten Years After,Ten Years After,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7996,"
OK, so the classic performances are on Deram. Neoclassic, then. I still find that their late phase has its kinetic (as we used to say) charms. And admit that even without the regrettable ""Positive Vibrations"" I'd be very unlikely to play this except for historical reference.
"
FALSE,B,End of the Millennium Psychosis Blues,That Petrol Emotion,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6157,"
So what happened to these guys? I know, they depunkified, but just because they seem to think funk has something to do with Tower of Power is no reason to take them off the guest list. Read the lyric sheet--if anything, they've grown in wisdom. Although if you didn't read the lyric sheet you'd never notice. That's what happened.
"
FALSE,B,The Sound of the Sand and Other Songs of the Pedestrian,David Thomas and the Pedestrians,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8487,"
It's not as if the last two Ubu albums didn't hint at such a consummation, but it's still a shock to hear Thomas dive like a fat swan into the art-rock he's accused of by prole ideologues. Smarter and funnier--more talented--than all but a few of the (mostly English) eccentrics who write oddly textured pancultural songs with drums but no beat about birds, shoes, hairpins, and other ""simple things,"" he ain't winging it. But he is more eccentric than one might hope. Interesting Note (to ""The New Atom Mine""): ""This song does not toast The Physicist as an individual or a class. Rather, it's an expression of appreciation for the publishing of exciting information.""
"
FALSE,B,Variations on a Theme,David Thomas and the Pedestrians,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8488,"
David Thomas leader-member was willing to have his ideas fucked with; David Thomas solo isn't. Maybe that's because the ideas have gotten narrower; they've certainly gotten slighter. His whimsies can be charming, his jokes are often worth a chuckle, and he couldn't ask for more sensitive accompanists than Richard Thompson and Anton Fier. Maybe someday he'll write a Peter and the Wolf for our time.
"
FALSE,B,Monster Walks the Winter Lake,David Thomas and the Wooden Birds,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8490,"
David's in fine talk-show form on side one, peddling metaphysics and quoting dictionaries and wending his way through the associative title tale. The music follows along just right, and his monster postscripts are also fun. But side two is associative enough to make one wonder just how interesting one fellow's fantasy life can be.
"
FALSE,B,One Clear Moment,Linda Thompson,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8492,"
Nothing like a busted marriage to bring out the latent feminism in a woman, and this one has a mouth on her--""Hell, High Water and Heartache"" makes me wonder whether she got cheated out of some publishing on ""Hard Luck Stories."" So lyrics, while not always brilliant, aren't the problem. Problem's musical conception, which between producer Hugh Murphy and collaborator Betsy Cook turns this into the best Carly Simon record I've heard in a while.
"
FALSE,B,Strict Tempo!,Richard Thompson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8493,"
Cut in 1981, these ""traditional and modern tunes for all occasions"" are strictly instrumental, with Dave Mattacks holding the tempo. They're recommended to folkies, ex-folkies, guitar adepts, and students of European song. The Duke Ellington cover excepted, I just wish they swung as much as the rest of Thompson's catalogue.
"
FALSE,B,Small Town Romance,Richard Thompson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8494,"
What can it mean that the five best cuts on this live-and-unaccompanied-in-1982 cult item are the five he's never recorded before. It means that as a singer he has real trouble carrying slow songs that were designed for Linda and/or a band, preferably both, and that his solo versions of the fast ones can't compete with a memory. Granted, his new songs are so winning cultists won't care. What this half-cultist wonders is how much he knew when he wrote the oh-so-true ""Love Is Bad for Business.""
"
FALSE,B,"(Guitar, Vocal)",Richard Thompson,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8495,"
Thompson was once the most scandalously unavailable English artist in America. Now he not only has a cult that sells compilation cassettes to fanzine subscribers, he has a cult that includes a small record company. Which in addition to compiling this not unpleasing two-record set of outtakes and live stuff keeps all his real albums in print. That's a hint.
"
FALSE,B,Daring Adventures,Richard Thompson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2946,"
I don't think it's the material and I hope it's not Thompson--with nuevo roots hack Mitchell Froom introducing his charge to the band and then saying go, there's no way to be sure. Somebody put those guitar breaks in an emulator right now.
"
FALSE,B,First Light,Richard & Linda Thompson,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2941,"
Richard T. has always redeemed corny themes with a humor dry enough to be mistaken for nasty, as when he includes ""I'll punch you in the nose"" in a list of odd jobs he'll do. But nowhere else on ""Restless Highway,"" ""Sweet Surrender,"" and ""The Choice Wife Died for Love""--the bulk of side one--do the lyrics deviate from the expectable. Just as distressing, the guitar veers away from Thompson's unique, timeless modalism toward the studio country-rock favored by new sidemen Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark. I love ""Strange Affair,"" one of his greatest death songs yet, and still find the austere harmonies bracing. But I want the Thompsons' pervasive Anglicism straight when I want it at all.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Mixes/The Best of Thompson Twins,The Thompson Twins,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3879,"
Their star power was so evanescent that they commemorate themselves as a dance act rather than a pop act, which is fine as far as song selection goes--this is most of what you'll want to remember before you forget. But from a pop perspective the Thompsons are why DOR turned into a dirty acronym: their tepid beats will drift anyone who isn't an acolyte of cool off the floor, and their pop is so wispy it fades before their dance mixes are over.
"
FALSE,B,George Thorogood and the Destroyers,George Thorogood and the Destroyers,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1389,"
What is it that a blues interpreter black or white is supposed to do? Something about making the song his (or hers, Bonnie)--the way Mick Jagger always does, even on his absurd version of ""I Just Wanna Make Love to You."" Thorogood claims only ""One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer."" And if the rest sounds good when it comes on the radio, that says more about the radio than it does about the rest.
"
FALSE,B,Move It on Over,George Thorogood and the Destroyers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8004,"
It's impossible not to be charmed by Thorogood's enthusiasm, and instrumentally this band is as likable as, say, Hound Dog Taylor's HouseRockers. But only closet folkies could vest hope in a noncomposer whose taste in material is markedly less interesting than the Blues Brothers' and whose only virtue as a vocalist is his complete lack of embarrassment. Harmless, but inconsequential.
"
FALSE,B,It Ain't Easy,Three Dog Night,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8005,"
Admitting it won't gain me any of the hip cachet I crave, but I admired and enjoyed this group's first LP. I found the second mediocre and the live job that followed it wretchedly excessive, but this one--their fourth in just fourteen months--gets back: exemplary song-finding and not too much plastic-soul melon-mouthing or preening vocal pyrotechnique. Highlights: the hit version of Randy Newman's ""Mama Told Me Not to Come,"" with just the right admixture of high-spirited schlock to turn it into the AM giant it deserves to be, and a departure from pre-Beatles times called ""Good Feeling (1957).""
"
FALSE,B,The Death of Everything,The Three Johns,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6094,"
Descrying the ""gothic"" tattoo that ID's a cartoon Jon Langford on the inner sleeve, I was reminded, invidiously, of his fondness for the Sisters of Mercy. The Johns are political jokers, hence not gothic two ways. But there isn't a track here as high-powered (or funny, or politically efficient) as ""This Corrosion,"" and from the sound Adrian Sherwood gets out of ""Never and Always,"" I just know Langford wishes there was. As well he might.
"
FALSE,B,Too Much Junkie Business,Johnny Thunders,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8504,"
Forced to chose between this Jimmy Miller-coproduced miscellany and the French live-LP-plus-studio-EP In Cold Blood--not to mention PVC's French-EP-plus-bait Diary of a Lover--I'd dig out So Alone or Live at Max's and ponder his spent youth. The tape costs less and has more new songs than the French package, which sounds better and runs a little longer. But neither sustains for more than five minutes at a stretch. Even from JT I expect consistency some of the time.
"
FALSE,B,Tiffany,Tiffany,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8505,"
As a commercial strategy, following a merely schlocky cover of a schlock-rock classic with the better of two schlock ballads was aces--number-one singles, double-platinum LP, what more could a svengali ask? But she's got better in her. This is a fantasy album about the growing pains of a wholesome California teen, flexing her sexuality slightly as she moons over that soulful Mexican boy, with two schlock classics of its own: ""Should've Been Me,"" jealously obsessing on an ex-boyfriend's jacket, and ""I Saw Him Standing There,"" which drags a rock and roll classic through the mud by its cheesy Prince-schlock synth riff. Beatlemaniacs who aren't even dead yet will roll over in their graves. I can't wait.
"
FALSE,B,Ancient Heart,Tanita Tikaram,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6120,"
Figure on some ethereal escapist or new age poseur and the dark, throaty contralto will bring you up short--it recalls much uglier people, like Marianne Faithfull, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell. The voice retains its interest, too--which is not repaid by promising lyrics that don't benefit from a lyric sheet or ingratiating tunes that deserve more help than Rod Argent can provide.
"
FALSE,B,Libby Titus,Libby Titus,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11311,"
I don't like this woman, who strikes me as a cutesy-pie snob with starfucker tendencies. But there's something sultry and smart in her voice that turns me on. And although there are too many Carly Simon compositions on side two (now I know--it's the singer and the song), I suspect I'll be playing side one again some time, no doubt when I'm in the mood for a sharp cutie-pie who might conceivably mistake me for a star.

FALSE,B,Modern Scream,Lily Tomlin,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11283,"
When I hear Tomlin impersonate Suzie Sorority or explain how she managed to play a heterosexual in Nashville (""I've seen these women all my life, so I know how they walk, I know how they talk"".) I thank God for making us a woman comedian instead of another light comedienne. Next time, though, I hope She makes her a little funnier.
"
FALSE,B,Just Like That,Toots and the Maytals,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4022,"
""Turn It Over"" is an instrumental. So's ""Turn It Up."" ""Chatty Chatty"" is a charming throwaway. So's ""Dilly Dally."" Let's Get It Together"" is a message number. So's ""Israel Children."" ""Journeyman"" is about just who you'd hope, for better and worse.
"
FALSE,B,Legalize It,Peter Tosh,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8010,"
Unlike most sidemen who go on to pursue their own artistic interests, ex-Wailer Tosh has managed to gather about half an album for his solo debut, which ain't bad. ""Ketchy Shuby"" even has the makings of a novelty hit. But oh, how his light heart and romantic spirit are missed among his old mates.
"
FALSE,B,Wanted Dread or Alive,Peter Tosh,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8512,"
Tosh is more worldly-wise than the average reggae singer--maybe even smarter. Darryl Thompson's guitar gets rock-style solo space on several tracks here, but not rock-style aural prominence, and nice synthesis, and in general the music's subtlety is impressive. Especially if you're impressed by musical subtlety, if you know what I mean. I'm impressed by the Gwen Guthrie duet with the session-name horns pasted on. It stinks.
"
FALSE,B,Mama Africa,Peter Tosh,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8513,"
A surprisingly good album from a man who's been acting the fool for years, but the quality's in the groove, not the man--and in the Afrogroove rather than the reggae groove at that. Best songs: ""Stop That Train,"" which he almost ruins with lounge-roots phrasing, and ""Maga Dog,"" which has never sounded better. Both were written in the '60s.
"
FALSE,B,Ali Farka Tour,Ali Farka Tour,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=84,"
A Malian whose guitar owes onetime employer John Lee Hooker, Toure fascinates students of the Africa-blues connection, and his side-openers and foot-stomping Hook tribute are good to hear. Nevertheless, I prefer my blues with a rhythm section. I also prefer Hook.
"
FALSE,B,Toussaint,Allen Toussaint,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8012,"
""Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky,"" announces the pianist-composer-producer-arranger behind dozens of New Orleans hits on a great cut that Lee Dorsey did even better, but lurking amid the ensuing instrumentals are Roger Williams (maybe somebody classier, but that's who it sounds like to me), ""The Hallelujah Chorus,"" and Vince Guaraldi. Granted, on the A side Toussaint sings five excellent songs, four of which he wrote himself. But Joe Simon did better with ""Chokin' Kind."" And Lee Dorsey did better with ""Working in a Coal Mine.""

FALSE,B,Tower of Power,Tower of Power,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8017,"
Come off it, guys. You really lucked out with Lenny Williams and you know it--when he swoops up that way he makes it sound as if Aretha herself ought to cover ""This Time It's Real,"" which isn't likely. So get all those horns out of his face. I know there are five of you, but why not just make fancy with the Pointer Sisters and leave Lenny be? You said it yourselves, or rather, Lenny did: ""Sometimes hipness is what it ain't.""
"
FALSE,B,Live and in Living Color,Tower of Power,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8020,"
I guess they really are hot live if it comes across on the live album--the uptempo numbers have real edge, and Lenny Pickett's long honk on the 23:40-minute ""Knock Yourself Out"" is such a gas it makes the ensuing organ solo endurable. But Hubert Tubbs just isn't Lenny Williams--he makes the appropriate vocal sounds at the appropriate junctures, but that's all. This ruins the ballads, never a strong point. And Lenny Pickett's tweets don't add much either.
"
FALSE,B,The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys,Traffic,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4034,"
These guys waste their talent--they're devoid of intellectual thrust, they've never figured out what to do with their beloved jam form, and more often than not their lyrics are designed only to fill holes in the music or the meter. Yet they're onto something here. Their modest improvisations have a lot more force and hook appeal than the ones of John Barleycorn, they've figured out how to incorporate horns without compromising their electricity, and sometimes it even sounds as if Winwood knows why he's singing. When it works, it suggests a nice paradox--relaxed and exciting at the same time.
"
FALSE,B,Disco Inferno,The Trammps,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3887,"
I hum the title track and admire three of the remaining five, but at a distance. One sharp figure of speech per song--next to ""burn baby burn"" my favorite occurs in ""Body Contact Contract,"" where the ""party of the first part"" parties--doesn't make up for how forced they sound when they're bad--or admirable.
"
FALSE,B,Disco Champs,The Trammps,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8023,"
In theory I'm glad their ex-corporation has repackaged Trammps as a pure disco album. In practice I get distracted during the breaks and don't find the new dance cuts any more appealing than the old ballads.

By Sigue Sigue Sputnik out of Blondie and T. Rex, and some suspect them of being--oh, the shame of it--posers; G. Cosloy claims they are as McDonald's is to a home-cooked meal. Which is what they get for wearing their inauthenticity on their sleeves in a rock and roll nation riven by identity crisis. My complaint is their inadequate command of trash--better riffs are available for hijacking. As things stand, their Holly and the Italians cover cuts not only ""Revolution Baby"" but ""Andy Warhol's Dead.""

As an acoustic warrior, back when he spelled out his group's first name and did concept albums about unicorns, Marc Bolan was considered ""progressive,"" which meant he was as foolish as Donovan but not as famous. A freak hit turned him into a singer of rhythmic fairy tales for British pre-pubes, exactly what he was always suited for, and the great ""Bang a Gong"" extends his subject matter into the rock myth itself, which has its limits but sure beats unicorns. Now if he'd only recycle a few more pop readymades I could stop complaining about fey.

Rather than solving this party band's problems, lead and background vocals from guest producers Kurtis Blow and Bootsy Collins underline it--ain't a one of the four vocalist-percussionist-keybist/bassists up front who's trouble enough.
"
FALSE,B,"More, More, More",The Andrea True Connection,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=114,"
Forget Donna Summer--this is the real disco porn. She's covered on the cover right up to the clavicle, her rhythms sound more binary than her producer's, and she can't sing a lick. But even if you haven't seen her movies, she projects an exhibitionistic suck-and-fuck tractability that links the two pervasive fantasy media of our time, and from such conjunctions Great Art arises.
"
FALSE,B,Beneath the Shadows,True Sounds of Liberty,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8529,"
Musically and verbally, TSOL stand between the high-school protest of L.A. neopunk and the collegiate lyricism of L.A. neopsychedelia. Wordwise this is half a disaster--their colors running into the sand are even less interesting than Black Flag's antiauthoritarian rant or the Dream Syndicate's postnarcissistic angst. It's only because of the lyric sheet that you notice, though--Jack Delauge yawps out catchphrases as passable as anybody's and pretty much garbles the rest. And while the musical synthesis isn't as formally sophisticated as that of the more fashionable new American sound bands, it's more direct, so robust and determined it blows all suspicions of nostalgia away.
"
FALSE,B,Drifters,True West,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8531,"
They're still loud, they're still songful, but the balance is now so cautious that their elegiac, hard-driving Television-goes-country-rock wins this month's Trouser Press Memorial What-Does-It-All-Mean Award for Formalism, an eye-catching statuette of gilded virgin vinyl that looks kind of like an ear and kind of like a question mark. Blame it on the new drummer if you want. My guess is attrition, a/k/a maturity.
"
FALSE,B,Mental Decay,Tru Fax and the Insaniacs,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8532,"
So many indie LPs are as useless as the slimiest megacorp product that this near-miss from D.C. is worth remembering. Diana Quinn's fey feminism and David Wells's broken buzzsaw ride the flat garage rhythms as far as they'll go, which means their half-absurdist ditties work best when they're purely satirical. ""Up in the Air"" is the funniest (and archest) anti-Reagan song to date and ""Washington"" hits suburbia where it lives (for once).
"
FALSE,B,"""The Best"" Ambiance",Bibi Den's Tshibaya,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8533,"
From Africa via la France, another four-cut disco (""soukous"") album from the authenticity-mongers in Somerville. Because it's disco, it's more useful than most authenticity; because it's authentic, it's more engaging than most disco. Next.
"
FALSE,B,Livin' and Learnin',Tanya Tucker,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8037,"
The gain in assurance and excitement should put to rest all narrow-spirited suspicions that only Billy Sherrill's cracker acumen can shape Tanya's voice. But the voice remains a dirty one, which means that those songs that broaden her appeal by forcing her to play the ingenue tend to unfocus the persona behind subtler lyrics like Sterling Whipple's ""Makin' Love Don't Always Make Love Grow."" Highlights: two rockers, one from Fats Domino, the other from the Eagles.
"
FALSE,B,Bad Dreams,Ike Turner,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8041,"
After twenty years of raking it in from the shadows, he's finally figured out a way of applying his basically comic bass/baritone to rock and roll. Studio-psychedelic New Orleans, echoes of the Band and Dr. John, some brilliant minor r&amp;b mixed in with the dumb stuff. My God--at the moment he's more interesting than Tina.
"
FALSE,B,Workin' Together,Ike & Tina Turner,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8043,"
There's a pretty fair remake of ""Ooh Poo Pah Doo"" in between the two great cuts on this album--the easy-to-rough ""Proud Mary"" (with Ike rolling in back) and their first successful ""peace and love"" ""generation"" song, appropriately entitled ""Funkier Than a Mosquita's Tweeter."" Someone named Eki Renrut contributes a pretty fair do-right-man song. And Tina tries valiantly to sing her way out of some gunny sacks.
"
FALSE,B,Ron Turner,Ron Turner,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8049,"
This folkie throwback supports the argument that it's easier to play the outlaw if you don't need roadies with pack mules to lug your amplifiers across the wide open spaces. Armed with a twelve-string and a sense of humor, Turner obviously yokes his imagination to felt experience than production schedules, and his flat monotone is often pretty droll. He makes rock and roll sound even bleaker.
"
FALSE,B,Acid Queen,Tina Turner,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8050,"
Her rock myth reconfirmed cinematically, Tina quickly turns out two from the Who (only fair), two from the Stones (who else?), and one from Led Zep (""Whole Lotta Love,"" brilliant, I trust R. Plant has his big twelve-inch in a sling at this very moment). With bass lines lifted whole from the originals the singing almost doesn't matter. And what rocks most mythically? I. Turner's cleverly entitled ""Baby--Get It On.""
"
FALSE,B,Tina Live in Europe,Tina Turner,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6098,"
Almost two hours of double-LP, with an extra half of covers on cassette and CD, and not as pointless as you think. It's interesting to hear songs originally crafted for 64-track crossover streamlined or steamrollered by the gruffly inexorable forward motion of a crack road show, and sometimes--a ""Break Every Rule"" with that live elle-sait-quoi followed by a sharply funky ""I Can't Stand the Rain,"" or most of side three, from Pickett parlay to Cray and Clapton cameos to the inevitable ""Proud Mary""--there are transformations or revelations. Then there's the Bryan Adams cameo. And before that there are the David Bowie cameos--two of the ugly things.
"
FALSE,B,"Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes",TV on the Radio,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12506,"
Intelligent, honest, and original ought to be enough. But in fact there are acres, tons, and years of bad art that share these virtues, especially if ""original"" is interpreted generously, which it better be with the world's hundredth or thousandth guitars-and-loops outfit. Really. Take-him-or-leave-him singer. No great shakes melodically or rhythmically. Approximately as insightful in re the exigencies of male-and-female as 50 years of male chauvinists before them. Always humorless, sometimes sententious. All told, pretty dull--unless you're so desperate that you'll sing hosanna for every piece of intelligent-honest-original that comes down the circuit.
"
FALSE,B,Twilley Don't Mind,Dwight Twilley Band,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1104,"
If the twelve-cut debut was notable for its songs, this nine-cut follow-up puts the emphasis on sound--a deep, rather eerie, yet undeniably pop sound that reminds me more than anything of the Flamin' Groovies' Supersnazz. And as with the Flamin' Groovies, the sound creates a distance between Twilley and his hooks. But even though I can make up neat theories about how Twilley evokes a comparable distance in the lyrics, I certainly prefer Supersnazz.
"
FALSE,B,Conway Twitty's Greatest Hits Volume II,Conway Twitty,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8055,"
Twitty has grown artistically, which I guess is admirable in a forty-three-year-old country singer. I can only guess because although I'm glad he's traded big-ballad stolidity for honky-tonk stretch and catch, I'm not so glad he's writing his own songs. Too often he muddles country's adult themes with the teen romanticism of his early rockabilly success, and sometimes he's just inept--in ""The Games That Daddies Play"" a seven-year-old makes a speech that could have been written by the seven-year-old's therapist, while in ""Don't Cry Joni"" there are plot details that could have been devised by a seven-year-old.
"
FALSE,B,The Very Best of Conway Twitty,Conway Twitty,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8056,"
For me it's simple. I like Conway on classic--which means guilt- or pain-ridden--cheating songs. I don't like him so much when he starts comparing his wife invidiously to some idealized Linda, Georgia, or honky-tonk angel. And on ordinary country songs he's a slightly better than ordinary country singer.
"
FALSE,B,2 Nice Girls,Two Nice Girls,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4057,"
With Nice Girl number three helping them do the Roches, their hook is ""Sweet Jane"" with a Joan Armatrading tag, tart and pretty enough to show up the C. Junkies' suicidal tendencies. Ex-Meat Joy Gretchen Phillips's salty attitude permeates the discreetly physical lesbian love song ""Goons"" and the regretfully rowdy lesbian love anthem ""I Spent My Last $10.00 (On Birth Control and Beer)."" Laurie Freelove counts Cat Stevens among her influences.
"
FALSE,B,UB40 CCCP--Live in Moscow,UB40,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8540,"
To the usual concert-album flaws of redundancy (Labour of Love and Rat in the Kitchen revisited) and speedup (what do Russians know of deep grooves?), UB40 adds a presumably well-intentioned attempt to cram an hour of music onto one vinyl disc. As a result, the vocals are even hollower and duller than you'd expect--on vinyl. The CD, wouldn't you know, is markedly richer and clearer. But for sheer audio I still prefer Little Baggariddim.
"
FALSE,B,Labour of Love II,UB40,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4076,"
The differences are subtle, like everything with this band--rather then being dashed, your high hopes for the sequel succumb to a lingering illness. The beat glides a little too much, the synth washes a little too much, Ali Campbell sings the prize covers a little less and runs them through his voice a little more. And maybe, just maybe, the covers themselves aren't quite as prize.
"
FALSE,B,U.K. Squeeze,U.K. Squeeze,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7846,"
Musically, the instrumental is the only boring cut on the whole first side, but the record as a whole is a case study in excitingly adequate hard rock craftsmanship spoiled by trashy literature. When a band obviously influenced by Queen, Rock Scene, muscle mags, and boarding-school porn finishes off by advising their postpunk admirers to ""get smart,"" it sounds like they want 'em to stop reading Hustler and start reading Oui.
"
FALSE,B,Ultravox!,Ultravox,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4079,"
""I want to be a machine"" is their slogan, and with Eno producing one would hope for the best. But only on ""My Sex"" do they go all the way; more often these tough-surfaced post-Velvets songs identify with ""the wild, the beautiful, and the damned."" Eno helps them sound like a machine regardless, but unlike Eno they don't seem to enjoy it much. Which calls their humanity into question.
"
FALSE,B,Face to Face With the Truth,The Undisputed Truth,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11720,"
Connoisseurs of Motown nouveau find this impossibly slick and fakey, which is just what I like about it. Admittedly, it's nowhere near as good as good Marvin Gaye, but its failures aren't as bathetic, either.
"
FALSE,B,Urban Dance Party,The Urbations,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8548,"
""Goin' to Alpena, Cement Capital of the World,"" begins the twelve-bar blues that begins this tape, and I wish I could tell you it ever got that good again. Andy Boller and Mr. Dr. Blurt Sandblaster do enjoy their laughs--listen to the roller-rink organ Boller lays beneath the horny ""I Need a Job""--but they don't write or sing with the difference that can raise neoclassicist white r&amp;b to the level of necessity.
"
FALSE,B,UTFO,UTFO,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8550,"
For years rappers boasted that they were in it for the money, which given the amounts of money involved proved how close to the street they still were. These days you can't be so sure. After announcing their educated synthesis with a verse in pig Latin on their first single, the new guys on the block have proven street professionals--if they don't use a rhyming dictionary, then they'll probably market one. And Full Force comes up with the one great hook Roxanne Roxanne needs.
"
FALSE,B,Skeezer Pleezer,UTFO,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8551,"
Some of their sketches and tall tales--especially the cheerfully amoral anticrime versifying of ""Just Watch""--sound observed. But too often the gimmicks are received and the generalizations fabricated. And they can not ""sing a little bit.""
"
FALSE,B,Wide Awake in America,U2,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8553,"
Especially after their unstinting live mini, this four-cut ""special low priced collection of live recordings and out takes from the Unforgettable Fire tour and album"" looks like the usual special low priced gyp. But though the outtakes wouldn't have been missed, they're OK to hear, and the opener, an eight-minute amplification of one of Unforgettable Fire's more obscure titles, is why they could get away with superstar rip-offs if they wanted. Maybe Bono's charisma assumes special access to truth, but he doesn't act like that makes him more important than anyone else, and the Edge's elegiac guitar is self-effacing in much the same way--it exists to serve the awesome effect. Epic humility--take it or leave it.
"
FALSE,B,The Joshua Tree,U2,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4064,"
Let it build and ebb and wash and thunder in the background and you'll hear something special--mournful and passionate, stately and involved. Read the lyrics and you won't wince. Tune in Bono's vocals and you'll encounter one of the worst cases of significance ever to afflict a deserving candidate for superstardom.
"
FALSE,B,Give Me the Reason,Luther Vandross,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8558,"
If only Luther had a little less integrity he might sell out--he's such a great singer he could transform crossover twaddle into universal trivia without even breathing hard. Alas, he's also such a great singer he doesn't have to. But not such a great singer he can interest simple pop fans in his own songs.
"
FALSE,B,Women and Children First,Van Halen,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8559,"
Eddie VH's quicksilver whomp earns the Hendrix comparisons, and he's no clone--he's faster, colder, more structural. David Lee Roth adds a wild-ass sophistication to the usual macho--no mortal arena singer would even think of the goofy country blues takeoff that provides the title. But the message of the music isn't the exuberance of untrammeled skill, it's the arrogance of unchallenged mastery. Without being pompous about it, which is a plus, these guys show as little feeling for their zonked, hopelessly adoring fans as Queen. They're kings of the hill and we're not.
"
FALSE,B,Wild-Eyed Dream,Ricky Van Shelton,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8361,"
In his white cowboy hat and sleeveless undershirt, he's as honest as George Strait with a day job--except maybe when picking an album title, because like most neotraditionalists he's too damned tasteful to stay wild-eyed long. As I hope he's noticed, the outlandish ""Crime of Passion"" is his ticket to ride. Guarantee you it will be remembered when all the small perfect moments surrounding it have passed into good-taste limbo.
"
FALSE,B,Texas Flood,Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3343,"
People who think white guitarists with the blues are the essence of rock and roll never fully account for Alvin Lee, not to mention Robin Trower. I think rock and roll's essence inheres in momentum and song form, and find my attention wandering after the kickoff originals ""Love Struck Baby"" and ""Pride and Joy.""
"
FALSE,B,Beautiful Thing,Ben Vaughn Combo,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8567,"
Unlike many comedians, this mild-mannered male chauvinist is funniest when he lets on how clever he is, as in ""Jerry Lewis in France,"" ""Growin' a Beard,"" and ""I'm Sorry (But So Is Brenda Lee),"" only one of which he was clever enough to put on his first U.S. album. He'll never be a Crenshaw (definitive ""Brenda Lee""), but his rockabilly as whisper and idea has gained oomph--if he lets it all hang out he may eventually be as commercial as the Morells (definitive ""Growin' a Beard"").
"
FALSE,B,Generic Blues Album,Maurice John Vaughn,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6232,"
""Don't you play the name game/`Cause the quality is the same"" is just one of ""Generic Blues""'s many zingers, and he almost gets away with the conceit. I don't know, though--lacks identity somehow.
"
FALSE,B,Escape From Babylon,Martha Velez,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11305,"
This Marley-produced reggae venture suffers from the fatal reggae monotony, but she's a warm, accomplished singer in a solidly intelligent groove, and her seriousness is established. If you're looking for women artists to relate to, this is a hell of a lot better place to start than Wendy Waldman.
"
FALSE,B,Voyage,Voyage,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8069,"
The ultimate kitsch--travelogue disco. For instance, what udderlike instrument do you think might be featured on ""Scotch Machine""?
"
FALSE,B,The Best of Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton,Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8070,"
There are real pleasures here, but they're chiefly vocal. The surprises are few, the jokes weak and infrequent, the sentimentality overripe (""Jeanie's Afraid of the Dark,"" yeucch), and the best song's by Paxton, nor Parton. In short, a lousy ad for couple-bonding, though whether Porter is repressing Dolly or Dolly holding out on Porter I wouldn't know.
"
FALSE,B,Protest,Bunny Wailer,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8071,"
Neither Bunny's voice, strong by Jamaican standards but no soul shout, nor reggae's persuasive but rarely irrefutable rhythms, are suited to the more forceful (or is it just louder?) procedures of this follow-up. The decrease in compassion, consolation, and--most directly to the political point--inspiration is less a matter of the words themselves than of how they're sung, but never on the last record did he resort to such radio-preacher pretensions as ""the rock of discretion/Will calm the floods of conflict."" Not to mention an antiabortion line.
"
FALSE,B,Rule Dance Hall,Bunny Wailer,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8585,"
Bunny follows his failed bid for the marketplace by going to the people where his roots are. The results are definitely more ital, and more philosophically defensible as well. But the first side doesn't update his circa-1982 reggae&amp;b quite nicely enough, and except for the ""Stir It Up"" remake, the songs on side two are a little too dubwise--abstractly dance-specific in the usual manner of disco turned in on itself.
"
FALSE,B,Liberation,Bunny Wailer,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=502,"
He's studied his history, and the politics of his major statement are pretty smart. But ordinarily, only earnest organizer types who distribute lyrics at rallies (""To the tune of `Down by the Riverside'"") think they can get a rousing song out of a line like ""The OAU and the United Nations must stop all hypocritical sanctions."" Bunny should know better than to hire studio musicians to do what they're told.
"
FALSE,B,Fame and Wealth,Loudon Wainwright III,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8587,"
Loudon's most confident album since he split with CBS in 1975 is also his least ambitious, done folkie-style with two penetrating embellishments from Richard Thompson and two band cuts. For a while he walks his old tightrope, wild and nasty enough to make his chronic egoism seem of general interest. But the jokes and feelings are getting thinner, and soon you'll find yourself wishing he'd grow up, shut up, or both.
"
FALSE,B,Nighthawks at the Diner,Tom Waits,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8076,"
When he really works at evoking the swizzle-stick blues, Waits is so full of shit Port-O-San ought to name a model after him. Fortunately, this one's long on patter--first live double in history where you skip the song to get to the next intro. (And some of the songs are worth going back to.)
"
FALSE,B,Foreign Affairs,Tom Waits,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8078,"
I like the poetry-with-jazz for ""Jack &amp; Neal,"" the mumbled monologue ""Barber Shop,"" the Anglophile ""Foreign Affair,"" and a duet with Bette on ""I Never Talk to Strangers."" But I get off the trolley at ""Potter's Field,"" a production number for a high-rolling nightstick who crossed ""from the Bronx to the River Styx."" With his genre sleaze and metaphorical melodrama, Waits is a downwardly mobile escapist who believes that Everyman is a wino and Everywoman an all-night waitress who turns tricks when things get rough. The problem isn't the subjects themselves, but that for all his self-conscious unpretentiousness he inflates them. Which I guess is all we can expect of a schoolteacher's son who's been searching for his own world since he was old enough to think.
"
FALSE,B,Blue Valentine,Tom Waits,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8079,"
Waits keeps getting weirder and good for him. As sheer sendup, his ""Somewhere"" beats Sid Vicious's ""My Way"" his way. But I'm not always sure he understands his gift--these lyrics should be funnier. And ""Romeo Is Bleeding,"" easily my favorite among his Chandleroid sagas of tragedy outside the law, is more effective on the jacket than when he underlines its emotional resonance in song. That's not weird at all.
"
FALSE,B,Heartattack and Vine,Tom Waits,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8591,"
Lurching from hip to bathetic in his doomed pursuit of the let's-get-wasted market, he needs an editor more than Jack Kerouac ever did. But Kerouac rarely came up with tropes as axiomatic as ""I sold a quart of blood and bought a half a pint of Scotch"" or ""If you don't get my letter, then you'll know that I'm in jail,"" neither of which ought to spend their lives buried in overgrown verbiage and stentorian second-line. And sometimes he gets away with his shit, as in the tearfully tuneful ""Jersey Girl"" or the blisteringly bluesy ""Mr. Siegal""--or ""Heartattack and Vine,"" which could make you hope he's getting tired of getting wasted.
"
FALSE,B,Franks Wild Years,Tom Waits,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3998,"
Amid these fragments from a musical that wouldn't make all that much sense fully staged, you'll find five-six songs that stand on their own--couple howlin' blues, coupla tuneful heart-tuggers, coupla Wayne Newton parodies. But if in the '20s Rudy Vallee sang through a megaphone because he wanted to sound modern, in the '80s Waits sings through a megaphone because he wants to sound old. This being the '80s, you're free to prefer Waits--as long as you don't kid yourself too much about his conceptual thrust.
"
FALSE,B,Big Time,Tom Waits,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5947,"
Sure he's an American original and all that. But from half-assed one-man original-cast album to soundtrack of filmed live show, Waits continues to confound the categories more aimlessly than seems necessary. Not counting one shaggy testicle story, the sharpest moments here subject overlooked songs to a crack cabaret-tinged band. From American originals I expect bigger surprises.
"
FALSE,B,Blue Soul,Joe Louis Walker,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8595,"
I know, life is never this simple. But last time bass player Henry Oden had four songwriting credits, three of them winners. This time he's got none. Standout: the unsoullike, unaccompanied ""I'll Get to Heaven on My Own.""
"
FALSE,B,Sippie Wallace,Sippie Wallace,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8596,"
This project scrapes by on taste and good intentions--the selection of songs by Wallace and contemporaries, Bonnie Raitt's unobtrusive voice and slide, and the impeccable swing of pianist Jim Dapogny and his Chicago Jazz Band. The problem is that where Alberta Hunter commands an almost regal strength in her eighties, Wallace sounds like a cartoon granny with denture problems. Her lyrics still sting after half a century, and her phrasing puts them across, but she doesn't even hint at the young Sippie's hard-won erotic composure. CBS and RCA: reissue.
"
FALSE,B,Call of the West,Wall of Voodoo,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8597,"
Those who believe synth-pop means that the end is near should cf. WoV's 1980 EP, which gave no hint they were capable of tunes as neat and witty as ""Mexican Radio"" or ""Lost Weekend."" Maybe soon vocalist-lyricist Stanard Ridgway will fall in love with a human and start pretending he's a nice guy.
"
FALSE,B,The World Is a Ghetto,War,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4132,"
According to all my own theories, I should love this big Afro-roots band with the number one album, but it's hard. Jazz pretensions are one problem--""City, Country, City"" has a firm bottom, but it's thirteen minutes long, and up top is mush. And if ""That's What Love Will Do"" was Vanilla Fudge, ""Four Cornered Room"" makes me think they're trying to start their own genre--blackstrap-rock, they could call it.
"
FALSE,B,Galaxy,War,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8091,"
The first side of the most unambitious album they've ever made works beautifully as what it is--P-Funk on thorazine, with the phrasemaking acuity of previous War records reduced to one title, ""Sweet Fighting Lady."" Side two winds down from a pretty good hit single into fourteen minutes of carrying unambitiousness way too far.
"
FALSE,B,Outlaw,War,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8599,"
The pan-Afro-American groove is sharper and the tempos often approach medium fast, but the music sounds almost vintage anyway and that's the big surprise--why should they make their best album nearly a decade after their prime? Professionalism is its own reward--for once. Almost.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Steve Wariner,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8600,"
""What I Didn't Do"" puts sins of omission on country's conjugal hit list. ""Small Town Girl"" concentrates the whole of a genre's nostalgia on one overburdened woman from back home. ""The Weekend"" takes him off the deep end and he figures better that than nothing. After that, it's pretty generic--but likably generic, which in MOR country is an accomplishment these days.
"
FALSE,B,The London Muddy Waters Sessions,Muddy Waters,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8098,"
Howlin' Wolf had the Rolling Stones for his London session, so how come Muddy only got Rory Gallagher, Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, and Mitch Mitchell for his? Maybe because this one was a money gig from the git-go. Anyway, only Gallagher--the sole committed blues player of the four--is exceptional, and Muddy sounds like the aging pro he is. One exception is ""Blind Man Blues,"" with nice backup from Rosetta Hightower. The other is ""Walkin' Blues,"" featuring nobody but Muddy and Sam Lawhorn, who is from Chicago.
"
FALSE,B,I'm Ready,Muddy Waters,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2477,"
Not as ready as you were last time, Mud, but don't let it worry you--it's always harder to get hard again again.

FALSE,B,Radio KAOS,Roger Waters,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8602,"
In which Waters's wheelchair-bound version of the deaf, dumb, and blind boy learns to control the world's computers with his cordless phone, then simulates impending nuclear holocaust just to scare the shit out of the powers that be. I have serious reservations about any record that can't be enjoyed unless you sit there reading the inner sleeve, but this is not without its aural rewards--a coverable song or two and some nice comping on shakuhachi as well as the deep engineering that made Floyd famous. As pretentious goes, not stupid.

FALSE,B,Big Girls Don't Cry,The Weather Girls,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8606,"
At a moment when soul is resurfacing as an ear-catching set of usages, a form basically independent of its original sources, these fat ladies--abetted by a new production team, and so it goes--take it one step further and make soul a cartoon, with the title cut the masterstroke. They'll cop material anywhere--debut single's from Jesse Winchester. And if at first their tricks seem inspired, by the time you get to Creedence and Neil Sedaka they're beginning to sound obvious.
"
FALSE,B,Weather Report,Weather Report,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8101,"
In a Silent Way played mostly for atmosphere. The Milesian demi-jazz of side two sounds pretty finky (no misprint intended), but the tone-poem impressionism of side one does its mysterious work. Highlight: the opening mood piece, ""Milky Way,"" in which two Silent Way vets, soprano saxophonist Wayne Shorter and pianist Joe Zawinul, make sounds that suggest a carillon approaching a time warp.
"
FALSE,B,I Sing the Body Electric,Weather Report,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4157,"
Significantly less Milesian than their debut, which is impressive but not necessarily good--the difference is that this is neater, more antiseptic, its bottom less dirty and its top less sexy. I find myself interested but never engaged, and I'm sure one piece is a flop--""Crystals,"" described by the annotator as ""about"" time. Sing the body electric and I'm with you. Sing the body short-circuited and you'd better turn me on.
"
FALSE,B,Sweetnighter,Weather Report,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4158,"
Ask yourself: What kind of a jazz (or rock) (or jazz-rock) group would conceive its sonar identity around electric keyboards and soprano sax? A pretty dinky (not dunky) one, right? So while I'm pleased that they're going for a drum groove a little solider than anything Dom Um Romao can move and shake, I'm not surprised that they get it only--just barely, in fact--on ""125th Street congress."" And that ""Boogie Woogie Waltz"" is fatally cute, ace improvisations and all.
"
FALSE,B,Mysterious Traveler,Weather Report,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4159,"
Not bad, not bad--but is that all there is? Maybe what makes the traveller so mysterious is that he doesn't go anywhere in particular. Not even with Alphonso Johnson pushing like hell from underneath.
"
FALSE,B,Mr. Gone,Weather Report,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8103,"
I don't think it was the advent of Jaco Pastorius that triggered the band's ever more fusoid tendencies. Professional evolution, that's all. Like Black Market and Heavy Weather, this is short on rhythmic inspiration (four different drummers, no percussionists) and long on electric ivory. When I'm in the mood I can still get off on its rich colors and compositional flow. When I'm not I think dark thoughts about Muzak and Yurrup.
"
FALSE,B,Mountain,Leslie West,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11543,"
With Felix Pappalardi singing and playing bass regularly this could be New York's third supergroup. (The Rascals and the Spoonful got there first.) The visual possibilities alone--with West, the enormous ex-Vagrant guitarist, set against the hyperactive Pappalardi, are fantastic. West plays good guitar and is a good roarer, and Pappalardi is not only first-rate on several instruments but has a wonderful singing voice, sweet and mellow. Unfortunately, he hadn't decided to join the group when this was recorded, and so participates only as bassist and producer. West alone can't quite carry it. More like early Cream than Blind Faith.

FALSE,B,Make It Big,Wham!,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8609,"
Though George Michael seems more swellheaded than one would wish in a superstar (or a coworker), he does take care of business! His Isleys cover is less striking than his ersatz Motown! How many other pretty boys can make such a claim?!
"
FALSE,B,The Whispers,The Whispers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8109,"
They've been around forever because they're real pros, but that's all they are. Vocal-group fans will probably enjoy--check out these titles--""Lady"" and ""I Love You"" and ""Welcome Into My Dream,"" though I hope they stop at the sanctimonious ""Song for Donny"" and the pallid ""My Girl."" But what makes this a breakthrough is the three dance tracks. The great one, ""Out the Box,"" was written and coproduced by Leon Sylvers. In the great Sylvers tradition, you could almost mistake it for something you missed on Destiny or Off the Wall.
"
FALSE,B,I've Got So Much to Give,Barry White,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8111,"
White's hustle is to combine Isaac Hayes's power with Al Green's niceness, and he succeeds, in his way, but the synthesis has its drawbacks--tends to compound his humorlessness and mendacity as well. But as a fait accompli he has quite a bit of silly charm, and does he lay down some powerful tracks. Nor is his style as far removed from soul music as white soul conservatives (myself included) first assumed--the bass pulse has a Latin oomph undiminished by its fat-man's pace. And is that a barrelhouse harpsichord on ""Bring Back My Yesterdays""? Very, er, eclectic.
"
FALSE,B,Barry White the Man,Barry White,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8115,"
For those with a high giggle threshold, White's best music in years should prove a more than acceptable fuckalong. That's the A side. On the B side he essays ""Just the Way You Are.""
"
FALSE,B,Ecstasy,White Animals,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8612,"
Despite the off name and kalimba intro, I figured these Nashvillians for an especially one-dimensional bunch of popsters after happy songs like ""This Girl of Mine"" and ""You Started Something"" provided exactly what they promised. But eventually, wondering about the ""Gloria"" remake and the psychedelic blues, I realized that one-dimensionality is . . . not the point, because that would imply irony, but the payoff. Somehow these guys sincerely inhabit a very '60s-ish reality; their message isn't some kind of distanced commentary on their musical material, it's the material itself. They say they like soul, too, and I believe them.
"
FALSE,B,Live at Leeds,The Who,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3915,"
This band has never even tried to simulate stage power in the studio except on its raw debut, which makes side one, with its first-ever recordings of two key live covers and the first version of the classic ""Substitute"" available here on LP, doubly valuable. But side two extrapolates the uncool-at-any-length ""Magic Bus"" and the bish-bash climax of ""My Generation,"" which has to be seen to be believed. I much prefer the raw debut.
"
FALSE,B,Odds and Sods,The Who,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3913,"
Although Peter Townshend's genius (well, for once that's what it is) glimmers through on every one of these leftovers, all that glimmers is not gold, which is why most of them have been in the can for between three and seven years. The great exception is ""Little Billy,"" a cheerful, cruel smoking-is-dangerous-to-your-health song that the American Cancer Society chickened out on; it'd make a great public service ad on The Who Sell Out. There are also two pretty fair rock life songs--and ""Long Live Rock,"" a strained variation on that overworked theme. And to balance off the two pretty good devotional songs there's ""Faith in Something Bigger,"" which could serve as Nashville filler.
"
FALSE,B,The Kids Are Alright,The Who,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8119,"
I prefer the originals, but this isn't a bad sampler. All of the songs are good, many are classics, and the relative roughness of performance has its attractions even if the relative roughness of sound doesn't (most of them are from live dates never intended for vinyl). One thing I'd like to know, though--if he's so ""vital,"" how come twelve of the fifteen Townshend compositions are from the '60s?
"
FALSE,B,It Came from Nashville,Webb Wilder & the Beatnecks,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8623,"
Wilder is about as country as Olivia Newton-John. He's got one of those pencil-necked voices, like he not only went to college (which lots of real men and good old boys do these days) but maybe even prep school. His Steve Earle cover beats his Hank Williams cover, and his best song is about hanging out by a pool with a rule against dogs. And I almost don't care. Any Nashvillean who can honestly urge all his ""patrons in the teen and sub-teen demographic to pursue happiness at every opportunity"" gets slack from me.
"
FALSE,B,"Mud, Lies and Shame",Wild Seeds,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6153,"
A typical Amerindie story. Led by then-rockcrit Michael Hall, the Seeds took their Southwest-boho syncretism public in 1984 with a self-produced EP that hauled in heaps of hosannas, none so impolite as to note that not a single memorable song shored up the band's, what shall we call it, soulful Austin country-punk. Brave, Clean and Reverent, released in 1986 on the local Jungle label, failed to get them much further despite ace side-leaders: ""Sharlene,"" about Hall's crush on a pretty boy, and ""I Work Hard,"" about his compulsion to wage slavery. Now they've graduated to what's called a major indie, and the first three cuts are everything one could have hoped, especially the self-explanatory ""I'm Sorry, I Can't Rock You All Night Long,"" a true classic as these things are measured. The rest continue their project of defeating male chauvinism in the male chauvinist roots-rock context, but not so's you'd notice. In a saner world, this would be their debut album. It would include ""Sharlene"" and ""I Work Hard"" (without horns, please), encouraging everylistener to bear down on their lesser material, the best of which is more than passable. How they would have made a living in the meantime I couldn't tell you. How they make a living now I couldn't tell you either.
"
FALSE,B,I'm So Proud,Deniece Williams,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8626,"
Minnie Riperton she's not--really. Cameos from Johnny Mathis (body) and Philip Bailey (spirit) bring out the character in her pure, intense soprano, and ""Love, Peace and Unity"" mentions the ""arms race"" in a welcome moment of negativity. But Williams has progressed, as they say, from Thom Bell's pop romanticism to George Duke's cosmic idealism, and these fusion guys have never understood about songs.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Don Williams,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8122,"
In which this new country honcho--who as a founder of the Pozo-Seco Singers competed in the '60s downhome sweepstakes with the likes of Jim McGuinn--casts about for a style of gentleness that suits him. At its worst his torpid singing has all of Johnny Cash's monotonousness and none of his majesty. But he does reject the ranker strains of corn.
"
FALSE,B,The New South,Hank Williams Jr.,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8123,"
Dear Up-and-Comer: OK, pretty good for a country-rock album--more spirited than your second, less inspired than your first. But let me mention a few things. The Atlanta Braves are not, repeat not, ordinarily identified with the Old South. Rain gets to be a pretty tedious symbol of life's tribulations. The road gets to be a pretty tedious symbol of life's changes. And if you want to get away from Dad, well, I know it'd be a lot of trouble to change your name, but maybe you could do a whole album that doesn't refer to him at all. And you could stop doing his songs, too--it's bad luck that the best cut here is the one he wrote, now isn't it? I mean, you really could use a new exemplar. Good luck finding him or her. (Signed) Roll on, Dean. P.S. Not Waylon Jennings, either.
"
FALSE,B,Greatest Hits,Hank Williams Jr.,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8628,"
He may be Rosa Luxemburg compared to the Nashville squares he's forever railing against, but he's also a self-indulgent, self-pitying, self-mythologizing MCP, and though this format maximizes the MCP's entertainment and truth value he doesn't get away with ""Kaw-Liga"" or ""Texas Women."" Rosa inspires ""The American Dream,"" which has truths to tell about a Hollywood square with the initials RR. The booster who made his debut on ""The New South"" tells two lies about New York.
"
FALSE,B,Otis Williams and the Midnight Cowboys,Otis Williams and the Midnight Cowboys,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8126,"
In which an old r&amp;b pro (the Charms, remember?) who used to sing harmony on King's country releases heads an all-black country band in a passionately subversive union of two disparate but parallel modes. Granted, his slightly melismatic tenor doesn't equal Charley Pride's penetrating baritone on ""Is Anybody Goin' to San Antone"" or ""Wonder Could I Live There Anymore."" But Charley would never deliver the ""come here boy"" in ""Muleskinner Blues"" with such sarcastic relish.
"
FALSE,B,Barrooms to Bedrooms,David Wills,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11509,"
Q. Can a tear-jerker have a formal precision of its own? A. Maybe, if the singer wears black-rimmed glasses, keeps a microphone in his nose, and doesn't take his seriousness too seriously. Time 25:53.
"
FALSE,B,Wilma,Wilma,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8632,"
Some of their songs do well by such old staples as poststructuralism (""Life Without Adjectives"") and fuck-men (""Love Vaccine""); others don't. Their idiot-avant instrumentals (cf. the Residents, Toiling Midgets) are never as oppressive as Frightwig's generic hardcore, Salem 66's slave-pop, Throwing Muses's muse, etc. And their cover of ""Georgy Girl"" blows away such monumental precedents as the Raincoats' ""Lola"" and Y Pants' ""That's the Way Boys Are."" A sarcastic rollick through a song you never knew meant so much or so little, it's interrupted by a futuristic dream sequence in which Georgy joins a punk band and utters the following Inspirational Verse: ""I suppose you're thinking/We're a little queer/Well my boy I suggest you suck another beer/The bottle's warmyfru/It's got a foamy head/It doesn't cry it doesn't bleed it doesn't wet your bed.""
"
FALSE,B,Nothing But a Breeze,Jesse Winchester,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8133,"
One reason Winchester disappointed after his first album is that he was conceived as a singer-songwriter, expected to deliver a couple of gems and five or six semiprecious stones a year. Finally seeing him live with his cheerful, competent band was a revelation--suddenly he became a country singer who could also rock out. He proves it on this LP, which is, however, short on semiprecious stones and entirely gemless--although ""Gilding the Lily"" turns a cliche the way only a popular song can and the foolishness of ""Rhumba Man"" borders on brilliance.
"
FALSE,B,Run,The Windbreakers,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8636,"
Enough bands fail to craft tuneful yet hard-rocking pop albums to make the success of this Mitch Easter project reviewable: it's tuneful, and it's hard-rocking. But there's nothing in music/vocals/lyrics/image to attract anybody specifically to the Windbreakers, nothing more than there is in Jeffrey Osborne, or Hall &amp; Oates. In fact, they're less interesting than most stars, except maybe to young men who've devoted their lives to blurring the distinction between woman problems and girl trouble.
"
FALSE,B,London Town,Wings,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8138,"
McCartney's lyricism is so capricious, so given to inanity and icky-poo, that only at its very best--""With a Little Luck"" and the affectionate goof on ""Famous Groupies""--does it come on strong. But from its slices of life to its romantic reassurances this is nowhere near as feckless as the Old Band on the Run claque claims--even on the one about the fairy who'll invite us to tea Linda adds a few harmonies that are as charming as they're meant to be. And at the very least you have to be impressed by how steadfastly Paul has resisted supersessions--he's been loyal to his group, which has now recorded longer than the Beatles.
"
FALSE,B,They Only Come Out at Night,The Edgar Winter Group,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8143,"
This may be heavy, but it's fast, which means real rock and roll after the attempted progress and hyperboogie. And instead of hyperthyroid Jerry LaCroix we get Dan Hartman, who knows enough about songs to come up with ""Free Ride,"" and Ronnie Montrose, who knows enough about guitar to get by. Not only that, but Edgar's found a midrange. And not only that but he wears lipstick, eye makeup, and a cheek stud on the cover.
"
FALSE,B,Saints and Sinners,Johnny Winter,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8148,"
I think what puts me off this otherwise searing assertion of rock and roll prowess is the engineering. Rick Derringer has done the standard live-sound job, in which echo is amplified into unnatural ""depth,"" and theoretically that's fine. The average live-sound band is too busy doing promotional tours for its current album to worry about material for the next, but here the songs are lovingly chosen--there's even a good one from the pitiful Richard Supa. Rock and roll the way Johnny likes it, however, was meant to have a human dimension, and since he has trouble projecting irony or intimacy anyhow, a lot of these die a little when Derringer mixes them into heavy cuts.
"
FALSE,B,154,Wire,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4195,"
Predictions that these art-schoolers would turn into art-rockers no longer seem so cynical. Their gift for the horrifying vignette remains. But their tempos are slowing, sometimes to a crawl, as their textures venture toward the orchestral, and neither effect enhances the power of their vignettes, which become ever more personalistic and/or abstract.
"
FALSE,B,Document and Eyewitness,Wire,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8643,"
At first I diagnosed the grungy sound and semipro execution of this live LP-plus-EP as the band's worst case of arty-farty yet. But for all the chatter and false starts and extended instrumental nothings, it packs real momentum--you could even say it gets wild. The new songs are worthy of the name, too. So when it comes to arty-farty, I'll take this over the neaty-beaty of 154. By a hair and a half.
"
FALSE,B,Witch Queen,Witch Queen,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8154,"
Here Gino Soccio's disco goes pop, with the help of the Muscle Shoals boys and three jumpy, skillfully extended blasts from the riff-song past--Redbone's ""Witch Queen,"" Free's ""All Right Now,"" and T. Rex's ""Bang a Gong."" It's nowhere near Muzaky enough to desecrate material so unpretentious, but except for Barry Beckett's chunky piano break on ""Bang a Gong"" it doesn't add much, either.
"
FALSE,B,Naked and Warm,Bill Withers,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8157,"
Here Withers returns to the simple ways of his past, working five or six musicians for the kind of hard groove that doesn't have many parallels in black music these days. And almost succeeds in obscuring the continuing dearth of songs--there are only eight here, and the one that runs 10:46, a paean to L.A., includes a couplet about Disneyland that even I, a convert to Withers's plainspeech, find embarrassing every time out. Recommended single: ""Close to Me.""
"
FALSE,B,Now Look,Ron Wood,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8163,"
Just like former Face and co-Ronnie R. Lane, Wood has something English-folk about him. But with Lane it's deliberate--Wood sounds modal because that's the groove his lost pitch instinctively reverts to. This collaboration with producer-composer Bobby Womack is good for one major love song (""I Got Lost When I Found You""), several minor ones, and a lot of melodies that sound familiar when heard again. Just wish they didn't sound so accidental as well--might help me hum 'em.
"
FALSE,B,Giant,The Woodentops,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8652,"
With their ""move away from cynicism"" and airy touch, these Brits do bear a suspicious resemblance to Howard Jones if not Haircut 100, but at their best they're rootsy and rigorous. At their best, in fact, they ring one more change on the less-is-more magic you always think was exhausted the last time. The analogy is Feelies rather than R.E.M.--the lyrical uplift is a function of rave-up alone, with musical and verbal detail extraneous, as the perky/breathy/hooky/romantic distractions of this shot at the big time demonstrate all too well. ""Shout"" and ""Get It On,"" even ""Love Train"" are their mission in life. ""If we could always be together/It would be so sublime"" is Lionel Richie's.
"
FALSE,B,It's Like This,The Woods,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6208,"
No way it can mean much at this late date, but for a first side that never quits Don Dixon's backup trio sound like relaxed late dB's remaking Crazy Horse as Exile on Main Street. Thus it's one of those off-the-cuff pleasures most Amerindies are too self-involved to provide any more, a busman's holiday rather than an artistic statement and/or a career move. On side two the songs run out, which could be why the career move is declined. Lucky thing--even with a dozen songs they'd be riding for a fall.
"
FALSE,B,Explosion,Betty Wright,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8171,"
Inevitably, she's turning into a warm, perky soul pro, and given how unfashionable simple soul has become we ought to be grateful. But the only times I'm on my knees are on ""I Think I'd Better Think About It,"" in which she resists temptation--to infidelity rather than mere fucking by now--and ""If I Ever Do Wrong,"" in which she thinks some more.
"
FALSE,B,Footprint,Gary Wright,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8173,"
Like his mentor, George O'Hara, Gary makes his spiritual home right next to his musical one, close by that great echo chamber in the sky. But unlike George he writes anthems that are forthright and tuneful--why, even ""Give Me the Good Earth"" is down-to-earth. The ecology-minded will also approve of ""Love to Survive"" and ""Stand for Our Rights,"" both of which are vague enough to appeal to every constituency. Cosmic-commercial lives.
"
FALSE,B,The Bottom Line,O.V. Wright,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8175,"
With its unabashedly country (i.e., rural) singer and its back-to-basics Willie Mitchell production, this one has soul nostalgiacs hot and bothered, but I find the material thin and like it mostly for its oddities: the tribute to Guy Lombardo; the sexy mama who refuses to go, as opposed to get, down by declaring, ""I don't do windows""; and the old man who defines love as ""a misunderstanding between two damn fools.""
"
FALSE,B,Tammy's Greatest Hits Volume II,Tammy Wynette,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8176,"
While no one was looking, that stand-by-your-man gal was writing a female identity song: ""The Only Time I'm Really Me"" (is when I'm asleep--and presumably dreaming). Which is almost cancelled out by one of the most appalling divine justice songs in that godforsaken subgenre: ""The Wonders You Perform"" (at least it's not about her husband). Beyond those two it's the best of the usual--her sultry resignation has archetypal power when the ideology isn't too repellent. It's more archetypal on her first best-of, though.
"
FALSE,B,Womanhood,Tammy Wynette,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8178,"
In which Billy Sherrill performs (or permits) a miracle: five good songs on one side. (Nobody ever accused Bily of thinking big.) On side one, we learn about virtue sorely tempted, the limits of sisterhood, music as emotional communion, virtue abandoned, and the limits of professionalism. On side two, Tammy confuses Wolfman Jack with John the Baptist and then retreats into the commonplace. With country albums, you take what you can get.
"
FALSE,B,Ain't Love Grand,X,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8658,"
After five years of wresting art from commerce and/or vice versa, John and Exene try to have it both ways. Satisfying their bohemian urges with the neofolk Knitters on the art label Slash, they appease their major mentors and keep Billy in the band by taking X to the same producer as Christian heavy metal boys Stryper. Only just as you'd figure, Michael Wagener can't make John and Exene (or even Billy) sound commercial enough to convert anyone. On the first side he has trouble making them sound like anything at all.
"
FALSE,B,See How We Are,X,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8659,"
Even during the first four songs, when the sustained detail of the writing--with a boost from Dave Alvin's tormented yet unembittered ""4th of July""--makes it seems they'll fight for every inch, you miss Billy Zoom's syncretic junk: fine though he is, Tony Gilkyson is too neoclassy for these convinced vulgarians. Then the material devolves into complaints, throwaways, wasted stanzas, and utter clinkers.
"
FALSE,B,The Big Express,XTC,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8662,"
Remember when Difford &amp; Tilbrook were writing a musical? Sounds like a job for Partridge &amp; Moulding. They could name it after ""The Everyday Story of Smalltown."" Which would keep them working at the proper scale and be the best thing for steam-powered trains since Ray Davies.
"
FALSE,B,The Two of Us,Yarbrough & Peoples,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8664,"
The problem with received tropes about love and music isn't that they're a turnoff in themselves--finally, I don't care what the words of ""Don't Stop the Music"" are, and the same goes for ""Crazy"" and ""Third Degree,"" which continue side one. But when the settings are undistinguished, as on side two, only very great singers can attract one's interest the way a good lyric might. Y&amp;P are very good singers.

FALSE,B,You and Me Both,Yaz,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8666,"
Alf Moyet may not have as ""good"" a voice as Annie Lennox, but she's more fun to spend half an hour with--cut her and she bleeds, etc. A bit of an old romantic, though, which really isn't that much better than the new kind.

FALSE,B,Everybody Knows,Trisha Yearwood,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5809,"
Tricia had a dream, and by 1985 she was in Nashville pursuing it--studying ""music business,"" as her bio says, at Belmont College. An internship and some demo singing later, she had signed with MCA, where she now epitomizes the blandness of today's quality country. Not that she's bad or anything. Her voice is big and precise, and she ends up with a good song or two on every album--including this one, where she doesn't ruin strong titles by Kevin Welch and Steve Goodman and brings off a terrific Matraca Berg line about chocolate and magazines. But if songwriters love her so much, it must be because she brings nothing to the song but what they put there. The same cannot be said of Willie Nelson, George Jones, Reba McEntire, Garth Brooks--even Shania Twain. In pop music, good taste isn't timeless. It's boring.
"
FALSE,B,Fragile,Yes,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4240,"
I certainly prefer Yes's rock-classical synthesis--in which tricky intros, swooping dynamics, and intense textures are integrated into a self-sustaining (and -propelling) electric framework--to ELP's flashy chopsmanship. ""Round-About"" is a triumph right down to its nature-mystic lyric, the rhythm players each contribute a viable composition, Steve Howe remains a marvel, and even the rearranged Brahms from new keyboard player Rick Wakeman is tolerable. But isn't there supposed to be more to art than great contrivance?

As seems retrospectively inevitable in the neoclassicist era, a major finally gave this bluegrass-tinged hardshell a shot, expanding his generous indie EP of the same title (on Oak, if you care to look) into a skimpy album. Even first time around his twang-power purism was more retreat than reclamation. Add two superfluous covers, a duet with Maria McKee, and a title tune in which all those et ceteras turn out to be ""hillbilly music"" and you get Ricky Skaggs for sinners.

FALSE,B,Mighty Joe Young,Mighty Joe Young,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8186,"
If Young's voice weren't as gruffly workaday as his guitar, he might be a threat--he's got a knack for the blues subject, from mama-in-law to barbecue to what money can buy. Even with the stupid string synthesizer butting in, this is a solid, coverable groove album. And the Johnnie Taylor medley kicks it off naturally.

FALSE,B,Old Ways,Neil Young,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8669,"
In a pathetic attempt to convince the world he makes a difference in the record business, Warners touts this as his country move, but he doesn't and it's not. He's been making country moves ever since ""Oh Lonesome Me"" without once showing any flair for the literal narrative and pungent sentimentality the country audience goes for, though his modestly engaging melodies are the equal of any Music Row tunesmith's. So what you get when he's on is a catchy ditty that starts off like an utter clich������������������ but soon jogs a litt""Old Ways"" are divided into bad (substance abuse) and not so bad (workaholism). ""Are There Any More Real Cowboys?"" hails ""workin' families"" who resist encroaching developers, ""Bound for Glory""'s trucker abandons wife and kids for a hard-lovin' hitchhiker with new ideas and a dog.

FALSE,B,Life,Neil Young & Crazy Horse,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8670,"
The autobiography of a loose cannon starts things off with a bang, proving once and for all that this furriner should volunteer his literary services to the Central Intelligence Agency, where surrealistic inconsistency and casual racism are hallmarks of every cover story. Then there are the reflections on liberty (war?) and fashion (terrorism?) and a heroine from that bygone epoch when dusky-skinned peoples had natural nobility going for them. After which he turns the record over to riff on ""Too lonely to fall in love"" and toss off some mournful tunes and get his garage band to caterwaul ""That's why we don't want to be good."" Make no mistake, there's plenty of life left in the son of a bitch. Which should surprise no one who believes it.

FALSE,B,Colossal Youth,Young Marble Giants,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4253,"
What a modern romance--two brothers, a girl, and a rhythm machine. I'd call it cult music of the year, only cults inspire evangelical enthusiasm, and what their fans like is not getting excited about something--finally, after too much noise and three-chord thrash. With Alison Statton's fragile leads unthreatened by guitar, bass, organ, or rhythm machine, and Stuart Moxham's lyrics your basic Mensa applications, they're nothing more and nothing less than robot folkies. So call it cult muzak of the year--quiet, tuneful, passing weird.

FALSE,B,Waka/Jawaka--Hot Rats,Frank Zappa,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8193,"
With Sal Marquez playing ""many trumpets"" all over ""Big Swifty,"" there are times you could drop the needle and think you were listening to recent Miles Davis. That's certainly what Zappa's been doing. But where Davis is occasionally too loose, Zappa's always too tight--he seems to perceive only what is weird and alienating in his influences, never what is humane. Also, Sal Marquez doesn't play trumpet(s) as good as Miles.

FALSE,B,Bongo Fury,Frank Zappa/Captain Beefheart/The Mothers,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8198,"
This sentimental reunion album, recorded (where else?) in Austin with (what else?) additional L.A. studio work, is dismissed by Zappaphiles and 'Fhearthearts alike, but what were they expecting? Perhaps because there's a blues avatar up top, the jazzy music has a soulful integrity, and though it's embarrassing to hear the Captain deliver Frankie's latest pervo exploitations, the rest of the songs are funnier because he's singing them.

FALSE,B,Zvuki Mu,Zvuki Mu,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6212,"
Described by an admirer as ""a witty drunkard, wild dancer and failed poet,"" Peter Mamonov is also an old-fashioned beatnik, with woman problems to match: ""Yesterday you gave yourself to me/And now you think I owe you,"" ""just don't thrust yourself upon me with your endless meals."" These he recreates in a wild and witty way, complete with hypnotic cabaret-rock (or something). Like a lot of glasnost culture, he has his retro attractions--in his own language, the quarter-truths of his boho sexism give off a pleasant shock. But like a lot of beatniks, he can't resist experiments that aren't as avant-garde as he thinks they are.

FALSE,B,The Best of ZZ Top,ZZ Top,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8204,"
""10 Legendary Texas Tales,"" the cover claims, but that's another tall one. ""Jesus Just Left Chicago"" is more like it--these boys obviously believe that even sonsofgod get the blues. And by concentrating all their favorite steals in one place come up with a not-bad boogie album that can stand in for five lousy ones. High point: ""Tush"" (hey, I thought that was Jewish).
"
FALSE,B,Afterburner,ZZ Top,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8680,"
With sales on Eliminator over five mil almost by accident, this hard-boogieing market strategy is defined by conscious commercial ambition--by its all but announced intention of making ZZ the next Bruce/Madonna/Prince/Michael, with two beards and a Beard at every checkout counter. The Trevor Hornish synth touches and out-front hooks are clues, but the proof is ""Rough Boy,"" an attempted top-five ballad that would sound like pure take-me-or-leave-me revved up. And in case you think they've lost their sense of humor, there's a new dance called the ""Velcro Fly."" I'm laughing, I'm laughing.
