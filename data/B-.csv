FALSE,B-,How to Be a Zillionaire,ABC,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4281,"
The look of the Mark I ABC fooled Anglophobes into dismissing the music as fashion-plated pandering even though it was as politically suggestive as Anglophile heroes get. So don't let the look of the Mark II ABC fool you into hoping the music is outrageous, or even campy. Sure ""Be Near Me"" is catchier than anything on Beauty Stab, but when Martin Fry is on his game the hooks that make ABC sell coexist with the glossy electrofunk and dense wordplay that make (or made) them sparkle. As a great romantic he's just trying for a comeback.

FALSE,B-,Back in Black,AC/DC,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4285,"
Replacing Aerosmith as primitives of choice among admirers of heavy machinery, these Aussies are a little too archetypal for my tastes. Angus Young does come up with killer riffs, though not as consistently as a refined person like myself might hope, and fresh recruit Brian Johnson sings like there's a cattle prod at his scrotum, just the thing for fans who can't decide whether their newfound testosterone is agony or ecstasy. AC/DC can't decide either--""Shoot to Thrill,"" ""Given [sic] the Dog a Bone,"" and ""Let Me Put My Love Into You"" all concern the unimaginative sexual acts you'd imagine, and ""What Do You Do for Money Honey"" has a more limited set of answers than the average secretary would prefer. My sister's glad they don't write fantasy and science fiction, and if you're female you're free to share her relief. Brothers are more deeply implicated in these matters.

FALSE,B-,Live Live Juju,King Sunny Ade and His African Beats,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4294,"
Like so many live albums, it promises the real deal and then reduces an event that once engaged five or more senses to an aural abstraction. Worse, the percussive bias of both recording method and performance concept undercuts the momentum of the ensemble groove. Ruined by the Fallacy of the Drum Solo, in quadruplicate.

FALSE,B-,Get Your Wings,Aerosmith,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6284,"
These prognathous New Englanders are musicianly (all things are relative) inheritors of the Grand Funk principle: if a band is going to be dumb, it might as well be American dumb. Here they're loud and cunning enough to provide a real treat for the hearing-impaired, at least on side one. Have a sense of humor about themselves, too, assuming ""Lord of the Thighs"" is intended as a joke. With dumb bands it's always hard to tell.

FALSE,B-,Draw the Line,Aerosmith,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6286,"
The problem with the multiple-riff hi-test jobs that made Rocks rock was that when time came to follow up, the band was out of gas. The best of the three good ones here is a mold-breaking Joe-Perry-alone boogie that probably reflects the usual ""internal tensions."" Perry goes nowhere near the mold-breaking ""Kings and Queens,"" synthesized medieval pomp-rock (cf. Styx, Rush) that proves beyond doubt that they won't bite ""The Hand That Feeds."" We knew it all along, guys.

Four sides comprising seven titles--only two of them repeated (ad infinitum) from the band's studio albums--and they sure do boogie. But even if Duane Allman plus Dickey Betts does equal Jerry Garcia, the Dead know roads are for getting somewhere. That is, Garcia (not to bring in John Coltrane) always takes you someplace unexpected on a long solo. I guess the appeal here is the inevitability of it all.

Unable to resist the excessive eloquence of new producer Mitchell Froom and the slam-bang fills of new drummer Tim Mooney, or else in a really crummy mood, Doyen of Depression Mark Eitzel wallows in it. The much admired epitome is ""Apology for an Accident,"" where, among other things, he emotes the excellent lines ""I've been praying a lot lately/It's because I no longer have a TV"" as if nothing so horrible had ever befallen a drunk with too much time to kill. Unsurprisingly (although it was a bitter pill at first), ""What Godzilla Said to God When His Name Wasn't Found in the Book of Life"" isn't funny either. Oversinging and all, ""Johnny Mathis' Feet"" is. It's also the wisest thing on the record, which isn't to say it's wise in any absolute sense. That comes later, we hope--but don't necessarily expect.

FALSE,B-,Countrified,John Anderson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4311,"
What's made him the decade's premier country star artistically has been his disinclination to act like one--he's never climbed on the Nashville assembly line like Skaggs and Strait and so many smaller fry. Until now. He goes for George's intensity rather than Merle's hang-loose, but he won't convince you he thought these songs were special, and though this may mean the truth is still in him, don't bet on it--not after he yanked the difficult-to-program album he's got in the can. And just in case country radio isn't mollified, he provides a gratuitous cover of Merle's ""Fightin' Side of Me."" In the Vietnam era jingoistic trash at least made sense on its own neurotic terms. Who's he gonna beat up on in 1986? CISPES? Alexander Cockburn?

The noncommital title says a lot--about professionalism, about product. Not so much compromised as off his game, he kicks in with two winners and finishes off with a triumphant trope: ""There's a light at the end of the tunnel/And for once it ain't a fast moving train."" In between he goes all mushy about God, love, little children, born-to-losers, and the working man.

FALSE,B-,Friend or Foe,Adam Ant,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4317,"
Telescoping into a year and a half the kind of career that used to take a decade, Adam fires his group, hires some horns, and tops off his meretricious, arrogantly bombastic flop follow-up with some ruminations on life's little ups and downs. The first surprise is that four of these are arrogantly catchy. The second surprise is that all four dwell--allusively in the title tune--on Adam's status as victim-of-the-press, a theme that was death to rock and roll in a less self-conscious age. Still has trouble with real life, though, which is probably why the rest bombs.

Whose voice touches who is personal, but that doesn't mean Antony will ever reach as many humans as Aretha Franklin or Billie Holiday, and up against the archer Bryan Ferry, the artier Rufus Wainwright, and the grander Nina Simone, objective physical differences manifest themselves: he's thinner, drier, more strained. Not only is his willingness to express emotion commoner than indie denizens imagine, his failure to undercut that emotion with irony or humor is a spiritual weakness. Right, he suffers. But billions of humans have it worse, and while we who are luckier are morally obliged to remember that, we're not obliged to empathize with any of them. Those convinced of the metaphoric-political centrality of transgender issues and the AIDS epidemic will feel Antony's songs. Those who don't should find a record they enjoy.

""Veering between an eerie beauty and an almost nightmarish desolation,"" intoneth Frank Owen. ""Imbuing machine music with spirituality,"" saith Simon Reynolds. And, most incredibly, ""Always a groove going on,"" quoth J.D. Considine. I mean, what are these dudes talking about? Not that ambient-techno wunderkind Richard James is offensive--when I played all two-and-a-half hours of this at a quiet thermal spring in Puerto Rico, the worst any of the attendant pensioners could say about James's nightmarish desolation was ""interesting."" And smack dab against Eno's instrumental box--well, if James really gets ""physically ill if [his] music sounds like anybody else's,"" that's one consumer object he'd best not sully his expanded consciousness with. Thing is, James is rarely as rich as good Eno, not to mention good Eno-Hassell or Eno-Budd. One piece here does the trick (no titles or track listings--too Western, y'know--but it is, how crass, the lead cut) by folding in a child's voice (or is that one of his electronic friends?). In general, however, these experiments are considerably thinner (""purer,"" Owen wishes) and more static (""pulse dreamily,"" Considine dreams) than the overpriced juvenilia on the import-only Volume I. Anyway, a lot of Eno's ""ambient"" music could also be described as bland wallpaper. When Kyle Gann or (please God) Tom Johnson pumps a minimalist, I wonder whether I'm missing something. Otherwise I believe my own ears--and pull out David Berhman's On the Other Ocean/Music From a Clearing when I need deep background.

Not your average record, since some of it is bloody awful. But at its best--the title tune, with its gently shuddering guitar line, and ""Ballad of the Remo Four,"" a lament for the group's long-lost pre-Beatle Liverpool days that sounds like the best of Doug Sahm and Boz Scaggs in one cut--it's bloody terrific.

A lot of conceptual work went into the choice of material here. But what's made the Wheel's records come across have been new Ray Benson and Leroy Preston songs that played off and framed the borrowings and rediscoveries.

FALSE,B-,Crucial Tracks,Aswad,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4341,"
Where their opposite numbers in Steel Pulse yoke reggae militance to rock aggression, they soften reggae hope with pop salesmanship. Singing sweeter and smarmier than Gregory Isaacs if not Billy Ocean, Brinsley Forde doesn't lend much force to lyrics like ""Set Them Free"" and ""Back to Africa."" Nor does their obvious eagerness to insert cutesy hooks do much for their aura of righteousness. Like so many black pop best-ofs, this one showcases beautiful music--I dig their dabs of dub. But if Lionel Richie came up with a liberal lie on the order of ""Give a Little Love""--""Only we can make it better/Only if we try""--reggae fans would cry Babylon from here to Nostrand Avenue.

Now it's official: Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach were the best things ever to happen to each other. She's a bore without him, and he brings out the best in none of the other singers here. If anything, his fancy hackwork diminishes them-whether it's starters like the Drifters, the Shirelles, and Dusty Springfield or second-stringers like Gene Pitney, Jackie DeShannon, and end-of-the-bencher Chuck Jackson, all sound about as good as you'd expect and all peaked elsewhere. Then there are Lou Johnson, B.J. Thomas, Bobby Vinton, and the hapless Bacharach himself, not to mention horrid one-shots by Richard Chamberlain, Bobby Goldsboro, Trini Lopez, Jill O'Hara, gad. It's enough to renew your faith in Elvis Costello.

FALSE,B-,I Against I,Bad Brains,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=226,"
As a reggae band, they were a hardcore band with a change-up; as a metal band, they're a hardcore band with a great windup and no follow-through. The small problem is H.R.'s lyrics, which he's still smart enough to blur with the speed and attitude that make the lead and title cut their strongest song since ""Pay to Cum."" The big problem is Dr. Know, who's got a hundred Hendrix moves and no killer riffs.

FALSE,B-,Bad Co.,Bad Company,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6339,"
Since a strong singer (Paul Rodgers, who's letting the hair on his chest grow out) usually dominates a strong guitarist (Mike Ralphs, who's devoting himself to Paul Kossoff impressions anyway), this is less Mott the Hoople without pretensions (which are missed) than Free poppified (but not enough, hit single or no hit single).

FALSE,B-,Straight Shooter,Bad Company,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6340,"
This rocks even more consistently than Bad Co., but to argue that it epitomizes hard rock as a style is not only to overlook its deliberate speed but to believe in one's (usually male) heart that Paul Rodgers is the ideal rock singer. You hear that a lot; what it seems to mean is that he doesn't shriek when he gets to the loud parts. Rodgers's power is no more interesting than Tom Jones's, and Jones is twice as subtle. If hard rock doesn't have more to offer, it's not worth arguing about.

Almost imperceptibly, album by album, they soften their Free-derived formalism--not only does this one include ten (why, that's almost eleven!) different tunes, but the dynamics shift and the tempos accelerate slightly and Paul Rodgers actually sounds a little soulful. Which needless to say is a mixed blessing. It's not just that the lyrics are dumb, although there are smarter ways of being dumb than this, but that Rodgers emotes these egregious hip-and-funky clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s as if he's never run across such sentiments before in his life.

Once again I'm forced to wonder whether I wouldn't like this record if it were by the Beatles. But without mentioning what the question says about the group, which is called Badfinger, the answer is that the Beatles couldn't have made this record. Except for ""Day After Day"" and ""Perfection,"" not one of these unabashedly tuneful tunes has any magic to it, which isn't simply a matter of cautious tempos and harmonies--it's a matter of magic. Nor will any of them add any phrases verbal or musical to our common language, although they might keep a few in circulation. Also, the Beatles put nicer pictures on the cover--pictures of themselves.

Having listened far more than natural inclination dictated, I've become actively annoyed with this vocal watershed. From its strong lounge-jazz beat to its conscious avoidance of distracting lyrical detail, it's all husky, burnished mood, the fulfillment of the quiet-storm format black radio devised to lure staider customers away from white-bread temptations like soft rock and easy listening. God knows it's more soulful, and sexier, too, but that's all it is--a reification of the human voice as vehicle of an expression purer than expression ever ought to be.

Three excellent songs on one side from this Austin-based unit--a New Orleans shuffle with country-rock vocal, a Jamaican polka, and a remake of the theme from Busby Berkeley's 42nd Street.

In some pop convolution, the effectlessness with which these London lasses appropriate various attractive girlgroup epiphenomena may simply signify that they're not an ""authentic"" girl group.

Her vocal intensity seems passionate when you're in the mood and affected when you're not. Her love songs are as desperate, committed, and possessed as her political ones.

Just when I'd made my peace with pop prog and begun to hope arty prog would prove another casualty of the age of digital instantaneity, these postrock warriors get the bright idea of adding tune and humor to their higher mathematics. Just goes to show how hard up some aesthetes are for the hooks and jokes that are still so plentiful in less rarefied precincts. Swing less than Jeff Beck, Dixie Dregs or Big Lazy, rock more than Gentle Giant, Love Tractor or Tortoise.

Except for the sophomoric ""Student Demonstration Time,"" the songs on the first side are all right--""Take a Load Off Your Feet"" is worthy of Wild Honey and ""Disney Girls (1957)"" is worthy of Jack Jones's Greatest Hits--but the pop impressionism of side two drags hither and yon. The dying words of a tree are delivered in an apt, gentle croak, but the legendary title opus is an utter failure even on its own woozy terms and there are several disasters from the guest lyricists--Van Dyke Parks's wacked-out meandering is no better than Jack Rieley's.

As with any pop band, catchy tunelets aren't enough: what the tunelets say, how they sound, and what how they sound says also matter.

The best-of sounds like Roxy Music gone heavy art-rock and makes a case for their cult reputation. Bill Nelson's guitar tone is pretty remarkable--thick yet ductile, by Phil Manzanera out of Randy California--and here he makes up for empty-headed improvisations with a career's worth of ID riffs.

Never before have I been fully convinced that Beck could improvise long lines, or jazz it up with a modicum of delicacy, or for that matter get funky. But he still has absolutely nothing to say. It's not that he's jettisoned the vocalist--lots of jazzmen say plenty without words. It's that he's a technician and nothing more, making music guaranteed to excite only one group of listeners--those who respond to complaints about content the way atheists respond to visions of the Most High.

Michael Brown (the Left Banke, Stories) keeps getting better. The weld between his snazzy European colors and textures and the concise, kinetic pop structures of his American rock and roll is by now totally invisible, and the playing is energetic and expert.

I admire the perverse riskiness of this music, which neglects disco bounce in favor of demented falsetto abstraction, less love-man than newborn-kitten. And I'm genuinely fond of many small moments of madness here, like the way the three separate multitracked voices echo the phrase ""living together.""

I like it so much, in fact, that I find the 4:10 single version a little scant--not enough strings, fancy that--and I'm sorry to report that the specially mixed disco disc is a promotion only item.

His style has always been undeniable, but not irresistible--cf. Bio.

Because he sang both their pop hits, Mick was always slotted as the Clash's loverboy, but that was just his vocal cross to bear--he was really the intellectual, which is why he now specializes in what the handout calls ""humor particularly irony."" Though ""A Party"" and ""The Bottom Line"" are wordy enough for Ellen Foley, their anger would surface instantly if Joe were spitting them out. He might even make something of the Nippophobic ""Sony"" and the loverboy's lament ""Stone Thames."" But as it is, only ""E = MC2,"" laid down across cosmic keyb chords, lives up to Jones's goofily internationalist spirit.

Nothing wrong with mixing up a blues-based mush of Stones and Faces and Allmans and whoever, especially when you come by your influences naturally and don't imitate any of them. So of course these youngsters are ""original"" enough. What they're not is good enough. After all, the Faces and the Allmans weren't such hot songwriters either, and their heirs don't exactly have a Young Rod or a Gregg-and-Dickey to compensate. With seven of Southern Harmony's 10 live-in-the-studio cuts going on longer than 17 of Exile on Main Street's thick-mixed 18, call them the new Humble Pie and put out a search on DFX2's Emotion. Now there was a Stones rip.

""Refusing to preach about politics, guns and bitches,"" as one admirer puts it (""Thankfully there's no inkling of misogyny or homophobia--how refreshing!""), these well-meaners are the Jurassic Five's answer to Arrested Development. Proficient, bland, and dauntingly dull, their only threat is a promise to ""take it back to the days of Mantronix"" (no, please, anything but that). I can only guess why they clock corporate cash while accessible and manifestly civilized West Coast alt-rap megatalents like Lyrics Born, Del, and Aceyalone explore bootstrap entrepreneurship. Maybe they lucked into connected management. Maybe they take good meeting. Or maybe their very lack of content has the advantage of cosseting the commercial preconceptions that count for so much more with sellers than buyers.

Depleted by the kind of corporate strife I thought these guys were too cynical to fall for (which may be why they did), Henry Rollins's adrenalin gives out. The consequent depression is so monumental that even Greg Ginn succumbs, adding only one classic to his catalogue of noise solos (""The Swinging Man"") and grinding out brain-damaged cousins of luded power chords behind the three dirges that waste side two. But things do start off manically enough, with the title tune (refrain: ""You're one of them"") and five minutes of Henry explaining why he smiles so much (which I never noticed).

As he'll be happy to tell you if only you ask and probably even if you don't--at great length, all the gory details, plenty of asides, with bells on--Larry Kirwan has been around. The Major Thinkers, Turner &amp; Kirwan of Wexford, God knows and I've forgotten what and who else--failure after failure, always with Kirwan struggling against the injustice of his continued obscurity. And though he's finally landed a major-label contract and three pounds of clippings, he's still struggling, for in truth now, Black 47 hasn't exactly eaten SoundScan for breakfast. Kirwan has plenty of brains and the gift of gab, but he's always overdone it, and these 16 songs last 70 minutes, the better to undergird their hefty arrangements--guitar-bass-drums, pipes and whistles, horn section, arena-jig beat, colleens, gad. Worst of all are Kirwan's vocals, soul-as-melodrama rockism with a brogue. The Irish immigrant underground is a great subject, and Kirwan knows its stories even if he overdoes those too. Maybe some laconic guy with an acoustic guitar will cover a few when the smoke clears.

He wrote them, all right, but only once--on an amazing ""All Shook Up"" that ranks with Presley's--does the singer in him manage to reclaim what was long ago appropriated from the composer.

Elsewhere power pop turns power cabaret and Sgt. Pepper turns white album, only without Lennon-McCartney, or even McCartney.

I didn't like them initially because I was under the impression they were a ""group""--a musical aggregation--when in fact they're a comedy troupe who play instruments. Explaining why I don't like (i.e., laugh at) them in retrospect is harder--responses to comedy are even more personal than responses to music. Just say that what they do strikes me as boarding-school humor--covertly classbound escapist silliness without Monty Python's moral underpinnings. This generous two-disc compilation, an hour and forty minutes of entertainment in all, is intelligent and imaginative. But it's also narrow for the worst reasons.

This is a failure. The tunes make (Lennon-McCartney's) ""Across the Universe"" sound like a melodic highlight, and although the amalgam of English hard rock and Philly soul is so thin it's interesting, it often overwhelms David's voice, which is even thinner. But after the total alienation of Diamond Dogs and the total ripoff of David Live, I'm pleased with Bowie's renewed generosity of spirit--he takes pains to simulate compassion and risks failure simply by moving on. His reward is two successes: the title tune, in which pain stimulates compassion, and (Bowie-Lennon-Alomar's) ""Fame,"" which rhymes with pain and makes you believe it.

It isn't music that makes Bragg so much fun live, so I'm not surprised that the songs are as flat here as in their studio versions--especially since some of them are studio versions.

The black musician with the unforgettable name sings like the bluesman he's thought to be, but though he plays some blues, too, more often he picks like a Nashville cat.

Only two hits on this studio double, though it takes Hank Ballard five minutes to describe its riches on side two--""he comes from all sides on this one."" Lines repeat from song to song--""The long-haired hippies and the Afro blacks/All get together off behind the tracks/And they party""--and so do riffs. The hook on the twelve-minute ""Please, Please"" (not to be confused, of course, with ""Please, Please, Please"") repeats one hundred forty-eight (and a half) times. I love the hook, I even like the line, and if this were the world's only James Brown album it would be priceless.

It's not horrible, but I'd just as soon hear the competition--after all, what's JB without intensity?

""I'm Black, I'm Back?"" is how JB begins the commercial message on the jacket, and the title track is his biggest single in a year and a half. ""I can see the disco now,"" he emphasizes, and even the blues and the ballad cultivate a groove designed to reintroduce him to that alien world he founded. But he sounds defensive because he has a reason to be--he can't hit the soft grooves the way he can the hard ones. When he starts equating himself with Elvis Presley (just before the fade on ""I Refuse to Lose""), you know the identity problems are getting critical.

They're getting longer, too; the eight songs here average over five minutes. I admit that the longest is also the best, an intricate extended metaphor called ""Fountain of Sorrow.""

It's so late she stays over, and I watch her sleep, you know? God. But she wakes up pretty early and we kiss goodbye and she gets in the car and then what do you think happens? The U-Haul breaks free and there's dishes all over the road. It seemed awful at the time, the mess and the delay had me stressing, but I gotta laugh about it now. And you know the funniest part? Without her noticing I kept some of those dishes--you're eating your pizza off one right now. More oregano?'' Well, that's how I'd replot the best song here--in Buckner's version it's ditches all over the road, and he still thinks the whole thing was awful.

My friend from New Haven says, ""Except for `17 Years on Your River,' I don't think I'd like this record if I weren't from New Haven."" Exactly. This is the kind of testament every loyal local group ought to leave, with a few excellent songs (I also like ""Living in the Country"") and lots of memories for all the folks it's entertained. Unfortunately, few local groups ever reach this level of competence, but in any case the economics of the music industry discourage such moderate success--if your appeal isn't big-time, you're lucky to record at all, and if it is, chances are even or better that you're working a dumb variation on somebody else's gimmick.

With Pat Place slash-sliding away and Cynthia Sley OK to be in the same room with, the postliberated axe-women of Emma Goldman's (Zelda Fitzgerald's?) version of the Contortions were an up on chutzpah alone. A pioneering rhythm-and-paranoia band, their ""Too Many Creeps""/""Snakes Crawl""/""You Taste Like the Tropics"" summed up the Lower East Side circa 1980.

FALSE,B-,Sometimes I Just Feel Like Smilin',The Butterfield Blues Band,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6521,"
Proving once again that artists who make records you admire but never play often end up making records you're not so sure you admire. These days this is a blues band only in the broadest sense--Butterfield sings infrequently if well, some if not all of the arrangements sound like Stan Kenton believing himself superior to B.B. King, and the female chorus must have wandered in from the next studio.
"
FALSE,B-,Put It in Your Ear,Paul Butterfield,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6525,"
The modishly far-out rhythms and textures here are so authentic they recall Jimmy Witherspoon or Bobby Bland casting desperately about for a hit. The bluesman fluffs one ballad and sounds a little strange doing romantic patter, and producer Henry Glover has for some reason set his own ""Breadline"" amid enough instruments to feed a family of four for six months, but once you conquer your suspicion that this is a disaster it sounds pretty good. I don't hear any hits, though.

I respect these guys, really--their dedication to dementia is a rare and wondrous thing. But their claque's idea of accessibility is Iron Butterfly on bad acid digging deconstruction, yet another version of the touching avant-garde truism which holds that the proper study of incoherence is incoherent. Upped a notch or two for concept, attitude, hype, bullshit, somewhere in there.

FALSE,B-,Younger Than Yesterday,The Byrds,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10985,"
The Byrds' Greatest Hits, a profit-taking retrospective from later in the year, sounds like a triumph of produced and programmed rock and roll, while The Notorious Byrd Brothers and Sweetheart of the Rodeo, which followed it in '68, are two of the most convincing arguments for artistic freedom ever to come out of American rock. But this April '67 failure suffers from two related '67 maladies: pretentiousness and self-expression. David Crosby's ""Mind Garden"" is a completely unlistenable acid meander, while four (three too many) innocuous folk-rock cum countryrock tunes by Chris Hillman are a familiar-sounding example of how an uninteresting self does its number. Never before did concept-master Roger (nï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Jim) McGuinn efface himself so disa"

Two good white gospel (a fundamentalist and a modernist) plus one good Roger McGuinn song (out of four, and he needed a collaborator) plus one good Skip Battin song (he needed a collaborator too--Kim Fowley). In sum, better than Farther Along, but if you can only tell arithmetically how much difference can it make?

FALSE,B-,Okie,J.J. Cale,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6534,"
For J.J., this is adventurous stuff--""I Got the Same Old Blues"" states his world view (you don't have to listen, just read the title), ""Starbound"" adapts his style to some (awful) space pop, and ""The Old Man and Me"" introduces a character whom he isn't making it with (at least he doesn't mention it).

FALSE,B-,Feel Me,Cameo,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4496,"
Incredibly, or do I mean accidentally, their sixth album in four years on the production line is a discernible improvement, and not because the hits (or lyric sheet) are necessary. It's all groove and sound: drummer/leader shows off like bosses do, Moog man's old-fashioned Walter Carlos gurgles fit da funk like they ruined der Bach, and the slow ones are down to two, one a bow to the Spinners.

FALSE,B-,Soon Over Babaluma,Can,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5930,"
A basically instrumental excursion that aficionados rank with the sprawling Tago Mago, this 1974 Kraut-rock opus is to the Miles Davis of the era as acid jazz is to real jazz. It's never pompous, discernibly smart, playful, even goofy. If you give it your all you can make out a few shards of internal logic. But the light tone avoids texture, density, or pain. The jazzy pulse is innocent of swing, funk, or sex. And if it generates any intrinsic interest, as opposed to the conceptual kick of being so singularly European, after half a dozen plays I should have some inkling what that interest is.
"
FALSE,B-,Hallelujah,Canned Heat,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10834,"
The best Canned Heat lp solely because it contains four (of 11) cuts by Alan Wilson, who has one of the great freak voices and writes songs to match. As usual, it is dominated by Bob ""Rastus"" Hite, who must have been responsible for Rolling Stone's suggestion that the next Canned Heat album be called ""Yassuh Boss."" He is most offensive on one of those ""introducing the band"" jams (""Henry shoah does have the feelin', yeah"") and on another exercise in solipsism called ""Canned Heat."" I am sure I only forgive him his version of Fats Domino's ""Big Fat"" because I don't happen to know the original. Still, Wilson's talent is too peculiar to fill an album. I wonder what should be done with him.

I've always suspected that underneath the naive surrealism the Captain might be a dumbbell, and now that he's really (really really) trying to go commercial he's providing proof. This time he really (really) does it--writes dumb little songs with dumb little lyrics and dumb little hooks. Maybe all the dumb dumb parts can be blamed on svengali and cocomposer Andy DiMartino. And I admit that a lot of these are passable (""Magic Be"") to wonderful (""Sugar Bowl"") dumb little songs. But they're still dumb. Really.

FALSE,B-,Bluejeans and Moonbeams,Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6544,"
Supposedly, this album consists of outtakes from Cap's previous Andy DiMartino LP, but if anything I prefer it. ""Party of Special Things to Do"" (mama told him not to come) and ""Observatory Crest"" (Beefheart's first make-out song) surround his cover of ""Same Old Blues"" so cunningly that after a while you start to forget J.J. Cale, and before you know it you're at the funky harmonica features that closes side one.

FALSE,B-,Butterfly Kisses (Shades of Grace),Bob Carlisle,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6230,"
I don't hate the single like I'm supposed to--I think it's healthy for Christians to acknowledge the erotic subtext of parental love, and anyway, I choke up a little when she gets married (stop smirking unless you have a pubescent daughter). I note that as pop oversingers go he's on the human side of Celine and Hanson. And I like the professed humility of lines like, ""I'm not tryin' to preach to ya/and tell you that I've found all the easy answers/when half the time I can't even find my keys."" But the problem isn't just that this promise keeper is lying--music is his ministry, and damn straight he uses it to preach. It's that only on his fluke hit does he have the grace to universalize his beliefs even as much as Kirk Franklin, who makes his song about ""mustard seed faith"" signify even though it's far more God-proud. Carlisle is a niche evangelist, addressing the men's-movement generation of alienated suburban husbands, white and Protestant assumed. He's pretty good at it. But he's so short on true proselytizing zeal that no one else will give a shit once his smash crashes.

Why do I believe this Nashville liberal showers three times a day and doesn't think sex is the right place to get your face wet? Is it the Stones riff that marches by as neatly as the quaint mandolin-and-harpsichord figure? The voice that never doubts its own clarity? Creative writing like ""The sepia tones of a lost afternoon/Cradle a curio storefront""? As dull as Al Gore and Ralph Nader put together.

That a ""dumb"" purveyor of Farfisa retro should transform his Chicago joke into anti-imperialist militance didn't flabbergast smart hedonism fans--only that he then produced effective anti-imperialist songs in his hedonistic silly-detail mode. And that he fails to do the same with slogans and a ""better"" band comes as no surprise at all.

The problem's not immersion in formula. The problem's not exhaustion of formula. The problem's boredom with formula. This is longer, slower, and denser as well as older, with lyrics that skirt social commentary and music that essays textural pretension. Its peaks are ""Touch and Go"" and ""Up and Down."" Savor the rhythm of those phrases, Ric, and grow no more.

FALSE,B-,Castles of Ghana,John Carter,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10310,"
This ain't jazz, it's modern chamber music, quite European in view of its ostensible subject, which is how Afro-European mercantilism became the slave trade. In the modern European manner, its real subject is itself--explorations of color and texture that are worth tagging along on occasionally, but best left to the specialists and their grant money most of the time.

FALSE,B-,Johnny Cash at San Quentin,Johnny Cash,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10835,"
Much inferior to Folsom Prison and Greatest Hits, which is where to start if you're just getting into Cash. Contains only nine songs, one of which is performed twice. Another was written by Bob Dylan.
"
FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits Volume 3,Johnny Cash,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6552,"
In 1968, his marriage to June Carter and his Folsom Prison album made Cash look like the greatest artist in country music, but who today would think of ranking him with George Jones, Willie Nelson, or Merle Haggard? A diminished singer, writer, and public presence, he hasn't even put together enough singles for a worthwhile best-of. Here are two duets with Waylon and one with June, two decent love songs by others and three flabby ones by himself, and you know what you'll remember next day? ""Oney"" and ""One Piece at a Time,"" both about working the assembly line. Somehow I don't expect him to take the hint.
"
FALSE,B-,Rockabilly Blues,Johnny Cash,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4514,"
Merely by copping to the magic concept ""rockabilly,"" Cash can kick up comeback talk. And comparison with his rockabilly rockabilly for Sun (where he was always the countriest) establishes that by the standards of an ordinary mortal he's a better singer now--more flexible physically, more expressive emotionally. But the technique is a cover for what's lost, probably forever--stolid depth as immovable presence. Same goes for the arrangements--defiantly understated for Nashville, they're customized rock-country up against the austerities of the Tennessee Two. In other words, an honorable country album with some pretty good songs on it.

Survivors of what, pray tell. Oh--of whom. We get it. We know you all were trying, too--especially Big Jawn, whose concert it was. So we regret to inform you that you sound dissipated anyway, which has an odd effect on the gospel tunes and makes for the most magnificently thrown-away ""Whole Lotta Shakin'"" of Jerry Lee's intensely nonchalant career.

These Southern brothers relate to soul rather than boogie, with a nice gain in structure, but they could use some surface flash to highlight all that sincerity, which is a lot more profound in the vocalization than the verbalization in any case.

The reason the Time Peace best-of is the Rascals album to own is the reason this runs down a groove so pleasant you often forget it's there. It's on a par with The Island of Real, maybe. But not Search and Nearness.

Boy, has this shit dated--it's worn as thin as the sidemen's professionalism and James's embouchure. And the titles go beyond petty candor into keep-your-self-to-yourself-please--a ""White Cannibal"" with ""Money to Burn"" and (give this boy a benefit) ""Sophisticated Cancer""? Sure it's nice to hear ""King Heroin"" covered with so much soul. But when he opens with ""I Feel Good, I Got You"" he's lying three ways.

Beyond thrilling to ""Bang Bang Bang"" and the inescapable ""Fast Car,"" my only felt insight into Chapman's aura came at a Nelson Mandela tribute where her voice filled the venue, which happened to be Yankee Stadium. Maybe it's a positive that her recordings never convey that kind of size--means she's more modest than her foremothers, Joan Baez and Odetta. But what's left is a joylessly self-sufficient gravity that makes her ""heaven's here on earth"" sound a lot more pro forma, not to say phonier, than her ""The whole world's broke/And it ain't worth fixing.""

What a letdown. With covers that range from silly (is that Jack ""Riding Thumb,"" after he hits the road?) to obvious (""We Had It All"" is quintessentially Charles country adequately rendered), and with a filler from his publishing subsidiary at a redundant nadir, the same old horn charts and obligatory big productions really begin to grate. Ray doesn't hit his stride until the last five words--one word, really--of the final cut, which is about poor people and addressed to the president: ""Can you dig it? Amen.""

The second side almost works as a best-of, but I'd wait for the studio job--despite the Japanese applause track, this was obviously recorded in the Big Room at Carlsbad Caverns. Arrangements are gratifyingly tight--ten titles on a single disc--but six of them are also available (even tighter) on In Color. Also: ""Ain't That a Shame,"" the intro of which ought to give pause to those who consider Rick Nielsen an innovative guitar player as opposed to showman; a throwaway collaboration with Tom Petersson; a nice Move ripoff; and ""Surrender.""
"
FALSE,B-,Dream Police,Cheap Trick,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6569,"
What's always saved this band for me was the jokes, but this time they're just not in the grooves, and there's only so much you can do with funny hats on the cover. A good heavy metal band, sure--be thankful for the fast tempos. But probably not a great heavy metal band. And you know what happens to good heavy metal bands long about the fifth album.
"
FALSE,B-,Desireless,Eagle-Eye Cherry,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5045,"
Watch out for this mild-mannered simp: underneath his lite croon, refabricated truisms, and avant-garde pedigree, he's got the tunes. The title track, an instrumental-with-chant composed by his trumpeter dad, points up how flimsy they are.
"

I wonder about the They Shoot Horses reference--that is where ""yowsah yowsah yowsah"" was popularized, after all. Is this chic as anti-Depression concept? Dance as desperation? Dance as survival? Or just useful noise?
"
FALSE,B-,The Lost EP,The Chills,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4530,"
Recorded '84-'85, two years before Brave Worls, and it sounds it. First side you wonder why the songs aren't quite there--maybe it's you. Second side crumbles the quandry with ""Whole Weird World"" (""Nearly there . . . nearly,"" they claim) and the four-part (suite?) ""Dream by Dream."" Neither title is sufficiently ironic. Not juvenilia--they'd already been around four or five years. But only New Zealanders would guess.

FALSE,B-,E.C. Was Here,Eric Clapton,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10809,"
From Clapton a live album is welcome these days. At the very least it guarantees that his head was higher than his feet at time of recording, and live albums being what they are it also assures plenty of what he does best, which is play guitar. But though Clapton's choked lyricism can be exciting, he does have trouble breaking loose, and because George Terry's sound is so like his own their colloquies don't spark much. Besides, this is basically a blues album--four of the six cuts fit the category with varying degrees of authenticity--and I expect a blues album to be sung as well as played.
"
FALSE,B-,No Reason to Cry,Eric Clapton,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6583,"
A well-made, rather likable rock and roll LP that shows more pride and joy than the standard El Lay studio product, probably because the characters here assembled don't do this kind of thing all that much. The words are trite but the singing is eloquent and the instrumental signature an almost irresistible pleasure. But what does it all mean?
"
FALSE,B-,Backless,Eric Clapton,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6585,"
Whatever Eric isn't anymore--guitar genius, secret auteur, humanitarian, God--he's certainly king of the Tulsa sound, and here he contributes three new sleepy-time classics. All are listed on the cover sticker and none were written by Bob Dylan. One more and this would be creditable.

FALSE,B-,Journeyman,Eric Clapton,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4545,"
What did you expect him to call it--Hack? Layla and 461 Ocean Boulevard were clearly flukes: he has no record-making knack. So he farms out the songs, sings them competently enough, and marks them with his guitar. Which sounds kind of like Mark Knopfler's.

FALSE,B-,Unplugged,Eric Clapton,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6083,"
Laid-back doesn't equal dead--461 Ocean Boulevard is laid-back. What's wrong with this stopgap is it means to be inoffensive. Relegating Clapton-the-electric-guitarist to the mists of memory and capturing Clapton-the-pop-vocalist in a staid mood only an adrenaline junkie could confuse with the sly somnolence of ""I Shot the Sherriff"" and ""Willie and the Hand Jive,"" it turns ""Layla"" into a whispery greeting card. No wonder the pop star he most closely resembles on television is James Galway.

FALSE,B-,Breakaway,Kelly Clarkson,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13094,"
Unlike young Hilary Duff, 23-year-old Clarkson feels the responsibilities of stardom, which demand melodramatic overkill. The doctors give her stronger pills than, say, Clay Aiken--the prefab kissoff of ""Walk Away,"" the new wave heartbreak of ""Since U Been Gone,"" ""Because of You"" may just describe an occurrence, here's the verb ""implode,"" and ""There's no light at the end of the tunnel/Just a bridge that I gotta burn"" could hold up its end of a bargain. None of these survives Clarkson's larger-than-life ambitions or compressed-to-oppress production regimen. But she may have a heart, and it may end up in the right place.

I found this tremendously disappointing at first--not one song I could hang my head on. But the political analysis is at the very least sensible, no common thing in popular music, Cliff's singing is earnest and spirited enough to give the analysis some immediacy. And in a few cases--""Born to Win,"" ""The Price of Peace,"" and especially ""Under the Sun, Moon and Stars,"" about his parents--it isn't just the message that puts the tune across.

Cliff hasn't evinced this much interest in years, and his female backup sounds as sisterly as Bob Marley's. But any artist whose most specific songs concern spiritual deliverance--talkin' 'bout ""Bongo Man"" and, yep, ""Universal Love""--isn't out of the ether yet.

Who said nobody makes fun rock and roll any more? Who said it's almost impossible to find simple rock and roll lyrics that aren't merely inane? Who said all the tasty countrified guitar licks and tasty funkified drum licks have disappeared amid the hooks, saccharin, and fustian? And who cares?

In the unlikely event that you both don't know and care, I'll note that this is the follow-up cum answer record to 1986's biggest one-shot, Club Vieux's ""Rumors."" The auteur is rejected Club Vieux svengali Jay King, who proves which half of the one-shot had the professionalism by turning in a listenable as opposed to barely competent album.

Occasionally he hits a phrase that merits its aura of heightened significance: coming at the climax (not end) of ""Guerilla Betrayed,"" the line ""I'd like to put a bullet through the world"" says it all.

The bad music here can't be blamed on Phil Spector's melodies--Cohen has never posed as a particularly tuneful guy himself. And the main thing wrong with Spector's settings, banal though they are, is that they lack doors. Ordinarily, Cohen whispers, murmurs, whines, croaks, and even screams through the music. Here he has to try and sing over it, using more or less normal volume and timbre.

As an exemplary undergraduate he had his place in the great chain of being, but as a perpetual grad student he needs ID. (Maybe also a better rhythm section.) On this compilation, with two B sides for bait (and four accredited Rattlesnakes tracks for quality), he applies for his card. I wouldn't put it past college radio to give it to him.

One thing you know about a funk band that goes number one with something as sappy as ""Three Times a Lady""--they ain't as funky as they used to be. Or maybe they were never really a funk band to begin with--just potential pros who understood funk's entertainment potential the way John Denver understood folk music's. If they perceive any inflammatory potential in rhythm per se, they do what they can to dampen the fire. I love ""Brick House,"" ""Machine Gun,"" and ""Slippery When Wet,"" but they're not even on the same side of this depressing compilation, half of which is devoted to Lionel Richie and his mealy mouth.

Before deciding whether you really want the new Ry Cooder album, try an easier question--do you really want the new Manuel Galbï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n album? That is, the solo debut""great"" (I keep reading but not hearing) old Cuban doowop group Los Zafiros. Unless you're one of those guys who keeps up with Dick Dale, probably not. Which clears up the Ry question without even referencing clunky drummer Joachim Cooder, who should never be allowed to back one of his father's discoveries again for as long as he lives.

FALSE,B-,Love It to Death,Alice Cooper,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6624,"
Never would have figured this theatre type to come up with it, but he did--""I'm Eighteen,"" as archetypal a hard rock single as you're liable to hear in this flaccid year, or maybe ever. Almost as surprising, guitarist Mike Bruce surrounds it with the anthemic ""Caught in a Dream"" and ""Long Way to Go."" After which drummer Dennis Dunaway gives forth with ""Black Juju,"" which lasts four seconds longer than all three of the above combined.
"
FALSE,B-,Killer,Alice Cooper,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6625,"
A taste for the base usages of hard rock rarely comes with a hit attached these days, much less ""surreal,"" ""theatrical,"" and let us not forget ""transvestite"" trappings, which is why some desperate rock and rollers have convinced themselves their prayers are being answered. But while this is the band's most song-oriented LP, it falters after ""Under My Wheels"" and ""Be My Lover,"" neither of them an ""I'm Eighteen"" in the human outreach department. And only one of the three ""theatrical"" extravaganzas, ""Dead Babies,"" works on record (never mind in the theatre).
"
FALSE,B-,School's Out,Alice Cooper,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6626,"
With its all-time ugly vocal, kiddie chorus turned synthesizer, and crazy, dropped-out thrust, the title hit is as raw and clever as it gets, but this album is soundtrack. Some of it's even copped--with attribution, yet--from West Side Story. For a while I comforted myself with the thought that West Side Story is more a rock musical than Hair, at least in spirit. But the orchestral homages to Uncle Lennie ruin the effect.
"
FALSE,B-,Welcome to My Nightmare,Alice Cooper,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6629,"
The solo debut actually ain't so bad--no worse than all the others. ""Department of Youth"" is his catchiest teen power song to date, ""Cold Ethyl"" his catchiest necrophilia song to date, and ""Only Women Bleed"" the most explicitly feminist song to hit top forty since ""I Am Woman."" Alice's nose for what the kids want to hear is as discriminating as it is impervious to moral suasion, so perhaps this means that the more obvious feminist truisms have become conventional wisdom among at least half our adolescents. Encouraging.

FALSE,B-,Revenge Will Come,Greg Copeland,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4585,"
Producer Jackson Browne has gone after absolutely predictable midtempo studio rock, but with a tough edge that's augmented by Copeland, who sounds like (of all things) Jackson Browne with a tough edge. Propitious--if Copeland can move his mentor's personalist millenarianism far enough left to write protest lyrics that surrender neither psychological dimension nor American mythos, I bet other young rock mainstreamers are thinking the same way.

FALSE,B-,The Real Great Escape,Larry Coryell,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6635,"
A last-ditch attempt at an album of rock and roll songs, including two by Jimmy Webb (one belongs to P.F. Sloan), Julie's ""Are You Too Clever"" (somebody'd better be), and Larry's ""Makes Me Wanna Shout"" (lucky it doesn't make him wanna croon). Not as bad as it might be--it has lots of rough charm and virtuosic passages, and the band sounds gutsy. But those who seek after albums of rock and roll songs will not be impressed.

Put this on the shelf behind Bowie's Pin Ups and Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll, which also seemed ""important"" when they appeared. Take it from me, EC fans: start with the Flying Burrito Brothers' Gilded Palace of Sin, then try 24 of Hank Williams' Greatest Hits, then George Jones's All-Time Greatest Hits: Volume 1, and Merle Haggard's Songs I'll Always Sing. Then start exploring.

Coulson exploits that natural catch in his voice, a hint of vibrato that walks the line between yearning and good cheer, to bridge his Scottish loyalties and his American stylistic referents--this is genuinely mid-Atlantic singing. But if you want to be an interpreter you'd better find interpretees who give you more to say than Gallagher &amp; Lyle. High point: ""Job on the Tyne,"" which he cocomposed. Hope he keeps trying.

FALSE,B-,August and Everything After,Counting Crows,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6227,"
Adam Duritz sings like the dutiful son of permissive parents I hope don't sit next to me at Woodstock. He went to good summer camps; he doesn't eat junk food; he's confused about all the right things. And he's not going away anytime soon--so starved are his peers for a show of musical emotion more learned than Mariah Carey's that some even compare him to Van Morrison, as if all sodden self-pity were the same. It doesn't end with Duritz, either--""Mr. Jones"" and ""Anna Begins"" might live up to the songs in them if the band conceived the tracks as music first and songs second. Folk-rockers never do.

From the time they stormed a jaded--hence novelty-hungry--CBGB two or three years ago, they've been a joke that wears thin before it's over. ""TV Set"" and ""Garbage Man"" and a couple of others are everything they're supposed to be--archetypally rockin', outrageously funny. But when the songs are neither or even only one, the band's inability to sing, play, produce, or prance around your living room detracts significantly from your pleasure. Then you stop listening altogether.

FALSE,B-,At Crooked Lake,Crazy Horse,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6645,"
Rick and Mike Curtis, whoever they are, replace George Whitsell and John Blanton, whoever they were, and the improvement exceeds statistical likelihood. Anybody who misses circa-1966 Byrds will be pleased to learn that this country-rock album features songs about spaceships, the brotherhood of man, and singing in a rock and roll band. And disappointed to learn that none of them sounds like a sure shot.

FALSE,B-,You Don't Mess Around With Jim,Jim Croce,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15524,"
A nice, original persona here--the truck driver, world-weary machismo with a heart of gold--plus a song that should be even better than the title hit, ""Operator."" More than a novelty, less than the big star he doubtless wants to be, he'll be around.

FALSE,B-,Deja Vu,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6655,"
Of the five (or seven, I forget) memorable tunes here, N's ""Our House"" is a charming but cloying evocation of puppy domesticity, while both N's sanctimonious ""Teach Your Children"" and C's tragicomic ""Almost Cut My Hair"" document how the hippie movement has corrupted our young people. S half scores twice and in-law M provides the climax. Which leaves Y's ""Helpless"" as the group's one unequivocal success this time out. It's also Y's guitar--with help from S and hired hands T and R--that make the music work, not those blessed harmonies. And Y wasn't even supposed to be in on this.

FALSE,B-,4-Way Street,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6656,"
Was it only two years ago that the formation of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash brought gladness to the hearts of rock and rollers who remembered that they loved tight songs rather than endless jams and believed that an ex-Hollie's pop sense would temper Byrds/Springfield folk-rock? Who would have figured that none of them would remember that rock and roll is also supposed to be funky--and fast. And that the best stuff on their live album would be the jams, dominated by the new guy, who would also write their tightest songs? And for that matter that a singalong of dig-its and right-ons by the man who wrote ""For What It's Worth"" and a goody-goody song about  Chicago by the ex-Hollie would sound like political high points?

FALSE,B-,So Far,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6657,"
This group might benefit from a compilation that concentrated on guitar interactions and uptempo throwaways. Needless to say, that's not the one we get.

FALSE,B-,Alvin Crow and the Pleasant Valley Boys,Alvin Crow and the Pleasant Valley Boys,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6660,"
We can't be sure what it was like to hear Bob Wills's records as they came out in the '30s and '40s, but no matter what your Texas friends tell you it was a lot more exciting than this. For starters, Wills was an inventor rather than a flamekeeper, and he got clearer sound--he worked for major labels, after all. Also, Wills released singles, which means that unlike Crow he had to put out one A side for every B. Still, three or four A sides out of ten isn't bad. Just wish they were all as modern as ""Nyquil Blues,"" in which Crow praises analgesics, decongestants, and antihistamines--by name.

FALSE,B-,Floating into the Night,Julee Cruise,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8222,"
This new age chantoozy is no mushmelon: her sentimental schlock and quasi-classical quietude are at the forefront of the latest hip convolutions. And when admirers claim she sounds best in a dark room at three in the morning, I wonder whether she puts them to sleep too.
"
FALSE,B-,Twentysomething,Jamie Cullum,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12591,"
This Brit is good enough at what he does to make you wonder why he bothers. With Norah Jones putting young-person-with-old-ideas shtick in the bank, the commercial logic we get. But beyond a cross-generational reach achievable in any genre and a swinging musicality he negotiates with too much heavy breathing, what's the artistic payoff? Writingwise he ain't Sondre Lerche, much less Nellie McKay. Interpretively, ""Blame It on My Youth"" exploits his age for good cheap irony, ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is a nice Mitch Mitchell tribute, and that's it. You say Harry Connick Jr. would never try a Radiohead cover? Score one for New Orleans.

"
FALSE,B-,In Lust,The Dance,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11401,"
You'd think a band obsessed with sex as both physical and meaningful would make records with more touch and depth (not to mention thrust). Instead they're naggingly hypnotic at best and blandly tentative at worst. Must have something to do with their other obsession: ""survival"".
"
FALSE,B-,Honey in the Rock,Charlie Daniels,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6672,"
For a sideman-turned-sortastar, Daniels kicks out genuine jams and takes genuine chances--the raveup on ""Revelations,"" for instance, would sound plumb weird on an Allmans LP. Not a bad songwriter, either. But hardly a remarkable one, and he's a lousy singer--only on ""Uneasy Rider,"" a talking blues as dry as any of Dylan's and a lot more yarnlike, does his voice serve his vision, such as it is.

FALSE,B-,Lucifuge,Danzig II,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8696,"
I'm sure Glenn Danzig is right about Jim Morrison. If he hadn't given up the ghost, the fourth Door would have stepped up his flirtation with Satan and adjusted his music to a metallic pitch of precision preening. But then, I already knew Morrison was a putz. Misfits fans had convinced me to hold out some hope for Glenn.

FALSE,B-,Betty Davis,Betty Davis,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6677,"
Between her connections (wife of Miles, girlfriend of Jimi) and her concept (autonomous black woman forges metal funk), Betty's got a head start in the hype department. She makes up for these advantages, however, with a forced, narrow voice and a complete absence of riff sense or melodic gift. On the other hand, she--or producer-drummer Greg Errico of the Family Stone--does know a lot about rhythm. Upshot: most overstated comic-book sex since Angelfood McSpade.
"
FALSE,B-,Color of Success,Morris Day,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4626,"
Now that he's a movie star, Morris proposes to cover his flank and go straight. After all, the Time's comically cocksure overstatement was just a way to get the music noticed, and now that he's a household name his sidelong synthbeats will pull in the customers all by themselves. He thinks. I think people will demand beats and comedy both. We shall see.
"
FALSE,B-,We Have Come for Your Children,Dead Boys,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6686,"
Because they're lovable little scumbags deep down, and sincere to boot, Hilly's punk purists have dropped the heavy misogyny and recorded five cuts that laid end to end would make a listenable side. But not even the rousing ""3rd Generation Nation"" has the power of sexist spew like ""I Need Lunch"" and ""Caught With the Meat in Your Mouth."" Makes you wonder what 3rd generation nihilists believe deep down.

FALSE,B-,"In God We Trust, Inc.",Dead Kennedys,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4630,"
""Moral Majority,"" which proceeds directly from the Mickey Mouse club theme to a rousing verse prominently featuring the words ""Blow it out your ass,"" and the long-awaited ""Nazi Punks Fuck Off"" (""you'll be the first to go"") are their best songs or whatever since they attacked California and Cambodia. Both are available on a single. Forgo the documentary value of ""Kepone Factory""'s false start (""Itstooslow"") and the intensely appropriate ""Hyperactive Child."" Think small.

I was delighted that these hostile but not asocial fellows hadn't taken to agonizing over their girlfriends, assuming they have any--they were playing the songs for laffs just like on the debut. Then I noticed that except for ""Beach Party Vietnam"" I wasn't laffing (or even chuckling), only smiling encouragingly now and then. Between the right attitude and the right stuff falls the lead balloon.

I don't get this. We listen to a Snoop or Lil Jon record--I do, anyway--and say, Yeah, the music is pretty good, but it's really no fun hearing women degraded that way, so the hell with those guys. Maybe if the funk is terrific (Cam'ron, or the new improved--and somewhat more mild-mannered--50) or the rhymes acute (Jay-Z, Ghostface), we let down our guard and try to hear how the other half feels. Otherwise no. So why is this tight, intense, recidivist screech-and-crunch exempted from such complex responses?  Preferring funk to crunch as I do, maybe I'm merely insensible to the guitars' siren call. Or maybe its slaves are insensible to misogyny that stops at cut-and-run man's-gotta-do you-hurt-me-too, rather than claiming to control that 'ho.

This is the story of Dan Zanes--his passion, his pain, his steadfast refusal to hire a synth player. Its real location is Anywhere, U.S.A. ""I Still Want You"" would make some garage band a nice slow one.

FALSE,B-,The Dells,The Dells,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6692,"
Vocal groupies and Chicago soul loyalists believe Don Davis has revitalized the old-timers on this album and its predecessor, Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation. I suppose he has. But the Dells are quintessential journeymen, and when Davis made quasi-neo-Temptations out of the Dramatics he wrote the songs himself.
"
FALSE,B-,John Denver's Greatest Hits,John Denver,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6696,"
I still don't like Denver, who purveys privacy in hockey rinks and who never wonders how we are to ""maintain our society"" by contact with wilderness without destroying said wilderness. But except for the odious ""Follow Me""--so that's why he loves his Annie so much--I find this stuff inoffensive when it's not likable. Twice it's brilliant: ""Leaving, on a Jet Plane"" and ""Goodbye Again"" are the essence of domesticus interruptus. Not that he's as talented as many of his supposed rivals. But he aims lower.
"
FALSE,B-,The Layla Sessions,Derek and the Dominos,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5842,"
Sloughing off the myth of the album as artistic unit and denying proven spendthrifts a face-saving shred of consumerly discrimination, CD boxes are invariably about marketing rather than music. But this triple smells. Supposedly necessitated by the slovenliness of Layla's first digital remix, still for sale as a ""special-price"" double-CD even though the same material squeezes onto one disc here, it pretends that Eric Clapton's finest pickup band--which as the notes inadvertently remind us begat George Harrison's endless All Things Must Pass (you remember ""Apple Jam,"" now don't you?)--deserves the kind of genius treatment that's dubious even with great jazz improvisors. And since it unearths not much Duane Allman (no surprise, since he barely met the band), it cheats on the dueling-guitars fireworks that made Layla explode. This is pop, gang--arrangements matter. Outtakes are outtakes because the keepers are better. Jams take too long to get anywhere worth going. And when a mix trades raunch for definition, the exchange is usually moot.

FALSE,B-,New Arrangement,Jackie DeShannon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6701,"
As an American songwriter who has escaped the confessional mode, and as a woman who can sing about subjects other than men, DeShannon exemplifies several healthy trends. The main thing this well-made record reveals, however, is an intelligent professionalism that matters about as much as a surge in enrollment in creative writing classes or women's liberation for female executives.

If the first version of the early disco classic this album is named after, then entitled ""Feel the Need in Me,"" moved like a crack diesel, quickening one whole side of what would have been a pretty good LP in any case, then the remade track moves more like a monorail. And while in the end I don't appreciate the streamlining (especially since the B side is quite extraneous) it still sounds pretty good.

FALSE,B-,Duty Now for the Future,Devo,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1018,"
Side one, with its not-funny-enough instrumentals and evasive satire, was dire enough to make me suspect they'd made their arena-rock move before there was an arena in the world that would have them. But ""The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize"" and ""Secret Agent Man"" are as bright as anything on the debut, and the arrangements offer their share of surprizes.

FALSE,B-,A Mad and Faithful Telling,DeVotchKa,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14000,"
The most overrated band of the year (so far, so far) has never called a record Gypsy Vamps and Things. It did, however, call one Supermelodrama. Although Nick Urata can't match pipes with Richard Hawley, a plus in a way, he's hawking mellifluous overstatement flavored with a nostalgia far enough past its sell-by date that it stinks a little. Foregrounding Hungarian violins rather than Balkan brass, the Gypsy thing is more a borderline-genteel branding device. Humor is discernible in ""Basso Profundo,"" ""Head Honcho,"" and ""Transliterator""--if you seek it out, as I am paid to do. Songs one can relate to as songs are harder to come by.

Parody punks long dismissed as no-laff ninnies even in L.A., they're rehabilitating their reputations as their accounting careers fall through, with this '78-'80 compilation (in tandem with current product to remain nameless) the spearhead. So OK, sometimes they actually were funny--I like their Simon &amp; Garfunkel knockoff better than the Coolies'. I promise I'll play them on request if they promise I never have to think about them again.

FALSE,B-,Bloodbrothers,The Dictators,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6714,"
Because they're nice Jewish boys deep down, and sincere to boot, they offer good-humored satiric putdowns of kinky sex and teenage alienation, encouragement for R. Meltzer, and a patriotic anthem that might be scary if they were capable of sustaining the mood without cracking up. All of which is grounded, unfortunately, not in the great common store of stoopid-rock readymades but in the grade-C Blue Oyster Cult moves that their gradual accumulation of instrumental competence has earned them.

Twelve toons, which because they include three new originals and two new covers don't even constitute a half-assed best-of. As annotator Borneo Jimmy points out, ""Rock and Roll Made a Man Out of Me"" is for these boys an admission of defeat. To dig their stoopid smarts you'll have to seek out Go Girl Crazy, cut before they turned into grown-up buffoons with pro-am chops, and funnier without stage patter than this is with.

""The songs/they come out more slowly/Now that I am the bad guy,"" she allows in the best song-not-track here. But maybe admitting that you require more patience than the average lover has in him or her is a way of evading harder truths--namely, that songs also come out more slowly when you're selling as opposed to defining yourself, as she did for so long with such charm, chutzpah, wit, grit, and politics. This is a double album where the best songwriting never meshes with the best horn writing, which is what gets her juices going these days. That is, it's a double album marking a year she should have taken off. Intelligence you can count on. Integrity you can foster. But inspiration requires more patience than the average genius has in her, and let us not forget the average label owner.

D&amp;C succumb to the folk fallacy. That is, they relate themselves to an alien and/or past musical style, purist country western, rather than relating the style to themselves, as Gram Parsons does. The songs are good and well-played, and two cuts--a brilliant version of ""Don't Let Me Down"" and Clark's ""Corner Street Bar""--transcend the Bad Concept which ruins this album for me. But I know damned well that I may never play it again, because basically it's just another archive.

Armed with an acoustic guitar and a wire-rimmed smile, Dion has been projecting the aura of the quintessential Bronx rocker ever since reviving his career in clubs three years ago. On this LP he applies his sweet, sliding, blues-based style to both quintessential Bronx rockers and acoustic-guitar specialties, though his good-humored stage patter seems coyer every time it repeats. Still wish he (or Warners) would put ""Your Own Back Yard,"" his song about him and heroin, on an album. And forget ""Abraham, Martin, and John.""

Boy, people are getting bored with these guys fast--if they don't watch out they're gonna last about as long as Looking Glass or the Lemon Pipers. Just another case of ""substance"" as novelty, I guess--doesn't sound bad, but they'd better up those beats-per-minute.

FALSE,B-,Brothers in Arms,Dire Straits,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4666,"
""Money for Nothing"" is a catchy sumbitch, no getting around it, and the first side moves with simple generosity, not a virtue one associates with this studio guitarist's ego trip. But it's too late for the old bluesboy to suck us into his ruminations of the perfidy of woman and the futility of political struggle, and ""Money for Nothing"" is also a benchmark of pop hypocrisy. We know Mark Knopfler's working-class antihero is a thicky because he talks like Randy Newman and uses the same word for homosexual that old bluesboys use, a word Knopfler has somehow gotten on the radio with no static from the PMRC. I mean, why not ""little nigger with the spitcurl"" instead of ""little faggot with the earring,"" Mark? And while we're at it, how the hell did you end up on MTV? By spelling its name right?

FALSE,B-,Money for Nothing,Dire Straits,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4667,"
An active member of the Fraternal Order of Old Farts since birth, Mark Knopfler has always identified simply, spontaneously, and soddenly with anybody who's bitter because life has passed him by--no, not ""him or her,"" that's just the kind of pussyfooting a man's man won't abide. He's most convincing when directing his empathy at musicians--cf. ""Sultans of Swing,"" in which glam types reject trad tsk-tsk, and ""The Walk of Life,"" in which our hero dances as best he can. Skillfully accompanied on guitar, his supposedly unfashionable ressentiment has made him a rich man. How could such a thing happen?

From Fabian and Chubby Checker to Cosby and this crew, Philadelphia has always produced too many unthreatening teen dreams--it's enough to make you stop worrying and love Schoolly-D. Though I grant the Fresh Prince's acting ability and find myself touched when he tells the crowd he's 17, he makes the mistake of coming on smug in a genre whose staple is confidence. In life, maybe the wheedle is more socially advanced than the demand; in art, it's a turnoff.

Decking their cover with quotes from Durutti and Chagall and slogans like ""Bring Back the Future"" and ""We Don't Need Unity . . . We Need Co-Operation,"" these Vancouver lifers have obviously made something of their hardcore anarchism. If only the music had as much spirit. Amid the slightly Britified metal-mania so many professional punks drift into, the great moments are stolen--a speed-anthem cover of ""Singin' in the Rain"" and a ""Hot Blooded"" rip calling for a ""General Strike."" But since property is theft, maybe that's as it should be.

FALSE,B-,Revisited,Dr. Hook,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6728,"
Although his rock and roll number with this band was often forced and unfunny, you have to admire Shel Silverstein's eye for detail and ear for diction, his willingness to go for the aorta, and his did-he-mean-that? humor. This compilation includes ""Cover of the Rolling Stone,"" still an acute account of the superstar half-life, and ""Carry Me, Carrie,"" based on a text by Theodore Dreiser, as well as several salubriously blasï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ references to ""Penicillin Penny,"" who after all got her dose from someone with a penis.

FALSE,B-,The Brightest Smile in Town,Dr. John,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4680,"
By playing the preserver of New Orleans piano tradition, the Dr. does an injustice to his equally fertile heritage as a music-biz sharpie, and too often on his second unaccompanied mostly-instrumental album he's as pleasant and boring as any other session man doing his thing. The new Pomus-Rebennack tune that kicks off side two raises hopes of a half save--until he stops singing again.
"
FALSE,B-,Rat On!,Swamp Dogg,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3375,"
Soul-seekers like myself are moderately mad for the obscure Total Destruction to Your Mind, which Mr. Dogg, formerly Atlantic producer Jerry Williams, put out on the obscure Canyon label a couple of years ago--strange, powerful, creaky voice, stranger sensibility, demented music. But the dementia on this moderately mad sequel seems laid on for appearance's sake. I'll be seeking on.
"
FALSE,B-,I'm Not Selling Out/I'm Buying In,Swamp Dogg,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4682,"
One problem with pinning your hopes on eccentrics is that they're hard to tell from cranks. He's right about El Salvador and baby formula, wrong about abortion and loud dance music, boring about natural foods, the media, etc. And only when Esther Phillips pitches in does his beloved soul music get over.
"
FALSE,B-,One Step Closer,The Doobie Brothers,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8224,"
The absence of must-hums brings into stark relief the magnitude of their debt to Steely Dan. Michael McDonald, of course, but more significantly Skunk Baxter, now departed and and you can't even tell, so sedulously do the other guitarists emulate his virtuoso harmonies. The Doobies are now socially responsible artists, stopping at nothing in their battle to let the radio audience taste musical quality in the breaks. If the songs themselves had any content, well then obviously there'd be no chance to enlighten the masses. Don't dare ask them to abandon this mission.
"
FALSE,B-,The Doors,The Doors,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10988,"
I admit that some of the tunes retain considerable nostalgic appeal, but there's no way I can get around it--Jim Morrison sounds like an asshole.
"
FALSE,B-,The Soft Parade,The Doors,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10968,"
No one even thinks about the Doors any more--such is fame--but this is an acceptable record, with predictable pretensions and two or three first-rate songs (""Touch Me,"" ""Wild Child""). Nothing to get excited about, either way.
"
FALSE,B-,Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine,The Doors,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6748,"
This two-LP compendium has a theme that goes beyond ""He's dead, so we'd better get in there quick."" It's Morrison-as-politician, compiled by an a&amp;r guy who took him seriously, and why not--in Morrison's politics, a&amp;r guys were adjuncts of the prime movers of history. This includes enough solid album tracks and post-13 hits to suck in the poppyboppers plus the best of the pretentious stuff--""Five to One,"" ""Horse Latitudes,"" ""When the Music's Over,"" and of course ""The End."" Which latter is the test--specifically the line ""Mother I want to yeearrrgh."" When I first heard it, it made me grimace; how it makes me guffaw. If it still gives you chills, you may want to buy this for your favorite niece of nephew. Inspirational Image: ""mute nostril agony.""

FALSE,B-,"Alive, She Cried",The Doors,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8226,"
The concert and sound-check tapes they've unearthed for the revival are of some quality, with Robbie Krieger a white blues twister on ""Little Red Rooster"" and Jim Morrison an effective focus as long as he just sings. But when he emits his poetry or deigns to lay his narcissistic come-on on an imaginary teeny-bopper, it is to duck. If kids today feel cheated by history because they never experienced the fabled Jimbo charisma first hand, that's one more reason to be glad there are no new rock heroes.

I don't have the stomach to go check my Toto and Journey records; in fact, I don't have my Toto and Journey records. But the burden of proof is on the perp. Technically proficient, melodically resourceful, sonically up-to-date--Toto and Journey were all that. They also rocked moderato and sang as if thoughtfully plumbing their Caucasian feelings. Admittedly, the Brits' squarer sense of form boxes their corn up more discreetly, and their reassuring lyrical generalizations address matters of the spirit more than affairs of the heart. Also, they're not yet huge here, which means so much to young people seeking identities they don't have to share like Legos, although older people pining for their pop youth would just as soon they turn into the Beatles (sigh). Nevertheless, this is as vapid as it is expert, and if it ever does get huge here, a lot of slightly older people are going to wonder what they were thinking.
"
FALSE,B-,Wrong Side of Memphis,Johnny Dowd,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1809,"
The vita that marks this middle-aged Ithaca moving man as a genuwine everyman reduces just as readily to boho-with-a-day-job, and lest you look down on him he's careful to stick an ""existential"" into the one about the ""Average Guy,"" so-called. When he finds ""tender love,"" his tropes pick up considerable--""Like beans and rice she's a total plateful,"" nice and homely. But soon it's back to murder and misery in the dismal swamp quote unquote, with malnourished blues to match. Gangsta folk--not only are the stories old hat, the beats suck.

FALSE,B-,Medicine Show,The Dream Syndicate,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4686,"
Very subtle--the sharper you listen the duller it sounds. Those desperate for Tom Verlaine's next one might conceivably settle for Sandy Pearlman's ampliclarification of Karl Precoda's guitar, but now that Steve Wynn is flexing his literary imagination we know where the interpersonal vignettes on the debut came from: when he grows up, Steve wants to write new journalism about adolescent anomie for California magazine.

John Mayall produced this low-key English blues record, which works better for me than any of Mayall's highly-touted recent stuff. Recommended to fans of Mayall and of Fleetwood Mac, which it resembles.
"
FALSE,B-,Decade,Duran Duran,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4695,"
Liars till the end, they pretend their decade didn't end around 1984-'85, when U.K. new pop conquered the world and went phfft. But the best-of proves it. First side's all anyone needs of the brightly tuneful meaninglessness that made them video stars, and after side two cut one, ""The Reflex,"" they sink into an anonymity relieved only by the greatest record they never made, Nile Rodgers's ""Notorious,"" and the softcore closer ""All She Wants."" Sometimes I think the little girls don't understand a damn thing.
"
FALSE,B-,Lord Upminster,Ian Dury,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4697,"
""Spasticus Autisticus"" is every bit as startling as Dury must have hoped after Laughter got lost in the hustle, but on the rest of his major-label move he sounds like a retired ad man. I suppose the idea is to let the riddims of Steve Stanley, Chaz Jankel, and Sly &amp; Robbie turn jingles into rallying cries, but how much human kindness can you sell with slogans like ""escape is a jape""?
"
FALSE,B-,Desire,Bob Dylan,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=373,"
In the great tradition of Grand Funk Railroad, Dylan has made an album beloved by tour devotees--including those who were shut out of Rolling Thunder's pseudocommunitarian grooviness except via the press. It is not beloved by me. Although the candid propaganda and wily musicality of ""Hurricane"" delighted me for a long time, the deceitful bathos of its companion piece, ""Joey,"" tempts me to question the unsullied innocence of Rubin Carter himself. These are not protest songs, folks, not in the little-people tradition of ""Hattie Carroll""; their beneficiaries are (theoretically) wronged heroes, oppressed overdogs not unlike our beleaguered superstar himself. And despite his show of openness, our superstar may be feeling oppressed. His voice sounds viscous and so do his rhymes, while sisters Ronee and Emmylou sound distinctly kid, following the leader as if they're holding onto his index finger. More genuinely fraternal (and redeeming) are the pained, passionate marital tributes, ""Sara"" and ""Isis.""
"
FALSE,B-,Hard Rain,Bob Dylan,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6758,"
The only reason people are disgusted with this record is that they're sick of Dylan--which is understandable, but unfair to the record. The palookas who backed him on this tour sure ain't the Band, and the music and arrangements suffer accordingly--these guys are folkies whose idea of rock and roll is rock and roll clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s. But the material i""Oh Sister"" and ""Shelter From the Storm""--Dylan sings very well indeed.
"
FALSE,B-,Shot of Love,Bob Dylan,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4699,"
Dylan's abandonment of Muscle Shoals for the fleshpots of El Lay--Benmont Tench! Ron Wood! Ringo Starr on tom tom!--has a reassuring aura of apostasy, which may be why I think this year's born-again boilerplate ""sounds better"" than last year's. But two songs that belong in the lower reaches of his canon don't hurt. ""Property of Jesus,"" about how bad it is to mock born-againers, has Staple Singers written all over it. ""Lenny Bruce"" is apostasy down to its reverent setting.
"
FALSE,B-,Infidels,Bob Dylan,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4700,"
All the wonted care Dylan has put into this album shows--musically, ""License to Kill"" is the only dud. His distaste for the daughters of Satan has gained complexity of tone--neither dismissive nor vituperative, he addresses women with a solicitousness that's strangely chilling, as if he knows what a self-serving hypocrite he's being, but only subliminally. At times I even feel sorry for him, just as he intends. Nevertheless, this man has turned into a hateful crackpot. Worse than his equation of Jews with Zionists with the Likud or his utterly muddled disquisition on international labor is the ital Hasidism that inspires no less than three superstitious attacks on space travel. God knows (and I use that phrase advisedly) how far off the deep end he'll go if John Glenn becomes president.
"
FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits Volume 2,The Eagles,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4709,"
I admit it--this made my A shelves after the Bellamy Brothers softened me up. But that was unjust to the Bellamy Brothers. The Eagles are slimy not smarmy, pulchritudinous not purty, multiplatinum titans not singles artists, pretentious cynics not small-time con men, Topanga Canyon not San Fernando Valley. Sure their tunesmanship, zeitgeistheit, and guitar goodies were fun on the radio. But the next time I weeded my shelves, they were tracked to the reference collection.
"
FALSE,B-,Head to the Sky,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6769,"
In the beginning Maurice White created Hummit Music. But not until the morning of the fourth album did he come up with a tune to match, complete with sweet clear harmonies and sinuous beat. Catchy title, too: ""Evil,"" to be dispersed by prayer. Most of the first side keeps up the good work, although only rarely--as on the falsetto climax of ""Keep Your Head to the Sky""--is it quite as transcendent physically as the lyrics would seem to demand. But the mood jazz excursion on side two exposes White's essential fatuousness. ""Zanzibar,"" it's called, as befits a travelogue; its saxophone solo (by Ronnie Laws's replacement, Andrew Woolfolks) could make Alice Coltrane blush.
"
FALSE,B-,Life on the Line,Eddie and the Hot Rods,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6773,"
I'm not inclined to get judgmental here. It's true that Eddie's sunlamp tan and health-club bod make him the logical successor to Shaun Cassidy. True too that the teen-militant lyrics are strictly rote, and that their hooks hardly compare with Mann &amp; Weil's. Still, this is quite a bit solider than any album Paul Revere and the Raiders or the Dave Clark Five ever made--not counting greatest hits collections, of course.
"
FALSE,B-,Information,Dave Edmunds,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4724,"
Not since the onset of a career always marked by consistent taste and uncertain utility has Edmunds strayed so far from the trad, and though his perfidy/courage is characteristically marginal, it's still a mistake. The two Jeff Lynne-produced tracks have given him the hit he needs, but where 1971's echoey ""I Hear You Knockin'"" was a departure, 1983's teched-up ""Slipping Away"" is an accommodation to marketing trends the Edmunds of Rockpile bucked. And as a symptom of his faltering commitment, the songs he's selected for side two are quite humdrum, which isn't characteristic at all.
"
FALSE,B-,New York at Dawn,Elbow Bones and the Racketeers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4728,"
With a new Dr. Buzzard in the works and Kid Creole still August Darnell's principal outlet, it's amazing that he's found time and songs for yet another project--or so I thought until I heard the project. Only the declaration of infidelity ""Other Guys"" is more than a skillful black-music genre exercise, and though other singers might pull it out, Gichy Dan and Stephanie Fuller don't.

FALSE,B-,No Answer,Electric Light Orchestra,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6778,"
In which Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne work out their obsession with celli, French horns, and such like. The result is crude chamber music in rock time--pretty tuneful, and sometimes pretty funny as it lumbers along. Might even get interesting if Wood and Lynne weren't also working out their obsession with suffering ladies. Though they do OK by suffering men.

I've been trying to figure out why this group doesn't quite make it for six months, and I've finally hit on it--they don't write good songs. Also, Stan Bronstein sings as if the Establishment was stepping on his foot.
"
FALSE,B-,The Eleventh House Featuring Larry Coryell,The Eleventh House Featuring Larry Coryell,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6783,"
In person, Coryell's restless imagination has held its own against Alphonse Mouzon's cute Latin funkisms and Randy Brecker's plasma, perspiration, and lachrymal secretions. In fact, I've found the synthesis hard and multilayered--but maybe it was just loud. Here the guitarist's straining electronicism is subsumed in neat melodic contrivances. Depressing--when somebody deserves better for as long as Coryell, you begin to wonder.
"
FALSE,B-,Lorraine Ellison,Lorraine Ellison,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6784,"
Ellison's voice is so gorgeous and her spirit so possessed that it's hard to hear exactly what she's singing--you're riveted as she swoops over Ted Templeman's stark, gospel-drenched production, but nothing attaches itself permanently. Doesn't help that sometimes the swoop becomes a shriek, either.
"
FALSE,B-,Movin' Up,The Elvis Brothers,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4730,"
If you're really committed to the ""fun"" only unpretentious pop can provide, you might as well go directly to these proud posers, who generate hooks in an abundance that will shame whatever ""authentic"" locals you retain a sentimental yen for. Connoisseurs of pop plasticity will get an additional kick out of how affectlessly they shift from the usual ersatz teen romance to equally meaningless and equally commercial outlaw and rebel themes. Plus an uncanny Beatle impression on ""It's So Hard.""
"
FALSE,B-,Dig All Night,Joe Ely,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4733,"
Not one track runs under four minutes. Not one reveals why he was ever mistaken for country. Not one was written by Butch Hancock, by anybody but Joe--though he did get help on the title tune, which suggests a self-knowledge otherwise in retreat.

As he told ""XXL"": ""I wanted to go back to Proof's idea of, 'Let's just say the most f*cked up sh*t we can say.'"" In other words, this great artist's big concept for his first album since 2004 is a D12 homage. Having slyly categorized it as horrorcore early on, and riding Dr. Dre's most bombastic beats ever, he unrolls the offensive work of art bluenoses have always insisted was there: misogyny up the wazoo, lesbians-only homophobia, libels for a stepdad, murders unnumbered, sexual humiliations previously unknown to hip-hop and more dropped names than Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, who's funnier--and also, uh-oh, more boyish. In a socially redeeming denouement, all of this and more is blamed on the drugs we hope he's kicked, we really do. There's even an inspirational number no more boring than the one about offing Lindsay Lohan. But for the first time in his career Eminem settles for sensationalism straight up, and, worse still, makes you wonder whether he ever truly knew the difference. Em, this is not a Slim Shady album. Slim Shady had a lightness about him.

FALSE,B-,EV3,En Vogue,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5218,"
Sylvia Rhone isn't going to pull the plug on her copyright just because Dawn Robinson has decided she's the reason for her own success. So with yeomanlike help from Babyface, the label has laboriously extracted a hit and some platinum from Rhone's three remaining charges as they strain for soul and funk as stagily and dutifully as the fabricated bevy of talent-hunt beauties they've always been. Sole exception: the Robinson-led Set It Off smash ""Don't Let Go (Love)."" There's a lesson in that, right? Only what will that lesson be when Robinson's debut does the dog?

After honoring Bernard Herrmann with some keyb-simulated RZA, Dre recedes (none too soon) and the music spares out--Wasis Diop kora sample today, mbira tomorrow. Foxy's pussycentrism gives the finger to the funniest male orgasm on record. And black Mafia fantasies threaten white male corporate oppression. (Just kidding.)

The one and only rock breakthrough of this disastrous year is less dire than you'd think. They're Christians, but goth-metal Christians. I mean they're goth-metal, but goth-metal Christians. I mean they're Christians who told a webzine that ""the world is filled with hateful people who parade the name of Christ like a badge that grants them immunity to destroy anyone that disagrees with them,"" celebrated their megahit debut with Dom Perignon, and were yanked from Bible stores for using bad words in Entertainment Weekly. Their faith, as embodied in Amy Lee's clarion sopralto, lends their goth-metal a palpable sweetness. Now if only it wasn't goth-metal at all.

They were a vital team right up to Roots in 1968, but then they lost it, which was perhaps a cause of their estrangement, perhaps a result, or perhaps mere entropy. This 1983 gig was their first in ten years, and they sure didn't slough it off. But it's nostalgia anyway, adding nothing but a pushy drummer and a slight slackening of the voices to a superb body of work available in better record stores everywhere.

This paints its frontwomen a blank beige so as not to distract from the electrobeats, which it mixes high and clear enough to deliver three dancy hits and set up the platinum-plated schlockaballad ""Seasons Change."" Smart shoppers will note that the ""Seasons Change"" 12-inch features a 10-minute megamix of said hits, then learn that the megamix isn't quite long enough--the thrill of a great electrobeat is having it ravish you again after you thought you'd had your fill. Damn bizzers nail you coming and going.

The groove's tough enough, but like their fellow retroists the Bangles they don't write 'em as good as they pick 'em. This is the wages of retro--trying to replicate the musical spirit of a time that's passed means going against history and sacrificing the authenticity retroists live for. Can't blame Dave Edmunds for that. Or for the video, either.
"
FALSE,B-,Liege and Lief,Fairport Convention,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1224,"
Because the rhythm section has oomph and the singer soul, their pursuit of the Pentangle down the wooded path of jigs and ballads isn't entirely disastrous. But it sounds more like liege than lief to me. Traditional or original, these songs are either momentary escapes--that is, dances--or tales of common folk battling fate and the class system to something less than a standoff. Matty Groves outfucks Lord Donald, but Lord Donald kills Matty as well as his own wife; the Deserter is betrayed by comrade and sweetheart, then saved--to be a soldier--by Prince Albert. And the music, inevitably, reflects this fatalism.

FALSE,B-,To Be a Lover,George Faith,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6799,"
I know, you love (and miss) soul music so much you don't care if it's deprived of its cultural context--when you got what it takes you hold on to what you got, right? Well, I don't know. Faith is a soft-sung reggae stylist vaguely reminiscent of early Joe Simon or some small part of David Ruffin. He writes ordinary songs and executes a delightful segue from ""In the Midnight Hour"" to ""Ya Ya."" And he lets you know why he loves ""Turn Back the Hands of Time"" and ""So Fine"" by covering Paul Anka's ""Diana"" along with them.

FALSE,B-,Blazing Away,Marianne Faithfull,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2252,"
Already too damn significant for her own good, the diva-elect displays herself and her tattered repertoire to an adoring St. Anne's claque and gets little help from a band that should know better. I could go back to the disastrous video (shots of microphone bases for variety, pans of stained-glass windows for edification, slo-mo birds for filmpoetry) to make sure that's partner-in-cultdom Barry Reynolds on guitar overkill, not wizard-for-hire Marc Ribot. But since it's definitely Ribot's pal Dougie Bowne laying on the drumrolls, I'd rather not know. Either way the misbegotten strategy is to ratchet up the melodrama until only a cad would deny's she's suffering--and not just because she's worried sick about having to pull this act off forever amen.

With rap, funk, hardcore, and falafel-joint rai seasoning their metallic stew, a new front man thinks hard about life and horror comics while under the influence of I hate to think what. ""Epic,"" which old people will think is about the terrors of sex though it's really about the terrors of everything, and ""Zombie Eaters,"" a jaundiced if not jealous view of a baby's world, delineate their generational chauvinism, and art-AOR keybs establish the depths of their cultural deprivation. Not as stupid as they sound--but do they sound stupid.

New members, even female ones, aren't news with this group, but Mark E.'s guitarist wife Brixe Smith does lend his poetry readings apparent direction. The appearance is created by side-openers that go on so long you don't really notice your attention flagging as their momentum gives way to, well, poetry readings--roughly accompanied, as usual.

Admittedly, the two classic lines Pete Wentz comes up with here--""Imperfect boys with their perfect lives"" and the cheeky Nirvana cop ""I don't care what you think as long as it's about me""--reflect the new thematic legitimacy of superstar self-pity in an era when fans would rather envy their musical heroes than identify with them. But that doesn't mean non-fans should feel obliged to get with the program. Low-tune for a pop band, low-momentum for a rock band, they stand a chance of evoking bad Elvis Costello when they take you by surprise or emote on in the background. In fact, when Mr. C. himself makes a shock-horror guest appearance, he's surprisingly hard to tell from Patrick Stumpf. Which is weird, disturbing--especially for Mr. C.
"
FALSE,B-,Fanny Hill,Fanny,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6808,"
Three albums in not much over a year is two too many, and though half the new material is catchy enough, they give themselves away by opening sides with Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't That Peculiar"" and the Beatles' ""Hey Bulldog."" Several lyrics do groundwork in important women's themes (autonomy, motherhood, like that), but not one--not even ""Wonderful Feeling,"" a disarmingly happy-sounding breakup song--offers the kind of concentrated perception that makes a song work or the kind of ""Charity Ball"" hook that makes you stop wondering whether a song is working.

FALSE,B-,The Question Is No,The Fastbacks,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6278,"
For all its sectarianism, one thing alt-rock produces in superfluity is nice guys--nice guys in nice bands. They're friendly and articulate, they support their scenes, they make music for love. Most likely their music ain't half bad, either. But seldom is it capable of signifying beyond the one-on-one club-circuit ambit. Such bands are praised beyond all reason by the fans they've served so faithfully for so long. In New York the prototype is Tara Key and Tim Harris's Antietam; in Seattle it's this Kurt Bloch-Kim Warnick unit. As you may have read, they're down-to-earth and pop-punky, the very model of a garage band for everyday use. Warnick sounds so sensible you'd loan her your car. And yes, some of Bloch's tunes will get her around the block. But unless you've seen them a few times, or Warnick's honest voice happens to activate your body chemistry, you'll struggle to penetrate the hoopla and then forget you own it.

There are 15 songs here, most of them, from what I read on the back cover, originally hits for producer Huey P. Meaux, who loves Freddy almost as much as he loves his own catalogue. Nice idea. But Freddy's chronic case of hit-or-miss disease is unaffected by this treatment--of the four cuts I'd consider for the Real Best of Freddy cassette I'm going to compile some day, three do not seem to belong to Meaux.

FALSE,B-,Boys and Girls,Bryan Ferry,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=457,"
Sure ""Make believing is the real thing."" When Ferry is grooving, though, the emphasis is on the make-believe, not the real. Here there's heavy slippage, especially on side one. His voice thicker and more mucous, his tempos dragging despite all the fancy beats he's bought, he runs an ever steeper risk of turning into the romantic obsessive he's always played so zealously.
"
FALSE,B-,Mr. Look So Good,"Richard ""Dimples"" Fields",1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4783,"
Aware that Fields brought something quite his own to the soul/r&amp;b heritage, I wondered why his buttery come-on never moved me. Reason's simple--he's as egoistic and ultimately lightweight as James Taylor, another traditionalist original. Dissecting women with a butcher's eye one minute and quoting Biblical prophecy the next, he persuades me of neither his essential goodness nor his essential badness. I've got nothing against the combination, either--just ask Marvin Gaye, who works at least as hard at it as Fields, or Al Green, who doesn't.

FALSE,B-,Jimmy Bell's Still in Town,15-60-75 the Numbers Band,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6817,"
What is this I hear? Some kind of weird cross between the Grateful Dead and the Velvet Underground making its own record in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio? No, that's not what I hear, but the description will have to do until the group comes up with another album--which I hope will feature more public lyrics and a drummer who can propagate the polyrhythms.

FALSE,B-,Elan,Firefall,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6820,"
I do too pay attention to mainstream rock product: in fact, I listened to this five or six times without a trace of stomach upset. The group achieves more of that old CSN(Y) feel than any of the decade's country-rock spinoffs; the album achieves more of that old rock and roll feel than any of the decade's CSN(Y) records. Commendable if not quite recommendable--didn't think they had it in them.

FALSE,B-,Just Folks . . . A Firesign Chat,Firesign Theatre,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11309,"
It's a good year when the grand old men of head comedy release two albums (including Forward Into the Past, a skillfully reedited twofer best-of on Columbia) and Cheech &amp; Chong release none (yet, and let's hope). This LP concentrates on what Firesign does best--turning tolerant radio chitchat into a horror show. But the edge is off their discovery--the details change but the perception itself seems stagnant. For followers only.

FALSE,B-,In Your Face,Fishbone,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4791,"
Last time they looked like sons of P-Funk and sounded like sons of Frank Yankovic's dotage, which suggested their stock in trade was cognitive dissonance. This time they look like 2-Tone fashion plates and sound like big-time new wave satirists, which suggests their stock in trade is haircuts. Uniting the two phases is their sense of rhythm or lack of same.

And from these five songs you still won't believe it. Best but not great is ""The Girl From Baltimore""--real party city, cross between Philly and D.C., none of which the song implies. Nervus Rex album's pretty nice.

This repackaged best-of-Gram is baited with five previously unreleased Parsons vocals. These are nice, but since even an unreconstructed Parsons nut like me can reel off more interesting cover versions of ""Sing Me Back Home"" (the Everlys), ""Break My Mind"" (the Box Tops), and ""To Love Somebody"" (initials: JJ), maybe they were unreleased for a reason. It also puts the six greatest cuts off Gilded Palace of Sin on one side, a convenience I'd appreciate more if Gilded Palace of Sin, the only full-fledged country-rock masterpiece, weren't still in the catalogue. Your local record retailer will no doubt order you one if you take the trouble of kidnapping his children.

Conceived in memory of Chuck Berry when Kim Simmonds began handing out Kenny Burrell chord books to his Savoy Brown cohorts in 1970, this band has taken a good idea way too far. Rod Price's ubiquitous slide and Dave Peverett's iniquitous rave are decent trademarks, but energized becomes enervating in the absence of dynamic changes. Is good competent rock really good and competent if its excitement never transcends the mechanical? Is that what getting off means? So maybe they're not good and competent.

John Simon's settings go every which way--from Muscle Shoals to Kingston, from country to folk to r&amp;b--but always seem to come up pop. Then again, what else do you do with Forbert? He's as all-American as the Band, but beyond that catchy young heartland-soulful voice he has no musical identity: his lyrics are omniverously observant, but beyond an attractive all-purpose compassion they never reveal a point of view either. Steve Forbert Reporting, that's all. Which means you have to care about him as much as he does--""Make It All So Real"" is as shameless as the suffering-artist theme gets--to care about his songs. And the voice doesn't do that for me.

I knew he was the son of Los Van Van's big man first time I played his blandly pretty folk-jazz and chalked its bloodlessness to the suburban New Age crap first harbingered when Kenny Rankin discovered chromatic chords in Marin County 30 years ago. Not until later did I read that the younger Formell had ""literally re-defined the concept of Cuban music,"" only the Commies wouldn't let him so he went into exile, only then he suffered ""rejection"" ""in some communities here in America too."" Self-pity being folk music's universal solvent, my own suspicion is that said communities, if they exist at all, didn't like his clave. Really, JC--I don't care whether you like Castro. I'm a major El Duque fan. I just think you're a wimp.

Not hard to hear why he wanted out of Humble Pie--with his pretty guitar and air of abstracted yearning, the boy's almost a ringer for Dave Mason. He's equally tuneful, vague, and confused about women (""I wasn't made to do no cooking""?). The difference is that Mason would never cover ""Jumping Jack Flash."" But if he did he'd take it at the same insipidly insinuating tempo.

Peter F. is rocking harder, probably because the above-mentioned Camel is a regular touring unit. He's writing fewer catchy tunes, probably because the abovementioned Camel is a regular touring unit. He dedicates a song to his manager, probably because the abovementioned Camel is a regular touring unit. He identifies white sugar as evil, probably because he's into health food.

In which she rejects the producers who made her career for Quincy Jones and drifts off into the hey now hey with rudder trailing. ""So Swell When You're Well"" and ""Sister From Texas"" might sneak onto Spirit in the Dark with a little more funk, and ""Just Right Tonight"" busies itself nicely, but too much of this is pretentious baloney, and ""Somewhere"" and ""Mister Spain"" are horrid.

Yes, there are bright spots--a funk trifle with Re on piano, an autobiographical reminiscence speeded up Vegas-style, her voice. But the guidance she gets from new corporate mentor Clive Davis is typified by the vamp she adds to ""What a Fool Believes."" ""Get the funk, get it now,"" she murmurs valiantly over a rhythm section anchored, as they say, by Louis Johnson and Jeff Porcaro. And who do you think plays the sax outro? If you guessed David Sanborn you get the picture. [Catalogue number: AL 9358.]

With his sharp, nasal drawl, Fred was born to pop, and though he's lost collaborator Andrew Bernard, he's keeping Shreveport's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Fan Club going all by himself.

With the outrageous anticrime message of ""Nuthin'"" and the star-time joyride of ""Lovin' Every Minute of It"" surrounding his Big Hit, I'd call this a one-sided album if I wanted to be kind. But I don't, not when he dedicates it to G-O-D in the absence of Slick Rick and informs the ladies in the house that abortion (rhymes with mind distortion) is of ""the devil."" Buy the single, which doesn't put the Supreme Being so high in the mix. Inspiration Verse: ""Cause I'm like Moses, no one knows this/The way I dress and my lifestyle shows this.""

He tells us right off that he's got ""a rich man's dream"" and ""a poor man's needs""; in other words, he's got the soul of a middle-class kid who hopes he's hitbound and doesn't have the faintest idea what rich men dream about. Hitbound he may be--this is replete with nice reflections nicely melodized. But only once, on the transcendent ""Ariel,"" does he sound as cute as he wants to.

Jazz sophisticates who long ago followed Frisell into the fog won't gainsay his groove at this late date.

Hardly. They're there for color. Frisell cares about color the way Sigur Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s cares about color, and if his hues are somewhat brighter, he doesn't have Iceland f""world music""--articulated rhythm.

FALSE,B-,Official Version,Front 242,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4828,"
This Belgian bund's bad reputation isn't a simple function of safe-and-saners' deplorable tendency to brand powerful art they don't like fascist (viz. Albert Goldman on the Rolling Stones, 1969). In a time that demands consciousness, mobilization, taking sides, apolitical objectivism is objectively, comme on dit, reactionary. But with their stated aim of transforming received information into powerful aural images, they're aggressive-passive as opposed to passive-aggressive. The worst you could say of them is that they'd try to make their way no mater who took over--and become antifascist six months too late. As far as they're concerned, of course, the worst you could say of them is that their club and cult hits ""Masterhit"" and ""Quite Unusual"" don't exactly carpet-bomb the sensorium. But they don't.

Beats being what they are to street music, these guys were the brains as well as the muscle behind the two most unstoppable street records of the year, and a major-label debut is their reward. Good beats abound, of course, and with the help of major muscle one of the great ones--if not ""Alice, I Want You Just for Me!"" maybe ""Half a Chance""--might make it down to the streets.

This is as confusing and promising and ultimately ambiguous as the catchy (and rhythmic) title slogan. Is that ass as in ""shake your ass"" or ass as in ""save your ass""?  And does one escape/transcend the dollar by renouncing the material world or by accepting one's lot? Similarly, are the scratchy organ timbres and disorienting separations fuckups or deliberate alienation effects? Is this music to stand to or music to get wasted by? In short, is this band (this black band, I should add, since it's black people who are most victimized by antimaterialist rhetoric) promulgating escapist idealism or psychic liberation? Or do all these antinomies merely precede some aesthetic synthesis? One thing is certain--the only place that synthesis might occur here is on ""Funky Dollar Bill.""

FALSE,B-,Peter Gabriel,Peter Gabriel,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6878,"
One of those records that is diminished by the printed lyrics that are its reason for being. Musically, Gabriel combines with producer Robert Fripp for alert art-rock that gets down around atonality rather than jumping into the astral-noodle soup, with Roy Bittan's romantic flourishes as welcome as ""D.I.Y.,"" a hard-rock landmark in a hard-rock year. But even though it makes you sit up when it comes on the radio, it's basically program music, designed to support words as elitist (and programmatic) as the social commentary Gabriel used to essay in his Genesis days. Remember the immortal words of Chuck Berry: beware of middlebrows bearing electric guitars.
"
FALSE,B-,Peter Gabriel,Peter Gabriel,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6879,"
After hitting a sophomore jinx with Peter Gabriel, on Atlantic, the first man of Genesis fulfills the promise of Peter Gabriel, on Atco--with pessimistic postprog art-rock minidrama rather than DIY DOR. ""Games Without Frontiers,"" a different kind of internationalism, and ""Biko,"" a different kind of Africanism, lead and finish side two rather than side one. Either he doesn't know his own strengths or he underestimates his audience--or both.
"
FALSE,B-,So,Peter Gabriel,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2736,"
Gabriel's so smart he knows rhythm is what makes music go, which relieves him of humdrum melodic responsibilities but doesn't get him up on the one--smart guys do go for texture in a pinch. Like his smart predecessor James Taylor, who used to climax concerts with the clever macho parody ""Steamroller,"" this supporter of good causes reaches the masses with ""Sledgehammer,"" which is no parody. Where is ""Biko"" now that we need it more than ever?

FALSE,B-,US,Peter Gabriel,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5875,"
His voice permanently hoarse--sounds like he's been campaigning for president since he dropped So in 1986, which in a sense he has--Gabriel deploys a multihued battalion of respected professionals into wave upon wave of overkill. Though the sonic layering isn't devoid of interest or even originality, the problem goes way beyond a grandeur that seems inauspiciously egotistical on ""his first real record of love songs""--these arrangements would obtrude into any musical event more low-key than an Olympic anthem or a massed May Day choir singing ""The Internationale."" ""Steam""'s googolgroove overwhelms its petty sexism, but ""Kiss That Frog"" wrecks a funny little idea about Pete's penis by asking it to hold up the weight of the world. And ""Kiss That Frog"" is the other fast one, plus one makes two. What you mean US, white man?

Look, all you young white people, I know fate has dealt you a shitty hand. Rent stabilization is a joke, safe sex isn't a joke, pollutants can really get you down, and forget the economy. Not to mention the decline of civility on our city streets. So if you just want to sit around and mope about it to each other, we understand. But if you're looking for a helping hand, you're going to have to reach out a little yourselves--that's just human nature. Show some get-up-and-go, crack a few jokes, like on the first song.

Garcia's willingness to strain his stringy pipes on muscular material may be a function of karmic complacency, but that doesn't mean he can't sing. His voice is as expressive as Lou Reed's or Donald Fagen's and more credible than Ry Cooder's or Robert Hunter's. The first side of this plumbs lyrics by Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, and Irving Berlin that you may never have noticed before, and Garcia's guitar spruces up the somewhat limp backing of the Marin County All-Stars. On side two, unfortunately, some other Marin County all-stars contribute songs that need another kind of plumbing.

Even though it omitted ""Inner City Blues"" while offering ""How Sweet It Is"" and ""Can I Get a Witness"" (already included on four other Marvin Gaye compilations and who knows how many Motown anthologies), I thought this might serve a function, since I find all of Gaye's '70s albums except Let's Get It On distressingly uneven. But ""I Want You,"" ""After the Dance,"" and the live version of ""Distant Lover"" are embarrassed by such stellar company. I guess when I want to hear ""Trouble Man"" I'll put on Anthology.

Especially considering how awkward Gaye can be on stage, this isn't bad for a live Motown album--the arrangements are finky, but some of Marvin's more interesting vocal quirks seem to have survived editing. Which is not to suggest that the live stuff is worth owning. ""Got To Give It Up,"" on the other hand, is his quadrennial studio masterpiece, and its 11:48 are cut up on the single. Still, I think the single is what I'd buy--while petitioning for a disco disc.

FALSE,B-,You're Gettin' Even While I'm Gettin' Odd,The J. Geils Band,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4863,"
This has always been an unnecessarily obvious pop group, and while fill-in vocalists Seth Justman and Stephen Bladd eschew illusions of grandeur, they're neither gifted nor skilled enough to dance that nuance.

Songcraft notwithstanding, I find that the (English) Beat's (debut) ska and (follow-up) panafrobeat albums wear better than their (farewell) pop album, and I'm sorry to report that Dave Wakeling's and Ranking Roger's new group turn a tendency into an avalanche. Although they've managed a unique sound within current English pop fashion, which makes do with unintrusive dance grooves instead of beat and melody, they don't break out of its rut. Their new rhythm section is no more an improvement on David Steele and Everett Martin than Wesley Magoogan was on Saxa. They place too much weight on lyrics that even when they escape modern romance simply don't deconstruct clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""As a Matter of Fact""). And the breathy expressionism of their vocals is fast evolving into affectation.

I wanted to call this the most readable album since Quadrophenia, but it's only the wordiest--two inner sleeves covered with lyrics and a double-fold that's all small-type libretto. The apparent subject is the symbolic quest of a Puerto Rican hood/street kid/graffiti artist named Rael, but the songs neither shine by themselves nor suggest any thematic insight I'm eager to pursue. For art-rock, though, it's listenable, from Eno treatments to a hook that goes (I'm humming) ""on Braw-aw-aw-aw-aw-aw-dway.""

I accept the slasher-movie defense in re the racism (and antirockism) of all attempts to stop these putative tough guys from bum-rushing the marketplace. But aesthetically the analogy is null, because slasher movies suck--exploiting and exacerbating rather than ""revealing"" or ""catharsizing,"" they're a social pathology, period. So whether the Boys are expressing their inner natures or one-upping N.W.A. and 2 Live Crew, they're sick motherfuckers. Women get offed before or during sex in three different songs, one of which runs a chorus of ""Geto Boys, Geto Boys"" in back lest the misguided distance it too far from its perps, and if the merely brutal ""Gangster of Love"" isn't about their own experiences, they don't want anybody to know it. I'm impressed by their pungent beats and vernacular. I'm glad they put Reagan in bed with Noriega. I'm sorta touched when one of them thinks to thank the first girl to lick his asshole. I admire their enunciation on ""F#@* 'Em."" But fuck 'em.

No longer deploying dolor for art points, Gibbons takes her aestheticism up an order of difficulty. From tasteful simplicity to dramatic vibrato to cracked slur to Badu-does-Holiday to ""water-coloured memories/Soft as a summer breeze"" to precision whisper to country-soul sincerity to loose-whisper-gets-busy to frail-drawl-achieves-grandeur to filtered weirdness to total mannered live bollocks of ""Candy Says,"" she and her hands-on arranger achieve whatever dramatic perspective they map out. But to what end? Gibbons's failure to leave the likes of ""And I only hear/Only hear the rain"" and ""Time is but a memory"" in her notebook suggests one limitation of her songcraft. But the selling point for her admirers is the deal breaker for me: a hard-earned refinement that by the nature of its ambition claims more universality than it has any right to.

If they hadn't covered ""My Way,"" maybe the one-worlder in me would adjust his horizons to embrace flamenco guitar and let the rest pass. But there it is, and don't riposte indignantly that ""My Way"" is a French song--that's the point. Their florid Andalusian emotionalism is Europop's cornball showbiz alternative to soul. I'll take Al Jolson, who invented something.
"
FALSE,B-,Vacation,The Go-Go's,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4870,"
Bizzers will no doubt rend their overpriced garments when this fails to follow Beauty and the Beat into Platinum City, but all its failure will prove is that you can't build a wall of sound (much less an empire) out of tissue paper. The uniform thinness of the non-Kathy Valentine songs here does clear up the mystery of why virtual non-writer Belinda Carlisle gets to play frontwoman--her voice fits the image.
"
FALSE,B-,Blast of Silence,The Golden Palominos,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4871,"
It was thankless enough conceptualizing arena-rock, so what gave Anton Fier the bright idea of adding country to the synthesis, as he probably calls it in the privacy of his own cerebration? Did he meet T-Bone Burnett at a party? Fight with Syd Straw about her roots? Or just think it would sell? Anton, get this straight: especially as you approach country, sincerity sells. Sincerity soulful, sincerity stupid, sincerity ironic, sincerity faked if necessary. Not this cold shit.
"
FALSE,B-,Shamal,Gong,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6919,"
Since the nicest melody on the second-nicest cut on this pastiche of pastiches, ""Cat in Clark's Shoes,"" is lifted in a much inferior version from Thelonious Monk's ""Brilliant Corners,"" I wonder where I can find the superior version of the theme of ""Wingful of Eyes.""
"
FALSE,B-,"Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die",Robert Gordon,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4879,"
A shame Brian Setzer beat him to it, I suppose. But given his by-now veteran status and RCA's failure to beef things up with the rockabilly ballads that have always set him apart from the other cats, this compilation has four too many words in its title.
"
FALSE,B-,We're an American Band,Grand Funk,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1436,"
If it takes me three months to decide that this is a listenable hard rock record, just how listenable can it be? Well, Todd Rundgren has done remarkable things, that's for sure--the drumming has real punch, the organ fills attractively, and Don Brewer's singing is a relief. Great single, too.
"
FALSE,B-,Walking on Sunshine,Eddy Grant,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1126,"
A Guayanese producer and one-man band, Grant gets an almost calypsonian, steel-drum feel out of his synthesizer, s well as some nice orchestral stuff. The first side is dancey and more. But the second side is thrown away. And the lyrics are quite uncalypsonian.
"
FALSE,B-,Vintage Dead,Grateful Dead,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11603,"
This resurrection from the golden days of the Haight suggests something about the value of iron pyrite when the assay office is far away. The singing is weak, the guitar work often uninspired and the recording stinky. Recent converts beware.
"
FALSE,B-,Wake of the Flood,Grateful Dead,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3644,"
Capturing that ruminative, seemingly aimless part of the concert when the boogiers nod out, which doesn't mean nothing is going on--what do the boogiers know by now? Musically, this is a deceptively demanding combination of American Beauty and Aoxomoxoa, sweet tunes mined for structure and texture--including good fiddle, which figures, and good horns, which doesn't. But the lyrics are more of the old karma-go-round, with barely a hook phrase to come away with. I remember Robert Hunter when he was making up American myths.
"
FALSE,B-,From the Mars Hotel,Grateful Dead,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6935,"
Brighter and more uptempo than Wake of the Flood (which is not to claim it's ""high energy""), with almost as many memorable tunes as American Beauty. Robert Hunter is not progressing, however--even ""U.S. Blues,"" an entertaining collection of conceits, seems received rather than found. And a Weir-Barlow song about money is just one more way for rich Marin hippies to put women down.
"
FALSE,B-,Drift Away,Dobie Gray,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6941,"
At times this long-lost '60s one-shot sounds like a black Joe Cocker--with the strain removed, naturally. His frank, unchurchy baritone works material from Nashville producer Mentor Williams for a universal country-rock whose racelessness is a real relief in a world of drawlers and twangers. But though the title hit sticks, I find its central conceit--rock and roll to soothe the soul--ultimately enervating. Enough to make me wish he's rejoin the in crowd, which after all is out by now.
"
FALSE,B-,Al Green,Al Green,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11479,"
If Al decides to turn into Otis Redding after all, we may look back at this repackaging of his earliest recordings as the beginning of a great stylist. If he decides to turn into Diana Ross, as seems at least possible, we will forget it quickly enough.
"
FALSE,B-,Love Ritual,Al Green,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6946,"
The only thing this product--compiled from his radically uneven later albums--teaches us about Green is why London left the title tune off Greatest Hits Volume II. Needed it for corporate revenge after Hi deserted the sinking ship.
"
FALSE,B-,Gas Food Lodging,Green on Red,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1457,"
They used to be fun, partly because you couldn't tell whether they knew how risibly their wacked-out postadolescent angst came across. So now they unveil their road/roots/maturity album, which extols heroic dreams and revives Americana--drunks, murderers, husbands who've ""passed away."" Fun it's not. And in addition to the melodies thinning out, as melodies will, the playing's somehow gotten sloppier.
"
FALSE,B-,The Last of the True Believers,Nanci Griffith,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2500,"
Among the signifiers jammed into the back-cover portrait are an acoustic guitar and a Larry McMurtry novel--not just a folkie, a literary folkie, from Texas, get it? Yes, we see. We see auburn hair in a French roll, white shawl thrown casually over antique flower-print dress, eyes demurely downcast. A mite precious, all told, with songs to match. Bet she reads Bobbie Ann Mason, too, but there's just no prose in her. What's amazing is that she almost gets away with it. On ""Lookin' for the Time (Workin' Girl),"" about a prostitute who can't afford a heart of gold, she does get away with it. I think it's the melody.
"
FALSE,B-,Gone Crazy,Grin,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6950,"
Didn't ""Beggar's Day"" sound better on Crazy Horse, and haven't we heard those girl-world boy-toy rhymes before? You bet. This is where Nils starts to repeat himself. Not only does the lack of a moderately interesting new lyric close off a source of pleasure, it also leaves Lofgren with nothing to sing about. Let's hope this was a rush job for his new label and warn him not to rush the next.
"
FALSE,B-,Wheatfield Soul,The Guess Who,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10839,"
This is a Winnipeg group that hit big with a white-soul ballad, ""These Eyes,"" which most of you probably hate. I love it. Nothing else on the lp is up to it, but except for one bummer cut (which of course runs over 10 minutes on the ""These Eyes"" side) it is well-played, well-sung, well-arranged, and personal without being push. Not to be confused with . . .
"
FALSE,B-,Bee Thousand,Guided by Voices,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1468,"
On most of these 20-tracks-in-36-minutes, the tunes emerge if you stick around, but they're undercut by multiple irritants. The lyrics are deliberately obscure, the structures deliberately foreshortened, the vocals a record collector's Anglophilia-in-the-shower; the rec-room production is so inconsistent you keep losing your bearings, as befits resident art-rock fan Robert Pollard's boast (which echoes Lou Barlow's, what a coincidence) that some recordings aren't just first takes but first plays, of songs he'd dreamed up since the last time the band came over. In short, this is pop for perverts--pomo smarty-pants too prudish and/or alienated to take their pleasure without a touch of pain to remind them that they're still alive.
"
FALSE,B-,Gun Sight,Gun,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11246,"
This unknown group has now released two albums which come very close to succeeding. The songs are excellent lyrically and the group's pretensions--which include background strings and jazz moves on top of a hard rock sound--usually work. But it never comes together, and my mixing expert informs me that the mix is muddy.
"
FALSE,B-,Appetite for Destruction,Guns N' Roses,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4904,"
It's a mug's game to deny the technical facility claimed by one-upping crits and young victims of testosterone poisoning--not only does Axl cruise where other ""hard rock"" singers strive, but he has a knack for believability, which in this genre is the most technical matter of all. When he melds scream and croon on the big-beat ballad, you understand why some confused young thing in an uplift bra is sure it's love sweet love. But Axl is a sucker for dark romantic abstractions--he doesn't love Night Train, he loves alcoholism. And once that sweet child o' his proves her devotion by sucking his cock for the portacam, the evil slut is ready for ""See me hit you you fall down.""
"
FALSE,B-,Alice's Restaurant,Arlo Guthrie,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10990,"
The only sin of the title tale is kindness, but even in that, Arlo presents a fetching argument for hippie unsentimentality--for he's also funny, sly, intensely moral, and quite unmoralistic. The six tunes on the other side aren't bad as tunes, but they were recorded before Arlo learned how to sing. One-sided masterpiece.
"
FALSE,B-,Washington County,Arlo Guthrie,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6958,"
Basically, Running Down the Road was about what it said it was about. As such, it was a little scary, which I liked but Arlo apparently didn't, because now he's busy finding ""a place to dwell"" and learning about Jesus. Or, to turn his only joke on this record around, putting his foot in his mouth and telling it where he wants to go. The Woody cover exposes the dark underside of cattle drives, but mostly it's roots and fenceposts--in short, the good earth. Which may be why he sounds sodden.
"
FALSE,B-,His Epic Hits--The First Eleven--To Be Continued . . .,Merle Haggard,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4914,"
Though at first this just seems sad, an objective person will admit that actually the songs are kind of memorable--in other words, not filler. He wrote most of them himself, too. But an objective person will also note that the two side-openers (and the two best tracks by a mile) both feature Willie Nelson. And wish he hadn't ruined a great stanza in ""My Favorite Memory"" with that stupid line about how she made their vacation a ball. And get kind of sick at the reactionary nostalgia of ""Are the Good Times Really Over."" And wonder whether Mrs. Hag really ended up in George Jones's bed like he claims in ""C.C. Waterback,"" and whether Hag minded, and if not why not. And get sad all over again.
"
FALSE,B-,Chill Factor,Merle Haggard,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4918,"
Supposedly a good one, and since it features an illustrated inner sleeve and six songs on one side that must be the intent. But by peaking with ""Thirty Again,"" all it proves is that his great theme is age rather than love, which of course dominates. Further proof includes the overtaxed title metaphor and a Hank Cochran copyright so bitter and direct it makes you think his women get sick of him for the simple reason that's he full of shit.
"
FALSE,B-,A Taste of Yesterday's Wine,Merle Haggard and George Jones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4912,"
What might have been a historic get-together overplays both the good-old-boy camaraderie and the cry-in-your-beer sentimentality of country's male-bonding mode. Willie Nelson's keynote tune becomes completely bathetic, and that the nostalgia and mutual self-congratulation it presages are even bearable is one more proof of Jones's genius.
"
FALSE,B-,The Band That Would Be King,Half Japanese,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1484,"
Just because Jad Fair is some kind of genius doesn't mean he benefits from the genius treatment--he needs a real producer forcing him to develop his material, not Kramer letting 'er rip. Most of these songlets--27 on vinyl, 30 on CD--go by so fast you don't notice them end, so that slow ones like ""Daytona Beach"" and ""Deadly Alien Spawn"" stand out. I bet if somebody made him sit down and work out extra verses, we'd know what the best fast ones were. Suggested pep talk: ""Think funny, Jad.""
"
FALSE,B-,Abandoned Luncheonette,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1487,"
This comes down to a nice equation of folk duo and soul falsetto group, brought together with the best vocal and production pyrotechnics a studio can afford. The music rocks with a smooth sophistication, although it can get sententious as well as popsy cute; the lyrics diagnose romantic malaise with clinical expertise and occasional acuity--""Everybody's high on consolation,"" perfect. If not too perfect.
"
FALSE,B-,H2O,Daryl Hall & John Oates,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4925,"
The bristling hookcraft and fussy funk of their crossover has never been more unmistakable, and neither has its small-mindedness. Only ""One on One,"" the album's sole seduction song, breaks the waspish music into something bigger, and while their dispatches from the sex wars might gain heart if gender-reversed (women get partial lyric credit on no less than five of them) I just don't believe ""Maneater"" was conceived with Nona Hendryx in mind.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of George Harrison,George Harrison,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6986,"
Seven of George's Beatle songs on the A side, and while the titles are impressive--""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun"" no more than ""If I Needed Someone"" and ""Think for Yourself""--the voice begins to betray its weaknesses after a while, like a borderline hitter they can pitch around after the sluggers are traded away. The solo ""bests"" on the B are remarkably shoddy--if this is all he can manage over four LPs you wonder why he has a contract at all. (Wait, let me guess.)
"
FALSE,B-,Thirty-Three & 1/3,George Harrison,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6987,"
This isn't as worldly as George wants you to think--or as he thinks himself, for all I know--but it ain't fulla shit either. ""Crackerbox Palace"" is the best thing he's written since ""Here Comes the Sun"" (not counting ""Deep Blue,"" hidden away on the B side of ""Bangla-Desh,"" or--naughty, naughty--""My Sweet Lord""), and if ""This Song"" were on side two I might actually play the record again.
"
FALSE,B-,Cloud Nine,George Harrison,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4937,"
""Gettin' old as my mother,"" right on and why not. ""Feel more like Big Bill Broonzy,"" not so fast. For one thing, the Other Beatle should know better than to risk comparison with his betters. For another, he's not ready to settle for Broonzy's audience share.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989,George Harrison,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4938,"
A simpleton, but also a genuine weirdo. Voice doubles wah-wah as surely as Robert Plant's Jimmy Page impression, and he seems genuinely troubled by evil doings here on the wrong side of the veil of maya. Not that there's anything a mere star-in-spite-of-himself can do about it, except write the occasional ditty about playing in a rock and roll band.
"
FALSE,B-,KooKoo,Debbie Harry,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=989,"
Blondie plus Chic sounded like a natural--charming klutz confronts the meaning of grace. But in the world of surfaces that both inhabit so intensely there are no naturals, and the kind of spiritual heat that might have made the bond take is rare at any depth. Lots of sharp little moments are intermittently arresting, and if both artists establish themselves as classic the strain may sound noble eventually. Right now it sounds klutzy.
"
FALSE,B-,2541,Grant Hart,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4940,"
Hart played drums and wrote catchy tunes for a trio called Hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sker Dï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
FALSE,B-,Flash of the Spirit,Jon Hassell/Farafina,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4941,"
The idea was for the exoticist to collaborate with flesh-and-blood ""traditional musicians,"" whatever that can mean in such a context. The result was to reduce Yurrup and Burkina Faso to a lowest common denominator--background music. Worse still, the aural environment neither flashes nor fuses--rather than a ""forced collision of cultures,"" it sounds like they just barely missed each other.
"
FALSE,B-,Brave New Girl,Bonnie Hayes and the Wild Combo,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4943,"
Her climactic love song is called ""Night Baseball,"" so obviously her tomboy credentials are in excellent order. Which come to think of it could be why the compassionate, catchy cool of her debut album has succumbed to the schlocky pop her (male, natch) musicians have a yen for.
"
FALSE,B-,Live at the Sahara,Isaac Hayes,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6995,"
I like Ike live because he makes fun of himself, but though I hear the patrons laughing I miss his turquoise tights. Can't even say I wish I'd been there--not in Tahoe, thanks. But the band is crisp and funky, and he does talk more on stage than on record if you can believe that, and I even find ""Rock Me Baby"" sexy myself. Not ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" though.
"
FALSE,B-,"Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs",Eddie Hazel,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1125,"
Hazel can really flick his pick, and maybe that's the problem: despite a welcome but misleading cover of ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and the assistance of his cohorts in the Funkadelic rhythm brigade, most of the time you'd think this was a David Spinozza record. Heavy it ain't.
"
FALSE,B-,Cowboy in Sweden,Lee Hazlewood,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2021,"
Hazlewood is an ""interesting"" figure, always was. A natural hipster, in the biz but not of it, pop and rock and country and just plain weird--Duane Eddy, Nancy Sinatra, and Gram Parsons is quite a trifecta. Problem is he'snever been all that good. There's a nice best-of hiding in his collected works, including the new standards collection. But his vogue transcends crass track-by-track quality controls, combining the usual convolutional one-upsmanship, a visceral distaste for roots-rock's sonic canon, and a generation of aging slackers' discovery that doing bizness needn't deaden your mind or rot your soul. If slick blues licks make you sick, Hazlewood's studio hacks and string-section dreck will be some kind of change. If you like Nancy Sinatra almost as much as Karen Carpenter, thin-piped Nina Lizell will clean away enough Janis-and-Bonnie grit. If you doubt all shows of soul, the flaccid sentimentality of ""Easy and Me"" will be one more trope as far as you're concerned. But without opening a book I can recall half a dozen unreissued singer-songwriter albums that do more with their varied conventions than this Europe-only 1970 rarity--by Thomas Jefferson Kaye, Nolan Porter, Marc Benno, Hirth Martinez, Alice Stuart, Mississippi Charles Bevel. And I shudder to think of the unreasonable claims to be made when their time comes around again.
"
FALSE,B-,Say It Ain't So,Murray Head,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11679,"
If mindless pap is your thing, this sure beats Eric Carmen. It's even slightly psychedoolic, and includes not a single Rachmaninoff cop. Hit single: ""Say It Ain't So Joe.""
"
FALSE,B-,No Talking Just Head,The Heads,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5933,"
Not as horrible as lead tracks fronted by the frontpersons of Concrete Blonde and INXS promise--in fact, once you forgive Johnette her pain, hers is actually OK. As is that of Live's Ed Kowalczyk, aping not R.E.M. or U2 but (what a dandy idea) Talking Heads, whose frontperson is otherwise much missed--for his personality, his lyrics, his inimitable guitar, his glue. Best in show: ""Punk Lolita,"" in which Tina, Chris, and Jerry back Tina, Debbie, and Johnette with results that recall no one so much as (what a dandy idea) Tom Tom Club.
"
FALSE,B-,Liquor in the Front,The Reverend Horton Heat,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5905,"
Not counting the belch-enhanced Scott Joplin closer, their best joke got lost on the way to the rack jobber: the title was Liquor in the Front, Poker in the Rear before somebody (the major label, mayhap?) took the punch line off the cover. This leaves us with a supposedly humorous male chauvinist trio playing rock-enhanced rockabilly Very Loud. College radio dogs find their mess authentic and postmodern all at once. Me, I listen in vain for a ""Dixie Fried,"" a ""One Hand Loose,"" even a ""Ubangi Stomp""--hell, even a ""Rock This Town,"" by the fabled and short-lived Stray Cats, who tried something similar in the dark ages of MTV.
"
FALSE,B-,Big Tyme,Heavy D & the Boyz,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4948,"
He's got a smooth, rhythmic delivery. He knows his beats and cliches, assigning Teddy and Marley to set the bait and his own DJ to pull in the lines. Although he doesn't always use his vocabulary very precisely and isn't above ""happy like a faggot in jail,"" he rarely pumps the boasts or sexism all the way to wack. He even samples Martin Luther King. In short, he knows the right people and does the right things. Which is never enough.
"
FALSE,B-,All in the Friendly Colours,Hedge & Donna,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10880,"
An engaging folk duo record. Includes a beautiful Jackson Browne, ""There Came a Question.""
"
FALSE,B-,The Essential Jimi Hendrix Volume Two,Jimi Hendrix,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7004,"
This one-LP follow-up surrounds the Band of Gypsys ""Machine Gun"" with the Monterey ""Wild Thing"" and the Woodstock ""Star Spangled Banner,"" a worthy conceit, and includes a seven-inch ""Gloria"" that lasts 8:47 and is spectacular for about a third of that. It also includes five whole tracks from Are You Experienced?
"
FALSE,B-,All of a Sudden,John Hiatt,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1780,"
Carpers have always claimed there was nothing underneath his gift for the hook, and now that Hiatt's finally gotten his big shot, on David G.'s label with David B.'s producer, he seems intent on proving it. Median cut length is up from 2:55 (on 1979's Slug Line) to 3:31, Tony Visconti has dehumanized Hiatt's uncommercial voice with filters that make him sound like a Hoosier Steve Strange, and even his cover photo has been reduced to benday dots. The veteran up-and-comer as overblown cynic.
"
FALSE,B-,Bring the Family,John Hiatt,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1783,"
""I don't think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever/Record this song,"" moans the wandering pro on the lead cut, which announces his intention to go get ""good and greasy"" in Memphis before subjecting himself to ""one more heartfelt steel guitar chord"" in the Music City he calls home. But now more than ever he seems to derive his idea of good and greasy from, I don't know, Joe Cocker, which only works when he makes nasty. Well-written though it may be, most of this is Ronnie Milsap's kind of thing.
"
FALSE,B-,It Happened One Bite,Dan Hicks,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7012,"
Hicks's songwriting is somewhat straightened (Joan Baez could do ""Cloud My Sunny Mood"" or ""Garden in the Rain"") but only slightly diminished on this 1975 soundtrack for an unreleased Ralph Bakshi movie (he sez). But for some reason it sounds a little . . . loud, even forceful. I should applaud this modernistic development, but instead I'm thinking that I'd rather hear Peter Stampfel (or R. Crumb) cover ""Mama, I'm an Outlaw.""
"
FALSE,B-,Very Extremely Dangerous,Eddie Hinton,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7014,"
Hinton's Otis Redding tribute goes far beyond anything ever attempted by Frankie Miller or Toots Hibbert--it's almost like one of those Elvis re-creations. The Muscle Shoals boys put out on backup, Hinton's songs are pretty good, and the man has the phrasing and the guttural inflections down pat. So what's missing is instructive: first, the richness of timbre that made Otis sound soft even at his raspiest, and second, good will so enormous that it overflowed naturally into a humor that hurt no one.
"
FALSE,B-,Words and Music by Bob Dylan,The Hollies,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11531,"
Graham Nash left the Hollies in principled opposition to this record. I fail to understand his fuss, unless he was worried about writing royalties. A good selection of Dylan songs done in a totally unexceptionable style. Anyone who likes the group will like this record.
"
FALSE,B-,Hollies,The Hollies,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7022,"
Hollies scholars herald Allan Clarke's homecoming as a return to form, but though the material is their most playful in years--the slyly circular ""Love Makes the World Go Round,"" the slyly hyperbolic ""Out on the Road""--the old lightness is gone, probably forever. I mean, soul is soul--at times the sham intensity here is almost baroque. We are not charmed.
"
FALSE,B-,Loleatta,Loleatta Holloway,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7023,"
Those craving a big-voiced r&amp;b singer should probably grab this rough-edged Philadelphia-type production. Those in control of their urges should note that nothing else on the album matches the lead cuts on each side, ""Hit and Run"" and ""Ripped Off.""
"
FALSE,B-,Rupert Holmes,Rupert Holmes,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7024,"
In another time this guy would be writing short stories for Collier's; if he really is a civilized Randy Newman, as some seem to feel, then the emphasis is on the civilized. The giveaway is the voice, devoid of feeling or even eccentricity, and hence inoffensive. Randy Newman is never inoffensive. That so many putative rock critics mistake Holmes's deftness for the real thing only proves how desperate we have become for original intelligence, no matter how shallow.
"
FALSE,B-,Soulful Tapestry,Honey Cone,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7027,"
Just as Sweet Replies repeated two cuts from the dud debut Take Me With You, this one repeats two from Sweet Replies--only not verbatim, which must make it all right. Wish they'd improved ""The Day I Found Myself,"" rearranged and lengthened at a slower tempo, and ""Want Ads,"" dulled with a bassier mix and stretched with orchestral break and vocal coda. I do like ""Stick-Up,"" by ""ABC"" out of ""Want Ads,"" and ""One Monkey Don't Stop No Show,"" by ""La Bamba"" out of ""Come a Little Bit Closer."" But I don't like ""Monkey"" so much I want the encore. And filler is filler, even Dozier's and Holland's.

FALSE,B-,Volume One,The Honeydrippers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4971,"
This meeting of the immortals--I refer of course to R. Plant, J. Page, and A. Ertegun, not the less than obvious r&amp;b classics they, to borrow one of the quaint titles, ""rock at midnight""--looks like the largest selling EP in history. It's not unlistenable, but I'll tell you who to buy first: Ray Charles, Roy Brown, even Phil Phillips. And Led Zeppelin--definitely Led Zeppelin.

FALSE,B-,Honk,Honk,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7028,"
Funky California eclecticism in the grateful tradition of Stoneground, with the difference in names indicating a gain in irony and the forced jollity of ""Gimme That Wine"" exemplifying the limitations of the style. Bonnie Koloc award for authenticity through cleanliness: Beth Fitchet, ""Oh Daddy Blues."" Jack Tempchin award for outwriting the principals: Mark Turnbull, ""Mademoiselle.""

FALSE,B-,Mars Needs Guitars!,Hoodoo Gurus,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4973,"
This is tuneful enough if you give it more of a chance than it deserves, but it's no fun because it's not funny. Without a few sly laughs they're just a macho pop band, which is less than you can say of the Fleshtones, the Nomads, presplit Squeeze, or prime Mental as Anything, to name just four.
"
FALSE,B-,Magnum Cum Louder,Hoodoo Gurus,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4974,"
One of the enduring kicks of college radio's minor-league ""underground"" is young believers and venerable adepts extracting something fresh from the same old fours. One of its nagging annoyances is headstrong faithful and professional guitarists claiming that competent variations on the truths they hold to be self-evident are brand new fun.
"
FALSE,B-,The Way It Is,Bruce Hornsby and the Range,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4977,"
Schlock has roots, too, which is why sentimental bizzers hail this mildly surprising platinum-plus debut as the second coming. Hornsby roughs up a piano that's more Elton John than Floyd Domino with a voice on the boogie side of country-rock and adds sometime folkie David Mansfield to songs that divide the same way--they sound like pop and read like something closer to the source. Title tune was my guilty pleasure of 1986 because what makes me feel guilty is succumbing to the blandishments of liberalism. The rest I don't have much trouble fighting off.
"
FALSE,B-,"Lies, Lies, Lies",Bill Horwitz,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7032,"
Like most topical singer-songwriters, Horwitz succumbs to the obvious (calling him Henry Kiss-of-Death isn't much of a punch line), the rhetorical (the word ""bosses"" in ""Father,"" which almost manages to bridge the generation gap through class feeling, suggests the Daily Worker rather than a daily worker), and the simplistic (equating the Army Corps of Engineers with the Czar's cossacks does injustice to both). But unlike most topical songwriters, Horwitz also has brushed with wisdom (the post-utopian revolutionary commitment of ""Sadness""); he sounds fresh because he is. As an anticapitalist, Horwitz figured taking his tapes to the big record companies would be a waste of time, so I can't fulminate about why this is on ESP Disk' while Richie Lecea is with RCA and Myles &amp; Lenny record for CBS. But given the courage of the record companies in these ledger-conscious times, he was probably right.
"
FALSE,B-,Yellow Fever,Hot Tuna,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7036,"
When this band went pro--and electric--my initial reaction was annoyance. I figured that at least when they were going country blues the material justified their deliberate pace. But that soon passed, and for years now I've been shelving their records without comment not out of anger or even dislike but in the simple absence of anything interesting to say. When a group maintains such a level for five years, however, its uninterestingness becomes noteworthy in itself. Think of it--kozmic blooze and negative vocals boogieing on into a countercultural time that knows no past or future, outracing the Starship on automatic pilot. Quite impressive, actually.
"
FALSE,B-,Dare,Human League,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4985,"
It's not flesh-and-blood chauvinism that puts me off Britannia's hookiest dance-synth monster. I'll boogie to the right machine; I can even imagine fucking a cyborg. But while the cyborg of my dreams would keep it light, not act too impressed with the tricks stored in his/her memory, League spokesman Philip Oakey comes on like three kinds of pompous jerk. The only time I light up is when Susanne Sulley takes her verse on ""Don't You Want Me,"" which I recommend to Quarterflash.
"
FALSE,B-,Look for the Silver Lining,Alberta Hunter,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4988,"
Since wonders of nature make bad records just like anyone else, what's amazing is that the flat writing, corny sentiment, and automatic mannerisms that bring this down barely touched the two before it. And don't be surprised if she celebrates her ninetieth by coming back yet again next time.
"
FALSE,B-,All-American Alien Boy,Ian Hunter,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7041,"
The concept fails. Hunter isn't even a one-star generalizer, and he obviously lacks that rare knack for the political song, though the bit about needing both the left wing and the right to fly is sharp (and scary). Yet the attempt at protest is gratifying, at least as honest as it is confused. At odd moments the music kicks a line like ""Justice would seem to be bored"" all the way home; ""Irene Wilde,"" a throw-in about young love, is a small treasure; and ""God (Take 1)"" is nice Ferlinghetti-style doggerel. So while I can't recommend, I kind of like.

FALSE,B-,Slidewinder,J.B. Hutto & the Hawks,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7045,"
Hutto boogies easy as falling off a barstool--he's kept my body interested in a slide solo for fifteen minutes at a time. So I had hopes he'd be one artist who'd thrive in a four-songs-per-side format. But compared to 1968's six-songs-per-side Hawk Squat!--with Sunnyland Slim's keyboards and Maurice McIntyre's sax filling in the sound--this is pretty slack.
"
FALSE,B-,Between the Lines,Janis Ian,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7046,"
In this time of dearth, it's probably improvident to laugh at someone so talented--good melodies abound here, and I can't think of a rock singer who has made more unaffected and pleasurable use of her or his voice lessons. But this woman's humorlessness demands snickers. It was one thing for society's teenager to pity herself because she didn't have the integrity to stick with her black boyfriend. It's another thing for a grown-up to pity her teenaged self because she was always picked last in basketball. I mean, face it, Ms. Ian--you're short.
"
FALSE,B-,Aftertones,Janis Ian,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7047,"
Ian here establishes herself as the most technically accomplished popular vocalist of her (post-rock? post-folkie? pre-Vegas?) generation. She's even managing to curb the melodrama, as well as permitting herself unaccustomed glints of humor. But if you want to glimpse the crippling intellectual limitations of this sort of accomplishment, just get a load of her library, thoughtfully depicted on a cover that also features an open aerogram and an enigmatic mirror-as-window through which peers the artiste. There they stand, all her sources: a Modern Library Camus, The Second Sex, The Greenwich Village Bluebook, How to Survive in the Woods, and that encyclopedia of secondhand angst, Colin Wilson's The Outsider. How existential. One thing, though--mirrors are good windows only when surviving in the woods isn't something you ever have to think about.
"
FALSE,B-,Amerikkka's Most Wanted,Ice Cube,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1586,"
Musically it's as original as A Tribe Called Quest, and probably doper: with Eric Sadler thickening the mix and the vocalist bluntly banging the tracks home, it delivers the hard beats N.W.A's claque clamors about, not just for a few sucker punches but from beginning to end. Lyrically it's as piggy as it wants to be: despite his gift for rhyme and narrative, Ice Cube's politics revert to victim-of-a-racist-society belligerence except maybe on the willfully perverse (and hateful) ""The Nigga You Love To Hate."" It was inevitable that some black misogynist would elevate his problem into an emblem of outlaw status. But I say fuck the muthafucka, stay on his dick, etc.--anybody who's thinks it's cute to dub himself ""the bitch killer"" is armed, extremely dangerous, and fair game for the pickle jar.
"
FALSE,B-,One Sacred Chicken to Go,Imus in the Morning,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11432,"
Souvenir with a difference. As WNBC radio's morning man, Imus is attuned to a kind of off-the-wall ear comedy that translates well to record. As a deejay, he is genuinely outrageous--he recently announced the time an hour later than it was for an entire show--and the tapes that capture his on-the-air bravado work best here. Other bits seem designed only to prove that he can use naughty words when he's not broadcasting.

FALSE,B-,Wavelength,Insect Surfers,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5007,"
Ah, suburbia, synthesizing information overload into unheard-of pop combos native to everywhere and nowhere. Take these presumptive civil service brats, for instance. Why, they cram Commie propaganda, a Wire cover, Europop, electro-DOR, and of course surf music onto one eight-song, twenty-five-minute, $5.98-list ""EP."" But the only cut that'll be heard of again in my house is the revealingly entitled ""Fascination With the Neon.""
"
FALSE,B-,Have a Good Time (but Get Out Alive),Iron City Houserockers,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5009,"
Although Springsteen has his imitators--take a bow and pose for the trades, Johnny Cougar--you'd expect there'd be more. Maybe would-be up-and-comers have figured out that his sales don't match his status, or maybe integrity on that scale seems too much like work. Integrity doesn't scare Joe Grushecky, or work either, but the scale escapes him--he's less a competitor than a slightly self-conscious soul brother, shorter on talent and longer on roots. His best songs are about bars. His most revealing song is an honest if off-kilter disco-sucks anthem--called ""Blondie,"" it's about how he and Angela can't get in where they're playing her song any more, as if this is somehow her fault, and as if they're not still playing her song in places he can get in.
"
FALSE,B-,The Isleys Live,The Isley Brothers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7059,"
""Featuring Ernest Isley on Lead Guitar,"" says a sticker on the back, and that's the pitch for these (slightly) extended remakes, their last album before moving to CBS. Problem is, all that makes Little Brother a Hendrix heir is that unlike most soul-trained guitarists he doesn't merely support the vocalist--he's loud, slow, dramatic. I prefer him to Robin Trower, say--fewer chops, apter context. But they really ought to let him do his thing in the studio.

"
FALSE,B-,All for You,Janet Jackson,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6253,"
Fifth time through or so, having vaguely enjoyed the title tune's thirdhand chic and patted my figurative foot to two other early songs and conceived something a little more fattening when she invited/implored me (me--we hardly know each other, but hey) to ""taste"" her, I got to the Carly Simon duet again, and finally it hit me. This wasn't just weird, it was revolting. Once Janet was a repressed young thing discovering her sexuality, and that was fun for everybody; now she's a rich 35-year-old demanding sex, and even if her body wisdom is manifestly subtler than Carly's, the thrill is gone. And then there's a fabled production team that has achieved precisely nothing on its own since she turned into something slinkier and more carnivorous than a cash cow--a cash mink, say.
"
FALSE,B-,Let's Get Serious,Jermaine Jackson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5024,"
For a while, the jumpy drive and axiomatic simplicity of the Stevie Wonder-composed and -produced title track got me into the skittish banality of the others (including the two Stevie ballads). Now I recommend the single, seriously.
"
FALSE,B-,Jermaine Jackson,Jermaine Jackson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5025,"
An educational contrast for those who scorn the synthetic sheen of Thriller and Victory, this label debut by the Jackson who's a Gordy is so generic it seems cloned. Not that the fast poppers aren't fun in their mechanical way. But Jermaine's singing is devoid of idiosyncrasy. His short-lived ""new-wave"" bent surfaces as the nagging predictability of the catchy-catchy-catchy hooks/beats/riffs. And the songwriting is farmed out to such El Lay stalwarts as Michael Omartian and Andy Goldmark except on two cuts, one of them the utterly sincere, utterly bathetic ""Oh Mother."" Oh brother.
"
FALSE,B-,Night and Day,Joe Jackson,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5029,"
Every musical era generates its Paul Simon, I suppose, and though this one does avoid that literary patina, his sudden (and no doubt sincere) attraction to salsa has the same secondhand aura. Decent, intelligent sentiments decently and intelligently expressed.
"
FALSE,B-,Body and Soul,Joe Jackson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5031,"
Jackson's done it again--fabricated a creditable facsimile of somebody else's music, not jump blues this time but a brassy, Broadway pan-Gotham pastiche, sort of like West Side Story if you correct for talent differential and years elapsed. And because the new-wave Billy Joel is a role model, it's likable enough. But I prefer West Side Story, and I prefer jump-blues more.
"
FALSE,B-,Small World,Joe Jackson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5032,"
He's even more adenoidal than his worthy forebears Graham P. and Elvis C., so how come he's the one with the gold records? Must have something to do with keeping it simple, don't you think? Not that he sticks to simple subjects--the guy actually has a sense of history--but that he makes their ironies seem straightforward. And maybe he's got something--I'm not going to tell you there's any inherent truth value in bitterness or paradox. I just wish he weren't so adenoidal.
"
FALSE,B-,Music and Me,Michael Jackson,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11486,"
Having finally gotten it through my head that Michael isn't the black Donny Osmond--not only does he have a sense of natural rhythm, but he's a singer not a marionette--I listened hard and decided he's not a very good singer. Genuinely sweet and genuinely clean, when Motown provides the material. But if he's a real interpreter, I'm too old to understand where the interpretations are coming from.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Michael Jackson,Michael Jackson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7078,"
Because you can believe that their sincerity is neither feigned nor foolish, it's good in theory for children to sing romantic ballads. But in the end only pederasts, parents, and horny little girls can get off consistently on the interpretive nuances of a boy whose voice hasn't changed--the manipulation from above is simply too transparent. I love ""Rockin' Robin"" and hate ""Ben"" and find most of the rest in between. The most interesting exception is ""One Day in Your Life,"" a first-rate tearjerker that achieves just the right mix of autonomy and helpless innocence--probably because Michael cut it about a year ago, when he was sixteen.
"
FALSE,B-,Millie,Millie Jackson,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7081,"
On stage, her dress, demeanor, and delivery put across a hooker's street toughness a lot more daring than the stage toughness of Tina Turner or Laura Lee. On record, though, she remains one more funkier-than-average but basically anonymous mama. She doesn't even know what to call this album--it's Millie in the notes, (big caps) Millie (small caps) Jackson on the cover, Millie Jackson on the spine, and I Got to Try It One More Time on the label. I guess I'd prefer she try it one more time myself.
"
FALSE,B-,E.S.P.,Millie Jackson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5038,"
It stands for extra-sexual persuasion, but that's not what it means--it means he knows where her hot spots are. This is doubly inappropriate because Millie seems sick of sex. She's still convincing when she parodies sexercise or does her on-the-make impression or pleads a generic headache, but the preposterous ""Slow Tongue"" is obviously just the faked orgasm that follows the faked foreplay of the title cut. And since South Africa, she's somehow lost her feeling for the slow sermons that used to save her bleep.
"
FALSE,B-,Third Album,Jackson 5,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7069,"
The first bad sign is that the best cut on the album is a ballad. The second is that the best fast one is the tossed-off ""How Funky Is Your Chicken"" rather than a Corporation special like ""Goin' Back to Indiana"" or ""Mama's Pearl."" The third is the worst ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" I ever want to hear. Is that Jermaine or Jackie? Are we supposed to care?
"
FALSE,B-,Jade and Sarsparilla,Jade and Sarsparilla,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7089,"
If this record weren't by two women who sing love songs to each other, I'd quickly dismiss it as long on melodrama and short on melody. But the built-in societal conflict faced by two women who sing love songs to each other not only makes the melodrama more credible--conflict is the stuff of drama, right?--but is also interesting in itself, and if I were a woman who loved women I'm quite sure I'd be playing it all the time.
"
FALSE,B-,Primitive Cool,Mick Jagger,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5054,"
He grooves his overpaid pickup band, he tells Jeff Beck what to do, he writes love songs for every occasion, he doesn't even over-sing much--in short, he realizes his solo move, which beats botching it if only because the sound of a plutocrat's desperation is such an awful thing. But when I realized that ""Let's Work"" was no metaphor--that it was the plutocrat importuning his lessers to ""kill poverty"" from the bootstraps up--somehow I stopped worrying whether his ""life is trivialized."" Your choice, mister--you live with it.

Last time Gabriel Mekler went one for three as a songwriter and half-ruined his producee's album. This time he goes two for six. A ""Mekler"" tune on which Etta does nothing but moan is one of the good ones, which will give you an idea of whose contribution matters. ""St. Louis Blues"" is also a winner.

FALSE,B-,Get Up and Boogie,Freddie James,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7097,"
Just what you've been waiting for, I'm sure--another soprano crooning over another cleverly entitled dance track. And coming up next, oh my god, it's ""Crazy Disco Music."" Think it might help if the singer were male? Well, it does, quite a bit--very cute, very unusual. In fact, since he's already fourteen, very very unusual--his soprano days are numbered. Next step, he says, is to go to ""Hollywood,"" where they'll tell him to ""Dance Little Boy Blue."" Don't put your advance on it, kid.

FALSE,B-,Cold Blooded,Rick James,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5062,"
As his head continues to expand, tricks that once seemed honorably functional begin to smack of expediency, with upwardly mobile cameos throwing his shortcomings into heavy relief. Teena Marie and the latter-day Tempts he could keep up with, but on this album Smokey Robinson shows up Rick's rank sentimentality, Billy Dee Williams his cornball cool, and Grandmaster Flash his roots of clay. And the redeeming social value of ""P.I.M.P. the S.I.M.P."" trips over his fashion sense--this is not a man who should criticize his peers for dressing funny.
"
FALSE,B-,James Gang Rides Again,James Gang,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7099,"
I grant that Joe Walsh's band is more interesting than the usual power trio--because it isn't a power trio, just a trio. Walsh's guitar dominates, as is customary, but by stealth, by which I guess I mean style--rather than blasting fast he goes for country-spacey glisses that are all slide and sustain. Just wish he didn't sing that way--makes it sound like his songs are (is it possible?) guitar showcases. When's the last time my fave cut on anything was an instrumental? ""Asshtonpark,"" it's called, and it's funker than ""Funk #49.""

The Dream Syndicate in the age of metal worship, a/k/a Alice Cooper revisited. Of course, Alice didn't get this good until album three. Then again, album three had ""I'm Eighteen"" on it, and the new guys aren't humble enough to try for one of those. Or lucky enough to get one--as Alice has spent his life proving, talent didn't have much to do with it. But if they stick at it like the pros they'll be, they might land an ""Only Women Bleed.""

On ""Pass the Peas,"" ""Gimme Some More,"" and an ensemble showpiece called ""The Grunt,"" JB is conspicuous by his conceptual presence even when he's not passing, giving, or grunting. On ""Escape-ism"" he's conspicuous by his spiritual absence even though he raps through most of the track. Elsewhere he's just missed.
"
FALSE,B-,Red Octopus,Jefferson Starship,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7110,"
This is indeed their most significant record of the decade, but what does it signify? It's their first number-one album, but it sells to an audience that refuses to distinguish between production values and musical ideas. While the returned Marty Balin is the most soulful folkie ever to set voice to plastic, he remains a mushbrain--the paragon to whom he addresses ""Miracles"" is actually compared to both a river and a stringed instrument. And to call ""I Want to See Another World"" and ""There Will Be Love"" jive-ass would be to imply that standard-brand American bullshit has style.
"
FALSE,B-,Gold,Jefferson Starship,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7114,"
Though their biographies suggest no special expertise in the subject, these aging romantics sing only about love. To put their generation in kinder perspective they encourage young Craig Chaquico to play his stupid guitar. Perennially poignant Marty Balin, now departed once again, dominates this compilation like a matinee idol squeezing another year out of his profile; perennially unpredictable Grace Slick, now also departed, sounds less and less interested in providing point or counterpoint. The music isn't utterly formulaic--from their tight folkie harmonies to their John Creach phase through various oriental mysteries they've cultivated an agreeable exoticism. But it goes nowhere except the bank.

The former Pinetopper got upstaged by stablemate Otis Redding at his big recording opportunity many years ago, so now, in the spirit of fair's fair, the Allman Brothers Band (sans Gregg) give him another chance by backing him with some rock and roll (not ""Rock""). They sound great, too. Only problem is, Jenkins got upstaged for a reason--he doesn't have much of a voice.

Last time these two ganged up, Willie kept things honest, but this is Waylon's caper: Willie sings on only half the cuts, and sounds almost as full of himself as Waylon when he does. You'd never know ""Mr. Shuck and Jive"" was about Jimmy Webb himself, and Willie's own ""Write Your Own Songs"" makes you wonder whether that ""purified country"" ""music executive"" (same guy?) got on old tougher-than-leather's nerves by asking him for a few new ones. Waylon's solo turns on ""The Last Cowboy Song"" and ""The Old Mother's Locket Trick"" are the giveaway--the idea is to acknowledge that all this outlaw myth is shuck-and-jive and then make the shuck-and-jive itself seem mythic. But despite some distinguished tunes, only their duet on ""Dock of the Bay,"" which has nothing to do with anything except its own lazy self, does the trick.

Success didn't lighten them up, but failure straightened them out--this is the hard-driving stuff preferred by all but the true gloom addicts in their target audience, with the gloom taken care of by lyrics about drugs, death, or both. It's as if they live in the glam-metal netherworld, only ever so much more tastefully--they flaunt no groupies, solos, or stupid fashion statements. If you've always had your doubts about their shtick, chances are you'll find the loss of aural mystery fatal.

Ian Anderson is one of those people who attracts admirers by means of a principled arrogance that has no relation to his actual talents or accomplishments. He does have one undeniable gift, though--he knows how to deploy riffs. Nearly every track on this album is constructed around a good one, sometimes two; play it twice and you'll have the thing memorized. But I defy you to recall any lyrics. For all his e-nun-ci-a-tion and attention to wordcraft, Anderson can't or won't create the impression that he really cares about love/friendship/privacy, which I take to be his chief theme--the verbiage isn't obscure, but he really does make it hard to concentrate. I'm sure I hear one satirical exegesis on the generation gap, though.

No way does the sex on this concept album recall Prince or Marvin Gaye--spiritually, its precursors are Kiss and Judas Priest. Rather than lust between equals, it's powerful men manipulating starstruck girls. And since the backstage adventure with the lawsuit attached somehow goes unrecounted--supposedly, DeVante pointed a gun while K-Ci felt the complainant up, with both love men pleading guilty to less specific charges--only a fool would take their word about how knowing their honeys are. So here's hoping your mama didn't raise no fools. And here's hoping this papa didn't either.

Having concealed his egotism in metaphor as a young songpoet, he achieved success when he uncloseted the spoiled brat behind those bulging eyes. But here the brat appears only once, in the nominally metaphorical guise of ""the stranger."" The rest of Billy has more or less grown up.

From the straight-up hubba-hubba of ""You May Be Right"" to the Rick Wakeman ostinatos of ""Sometimes a Fantasy"" to the McCartneyesque melodicism of ""Don't Ask Me Why"" to the what-it-is of ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me,"" it's all rock and roll to him, but to me it's closer to what pop meant before ironists and aesthetes, including yours truly, appropriated the term. Closer than any skinny-tie bands, that's for sure: gregarious, shameless, and above all profitable. Of course, if it doesn't make up in reach what it lacks in edge, ironists and aesthetes needn't notice it's there. And beyond ""Sleeping With the Television On,"" I couldn't tell you thing one about side two, which I just played three times.

Between the cardboard leatherette jacket and the cold-type rotogravure souvenir booklet is a piece of plastic with good melodies and bad Westerns on it.

For three straight albums this second-generation band, named after a Chuck Berry song by Spirit keyboard man and hard rock stalwart Jay Ferguson, has hung tough enough to attract my attention, but despite their high-speed, cross-riffing structural facility they haven't played smart enough to hold it. ""At the Spa,"" a nasty metaphor about the limits of entertainment, almost changed that. But in the end I find their oddly un-Californian rock cynicism almost as wearying as the other kinds.

There's a reason rhythm--and not the subtle stuff: beats stated and elaborated, on percussion instruments per se or string and electronic instruments deployed percussively--looms so large for us in the music of darker-skinned foreigners who don't sing in English. Romance of the primitive not required--rhythm is where the music is, and the meaning. For non-Lusophones, this brave Brazilian favelado--who has a record out here because he's a beguiling musical presence in the minor The Life Aquatic, not because he's a commanding dramatic presence in the major City of God--is selling timbre even when he sings an Elvis trifle in the original Leiber, and timbre isn't enough.

""What would `L'Ecriture Feminine' sound like as music?"" the once and future Kathleen Hanna asked herself, and if this is the answer we're in trouble. It sounds like Calvin Johnson prattle, it sounds like she needs all that sound equipment she can't afford, it sounds like she took her bat and went home. It's fine to reject confessional for narrative if you have some fictional craft, fine to let machines do the playing if you can figure out how to make them sing, but so far Hanna doesn't and hasn't. Instead she takes the obscure rants that were so compelling at Bikini Kill decibels and murmurs them into her cheap mike at two in the morning, if we're lucky to one of the simple tunes that provide meaning in a band context and relief in this. ""I don't expect people to like it or anything,"" she told some zine, and here's hoping they don't. She's 29, and she needs to move on.

Although I've never thought of her as a crucial funk artist, without her usual quota of popping bass and mother-popcorn guitar her pop is soft.

The Stevie Wonder-composed title track isn't blues or even soul--it's one of those slow, funky grooves that smolders along for minutes before you notice you're dripping from the heat, and it almost justifies the lame idea of sending King into Sigma Sound with Dave Crawford. Elsewhere King sings indifferent songs sincerely, recites a poem he wrote, and plays his guitar when he gets the chance.

Old Chess man Esmond Edwards acquits himself with honor--the charts are sharp, the sidemen prime, and most of the songs good ones. But the mildness of the two Muddy Waters covers reminds us that King conceived his style as progressive from Muddy's Delta-Chicago gutbucket, and the segue from ""Mother Fuyer,"" the dirtiest traditional blues in the repertoire, to Bill Withers and Brook Benton is disorienting rather than revelatory.

Forget Jerry Garcia, Robin Williamson; hell, forget Laura Nyro and Melanie. Pop's ultimate hippie isn't some sagaciously addled bohemian-for-life. It's this Brill Building alumna--she can afford it. A fireman's daughter who married her lyricist before she was one-and-twenty and divorced him before she was too old to trust herself anymore, she proved she wasn't born to follow by producing an enduring monument to you-do-your-thing-and-I'll-do-mine and then sank into the quicksand of live-and-let-live. I had hopes she'd pull out by returning to her ex-husband's lyrics, which combined commercial pith with a foretaste of the benevolent-to-cosmic truisms to come. Unfortunately hippie simplicity demands a bad faith foreign to the Shirelles, who always knew they were in show biz. While her versions of Goffin-King's late hits for the Byrds and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears come naturally enough, she can't do ""Chains"" or ""The Loco-Motion"" straight. At her best, she condescends kindly like the Bowie of Pin Ups. At her worst, she half-swings 'em, like a folkie gone jazzie, or Bobby Rydell at an oldies show.

To call this progressive rock is only to prove the term an oxymoron. But if you don't insist on snappy tunes with a good beat there are quite a few textural and technical attractions here, and the cold (not cool) jazziness of their compositions does project a certain cerebral majesty--third stream that deigns (rather than fails) to swing. Unfortunately, neither Gordon Haskell nor (keep off the weeds) Jon Anderson delivers Pete Sinfield's overwrought lyrics with the sarcasm they deserve.

Unburdened by any natural predisposition to play it again, I'm an unusually unbiased judge: side two again demonstrates Robert Fripp's rare if impractical gift for sustained instrumental composition in a rock context.

Although ""Lola"" was an astounding single, the only astounding thing about this album is its relentless self-pity. The evolution of Ray Davies's singing from raunch to whine is now complete; the melodies are still there, but in this context they sound corny rather than plaintive. It's one thing to indulge your nostalgia re village greens, another to succumb to it all over a concept album about modern media. N.b.: bookkeepers, song publishers, union reps, and musimoguls aren't all like rats. Key line, from ""Got To Be Free"": ""We've got to get out of this world somehow.""

Many are impressed by the fact that Davies's characters (yes, folks, another dramatic work here) have taken on an extra dimension, but I say that only makes two. He's finally figured out a way to integrate the horns and the girlies--sloppy Weill and sloppy madrigal on top of the sloppy rock and roll, all very lovable--but that's not enough.
"
FALSE,B-,Sleepwalker,The Kinks,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7214,"
Ray Davies's temporary abandonment of theatrical concepts may have ruined his show, but it's freed him to write individually inspired songs again. It's also freed his band to play up to its capacity, which unfortunately falls midway between professional virtuosity and amateur fun. Doubly unfortunate, at least half the songs are in a similar range. Recommended: ""Jukebox Music"" and ""Full Moon.""
"
FALSE,B-,Low Budget,The Kinks,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3678,"
Ray Davies hasn't rocked so hard since his power-chord days in the mid-'60s, and often he shores up sloppy burlesques like the title cut just by trying harder. But I don't find his poor-mouthing crassness--the fusion of syndrum and macho-flash guitar on ""Superman"" or the schlock hooks from ""Jumping Jack Flash"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar""--at all charming, and anyone who detects irony in ""Catch Me Now I'm Falling,"" his threnody for ""Captain America,"" is too worried about the ayatollah or the Russkies to think straight. With his ceaseless whining about strikes and shortages, the plight of millionaires and the cruelty of prostitutes, Davies has turned into the voice of the middle-class ressentiment he's always been a sucker for. No, Ray, you don't have to be a superman just to ""survive."" Especially if you've got a song catalogue.

I didn't attend the seven-album output reduced here to two discs with the care due a legendary songwriter--the ""survivor"" in him swallowed the songwriter years ago. His anomalously autumnal U.S. ascendancy was a disaster--attitudes forgivably eccentric in one of the great dotty Englishmen turned ugly and mean, and tunecraft so delicate it threatened to waft away on the next zephyr assumed an unbecoming swagger. The title tune was his biggest hit since 1964 because it's a perfect pop sentiment. Second-best is by Dave Davies, not Ray: ""There's no England now,"" he opines, which explains a lot.

There are those who regard this concert double as a de facto best-of that rescues such unacknowledged hard rock classics as ""Deuce"" and ""Strutter"" from the sludge. There are also those who regard it as the sludge. I fall into neither category--regret the drum solo, applaud ""Rock and Roll All Nite,"" and absorb the thunderousness of it all with bemused curiosity.

Those who dismiss them as unlistenable are still evading the issue: they write tough, catchy songs, and if they had a sly, Jagger-style singer they'd be a menace. But they aren't a menace, my wife and my sister assure me; the kids get off on the burlesque. Does this mean that when the cartoon hero in the platform shoes bellows an order to grab the rocket in his pocket all the twelve-year-olds are aware that this is a caricature of sex, and macho sex at that?

Cognoscenti I know tend to couch their belief that this is the Anticlash in purely technical terms--harmonies treacly, production punched up, and so forth. Bullshit. I too find them unattractive; if they felt this way about girls when they were unknowns, I shudder to think how they're reacting to groupies. But if they're less engaging musically than, say, the Scruffs, they have a lot more pop and power going for them than, say, the Real Kids. In other words, ""My Sharona"" is pretty good radio fare and let's hope ""She's So Selfish"" isn't the next single. Face it, this is a nasty time, and if the Stranglers are (or were, I hope) Sgt.

Or does she transcend her material after all? This is a typical Motown exploitation, comprising two strong songs that should have been on Neither One of Us plus manufacturer's seconds. Yet her moral seriousness loses none of its weight, and there's something in her voice, a hurtful rough place the honey missed, that makes me want to listen through the humdrum dynamics of the tracks.

The reflectiveness of her interpretations has never extended to her choice of material--the honest journeywoman in her must prefer contract songwriting. So she does what she's always done over ""contemporary"" settings that don't clash or mesh or otherwise call attention to themselves. Amid the various shades of schlock and dancy compromise, the best songs are those she wrote with her coproducers, Sam Dees and Bubba Knight, and the only notable one is ""Strivin',"" the most straight-up bourgie boogie since ""Bon Bon Vie.""

They're not very hooky, they're not very funny, they play guitar but not very well. Their rhymes convey no passion for language or human experience.

After a bland follow-up complete with standard singer-songwriter covers, this fulfills perhaps half the promise of her more attractive pretensions. Her songs drift off into their own imagery, and I've caught her rhyming ""warm"" and ""morn,"" but she has more to say about her father than Judy Collins and more to say about snakes than Alice Cooper. Her melodies are durable. And the cleanliness of her voice is saved from antisepsis by a cornfed openness that has Waterloo, Iowa, written all over it.

FALSE,B-,At Her Best,Bonnie Koloc,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7232,"
Her most consistent album to date is marred by chummy material (who is David Van Delinder and why did she release his ""Roslyn"" once much less twice?), half-assed commerciality (two is one too many Jim Croce songs), and dumb experiments (arting up Jackson Browne is carrying grass to Topanga). Fortunately, it's also marked by a goodly selection of her more consistent originals--the eighty-percenters is how I think of them--as well as the definitive version of ""You're Gonna Love Yourself in the Morning"" (not to mention Jim Croce's ""Hard Way to Go""). But the real reason I continue to listen through the bad tries is that she sings the way Lily Tomlin has always wished she could.

The least embarrassing LP either had made in years is a testament of what just might be a fairly interesting marriage.

This twenty-song mix-and-match isn't even monumental in theory, because two of these ""kings and queens of country music"" haven't earned their crowns--BL is a rock and roll princess who never really graduated, KK a frog ditto. But BL is also a pleasing bedroom-voiced journeywoman who turns in half of a surprisingly definitive ""You're Gonna Love Yourself in the Morning."" The other half comes from WN, who's on nine cuts and sounds like he's thinking even when he also sounds like he's asleep. DP teams with WN on a surprisingly definitive ""Everything's Beautiful in Its Own Way,"" but sounds more at home on the album's two utter unlistenables--""Ping Pong,"" in which DP at her cutesiest is outdone by KK at his klutziest, and ""Put It Off Until Tomorrow,"" in which DP kisses KK's warty little head and he croaks back.

There are obviously significant political differences between Fela and the musician he most resembles, James Brown--JB has never been imprisoned for his egomania, which is the least inflammatory construction that can be put on why Fela is in jail at this moment. More likely it's the ingrained defiance of the Nigerian government voiced (though my pidgin isn't so advanced that I get all the details) by the three songs he squeezes onto this live double. That's right, three songs--like JB, Fela is a true son of vamp-till-ready. Unfortunately, since he's not a world-class saxophonist or singer, and since his touring unit is long on brass and short on things to hit (one conga total), eighty minutes of steady but not quite uplifting groove punctuated by interesting horn arrangements is what you get.

In which Lanois adapts the all-embracing New Orleans groove to new age--not soft or lite or adult contemporary--rock. It has that intellectual aura, you know? Contemplating the human condition in sound as well as folkish words and melody, the mild-voiced Eno crony pieces together compositions that are half song, half ""atmosphere"" (as in ""The atmosphere for this goes back a few years""). And tops them off with just you guess--""Amazing Grace,"" dummy.

FALSE,B-,It Ain't Where You Been,Latimore,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7257,"
Like Barry White, Lattimore is the strong talkative type--never jabbering, never letting up on the line. Unlike Barry White, he sings with enough variety to keep the backing to five basic pieces. Like Barry White, he tends to repeat himself.
"
FALSE,B-,True Colors,Cyndi Lauper,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5352,"
Cheap sentiment plus star-budget video make the first side so disheartening that the second isn't much more than a relief. Just as the sensitive relationship songs retreat from the perils of triads and the pleasures of jerking off, ""What's Going On"" is a nostalgic generalization after the first album's confrontation with capital. Girls just want to have money--and no fun changes everything.
"
FALSE,B-,In Flight,Alvin Lee,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11513,"
Considering that this live double-LP might well have consisted of eight or nine speed-rapt blues solars and a couple of shorties, it is a triumph of discipline, and Lee's countryish r&amp;b renderings do no dishonor to the memory of Elvis Presley. But his own compositions lack bite, and the covers are never more interesting that the originals. Elvis's most always were.

FALSE,B-,Vindicator,Arthur Lee,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7261,"
As the brains behind Love, the Los Angeles equivalent of the Velvet Underground in both critical and commercial clout, Lee majored in popsong and minored in instrumental excursions of unusual long-windedness. On this record his brush with Jimi at the time of False Start seems to have fused these two interests. At its worst--which is nowhere near as bad as the second side of Da Capo--Lee elaborates Jimi's vocal style while Charles Karp strives fruitlessly to keep up on guitar. At its best--which is nowhere near as amazing as the first side of False Start--he offers readymade blues-based popsongs of undeniable drive and charm. What tips the balance for me is the only phrase that stays in my mind: ""Ooh what a dish, she smelled just like a fish."" Jimi was too sweet ever to make his sexism that nasty.
"
FALSE,B-,I Can't Make It Alone,Laura Lee,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7266,"
Lee shows a lot of singing skills here--without downplaying her natural rasp she achieves a gratifying fullness (even softness), and she knows how to put her range at the service of a song's drama. Now if only these songs had some drama--the best moment is a whispered ad lib in which Lee describes a seduction play-by-play. And the title concept is a disgrace--180 degrees is too damn far to turn even if that is the way life comes out sometimes.
"
FALSE,B-,Interior Hearts,Legal Weapon,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5360,"
You look at Kat Arthur's mascara and chains and listen to the band's simple hard rock and wonder whether they're HM or punk. If Arthur were a guy, this would bode ill, but a guy she definitely ain't, so she still has Joan Jett to look up to. And like Joan Jett she's got more instinct than brains, which is why her third indie album isn't quite what her cult and well-wishers have been long awaiting.
"
FALSE,B-,Life Sentence to Love,Legal Weapon,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5361,"
Kat Arthur makes her belated major-label debut too damn late, carrying the eternal Joan Jett comparison far into love-is-pain clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The tunes are even further from Jett's best than Jett's latest, with the dark undertow that once colored Brian Hansen's music succumbing to upbeat hooks that rise out of the locomotion like blueb"
FALSE,B-,Walls and Bridges,John Lennon,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7269,"
These songs seem more felt than those on Mind Games, probably because they express personal pain rather than generalized optimism--""Bless You,"" to Yoko in someone else's arms, is a real leap. But the melodies are received, the accompaniment ordinary, and the singing disoriented. What can it be like for this ex-Beatle to trade harmonies with Elton John (who sings backup on ""Surprise, Surprise,"" just as Lennon does on Elton's new single) in the inescapable knowledge that it's Elton who's doing him the favor?
"
FALSE,B-,Rock 'n Roll,John Lennon,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1792,"
No doubt mysteries of emotional and rhythmic commitment (soul and groove) determine why this runs out of gas after ""Be-Bop-a-Lula"" and ""Stand by Me."" But it's also true that covering Gene Vincent and Ben E. King is considerably less perilous than covering Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Fats Domino, whose songs follow. Which may be why ""Ya Ya"" (Lee Dorsey) and ""Just Because"" (Lloyd Price) work. Too bad he didn't go for more esoterica--this could have been another Moondog Matinee.
"
FALSE,B-,Kamikaze,Deke Leonard,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7272,"
Man's main man has optimistic ideas about kamikaze--on the cover he's wearing a parachute in a tree. Almost like recording solo albums while you're in a group--nice to have a cushion.
"
FALSE,B-,Picture This,Huey Lewis and the News,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5371,"
The onetime Marin country-rocker and Elvis C. backer-upper is now working a working-guy variation on Rindy Ross (Quarterflash, dummy), cutting his macho strut with pop moues and knowing nods at women's lib. Though he has none of Springsteen's feeling for narrative and sings from the diaphragm rather than the gut, he's canny enough to pick good covers and writes his share of reasonable facsimiles: ""Workin for a Livin"" could be primo Bob Seger and ""The Only One"" is worthy of Geldof or Lynott if not the master. But Chris Hayes's metal furbelows soon remind you how much Huey sounds like Louie (Gramm) (Foreigner, dummy). I mean, Dewey really need one more rock pro bulling his way through options that just aren't as limited as he makes his living pretending?
"
FALSE,B-,Fore!,Huey Lewis and the News,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5373,"
Last time he said bad is bad, this time he says hip is square, and there you have the difference between a straight-shooting album and a conventional one, between one that catches your elbow and one they ram down your throat.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Jerry Lee Lewis Volume II,Jerry Lee Lewis,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7277,"
Decadence, decadence. Even at his so-called best he parodies himself, and his delight in his own insincerity seems narrow, joyless. Jerry Kennedy, formerly a model of restraint, throws on choruses, strings, horns, flutes. The nadir is the lachrymose ""Middle Age Crazy,"" about a forty-year-old ""trying to prove that he still can."" Forty-year-old Jerry Lee takes that one at about half the tempo of his manic ""Sweet Georgia Brown,"" which together with ""Chantilly Lace"" proves that he still can.
"
FALSE,B-,When Two Worlds Collide,Jerry Lee Lewis,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5376,"
The title weeper's a cut above the rest, but new producer Eddie Kilroy doesn't push Jerry Lee the way Bones Howe did on Jerry Lee Lewis. In fact, all that rescues this record from boredom and arrogant excess are two ancient throwaways--""Alabama Jubilee"" (1915) and ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie Goodbye"" (1922)--plus an obscure BMI copyright called ""I Only Want a Buddy Not a Sweetheart"" that also evokes prerock tradition. His voice is on its way out and he's lucky if his spirit shows up on alternate Thursdays, but if he wants to tell us he's a classic I'll nod my head. And pat my foot.
"
FALSE,B-,Lark,Linda Lewis,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7280,"
This convent-educated West Indian Londoner has a cute voice, all blithe and flighty, but she also wrote all twelve of these songs and produced herself at age twenty-two--beneath the little girl who likes the flowers in your toes there's a hard-headed woman who wouldn't care if your moon was in the dustbin. How hard you're willing to look for the woman--and thus enjoy the girl's deft, sprightly, folkish music--depends on your tolerance for or attraction to cute facades. Mine decreases every time I listen.

FALSE,B-,Sundown,Gordon Lightfoot,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7281,"
If Gordon had dyed his hair and taken a short course at the local car wash--you think he would have lasted a week?--he might have found a new career as Jim Croce II. Instead, he scored one of his periodic hit singles, thus securing his status as a weird new kind of purist: uncompromising proponent of commercial folk music. Two songs about the lure of the sea and one about urban despair go down as easy as the usual plaints about female perfidy. Chad lives?
"
FALSE,B-,The Last Record Album,Little Feat,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2080,"
It's no surprise that as they run out of things to say--all this adds to our insight into interpersonals is a few turns of phrase--they figure out artier ways of saying them. In fact, it's a bore. I'd recommend ""Long Distance Love"" to Wilson Pickett, though.
"
FALSE,B-,Men Without Women,Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5384,"
The lyric sheet makes good reading--the confessions of a working-class teenager who got what he wanted and lost what he had (though he would have lost it anyway by now, and had less money besides). Unfortunately, Little Miami Steve sounds like arena-period Dylan doing the Born to Run songbook, and the E-Streeters in his band blare like Silver Bullets. If the Boss really is driving around El Lay wondering what happened, as one rumor has it, he could do worse than rescue ""Men Without Women"" and ""Princess of Little Italy."" Only don't pronounce it ""Lily,"" okay, Bruce?
"
FALSE,B-,Cry Tough,Nils Lofgren,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7294,"
This one makes me feel shitty. Epic could never break his best stuff and has now topped off the disservice by discontinuing his albums. Meanwhile, over at A&amp;M, Nils begins to sound like a professional next-big-thing, the surprise of his lyrics reduced to a turn or two and his gift for pop melody subsumed by his gift for the one-man rave-up. Crying tough is playing tough, not being tough, and there was always more than toughness to Nils anyway.
"
FALSE,B-,Out After Dark,Roy Loney & the Phantom Movers,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3037,"
Loney still writes fun songs, but he forces the music, which is no fun at all. The Flamin' Groovies, meanwhile, play it so loose they damn near fall apart. Ahh, synthesis.
"
FALSE,B-,Pontiac,Lyle Lovett,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2183,"
He's another Nashville neotraditionalist who's trying his damnedest to surpass a not-bad debut, a rounder who's better off playing the husband (as in the unembittered ""Give Back My Heart"" and ""She's No Lady""), with something of Merle's jazz feel and a weakness for songpoetry (""If I Had a Boat,"" help). And he's something of a hit as he joins such succes d'estime as pure Ricky Skaggs, clean Dwight Yoakam, clear-eyed Ricky Van Shelton, straight George Strait, reborn Reba McEntire, King Shit Randy Travis, and the great Rosanne Cash in a critical-commercial conflux that recalls the chart-topping days of Beatles, Stones, and, er, Jefferson Airplane. Why isn't this more of an up? Because all it means is that the folkies have taken over the establishment again, and a piss-poor one at that--these artists often spend the better part of a year going gold. Granted, the new trend does lend credence to the old folkie claim of proximity to the hearts of the people. But it also lends credence to the old antifolkie charge of middle-class romanticism in disguise.
"
FALSE,B-,Flex,Lene Lovich,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2030,"
In the absence of a lucky hook or three, this universal expatriate is better off unhinged and pretentious (side two) than headed straight down the pop pipe (side one). Of course, in the absence of a lucky hook or three, so's Neil Diamond. Just wish I was sure the song about Joan of Arc was tongue-in-cheek.
"
FALSE,B-,Togetherness,L.T.D.,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7302,"
One thing you can figure about a funk band that gets me jiggling up and down to a song called ""It's Time to Be Real"": They must be real funky. Another thing you can figure is that their slow ones are unlikely to bring a tear to the eye or a chuckle to the lips.
"
FALSE,B-,Word of Mouf,Ludacris,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11203,"
It was ludicrous for an employee of the Fox Network, especially a lying bully like Bill O'Reilly, to criticize anyone else for coarsening public discourse. It was amusing to watch the Britney pimps at Pepsi cave first to O'Reilly and then to Ludacris, who with the help of the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network held Pepsi up for a few million to ""support the arts in communities at risk,"" a matter in which I eagerly await the Ludacris Foundation's audited progress report. Also, he raps and rhymes with gusto, and I like his Timbaland beat so much I don't want to know how real its Glocks are. Nevertheless, he is or impersonates a no-class pimp motherfucker, and if he never reached a one of the nine-year-olds O'Reilly yammers about, he would still be coarsening public discourse. Song after song pumps the pimp theory that all women are whores. Rotate good-humored dance songs in which the best thing you say about female persons is that they crave your tallywhacker and the worst is that you'll murder them if they bother, and you'll change how real human beings of both sexes think and behave. Anyone who claims different is certainly a liar and probably a bully.
"
FALSE,B-,Natural Ingredients,Luscious Jackson,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5909,"
These four estimable women exemplify the limitations of scene loyalty and good intentions. Only a killjoy would piss on their project--a friendly alternative funk that stands as a confident reproof to the usual sexual and racial caricatures. I like them fine as people, and I wouldn't even say I don't like their music. It's just that I don't, well, like their music. The ear food it provides is so scant that all you want to know about ""Energy Sucker""'s hook riff is where they found the sample, and I find it hard to believe they pack an irresistible aural buzz even for those who experience their project as a cause.
"
FALSE,B-,Machine,Machine,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7314,"
""There but for the Grace of God Go I,"" with lyric entirely by August Darnell, is irresistible musically--still the disco disc of the year. The two tracks with lyrics partly by August Darnell are mildly arresting musically. And the other four are ordinary Isleys-influenced black pop/funk/rock.
"
FALSE,B-,Absolutely,Madness,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5399,"
Just like the Specials and the Selecter, they have second album problems, with the cockneys soft-pedaling the same subject that confounds the two-toners: ""Embarrassment,"" which saxophonist Lee Thompson says was inspired by his sister's mixed-race pregnancy, sounds like it's about an arrest, or the wrong haircut. And though close attention reveals the same class contretemps and irrational fears that haunt Jerry Dammers, no American will suss these songs unaided. This may be localism and it may be songcraft, but it's probably both.
"
FALSE,B-,Raw Magic,Magic Slim and the Teardrops,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5401,"
It ain't magic because it ain't raw enough--Slim conscientiously approximates the licks and grooves of his betters without adding a thing. In contrast, his Rooster EP is a lot cruder and considerably more exciting. Which is not to suggest he could keep it up for forty minutes anywhere but a South Side bar.
"
FALSE,B-,Satisfied 'n Tickled Too,Taj Mahal,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7322,"
Better the Intergalactic Soul Messengers Band, who improvise less and back more (though unfortunately they compose more too), than the East-West Connection Orchestra, who root Taj in Philadelphia on ""Baby Love"" (no, not that ""Baby Love""). And better John Hurt's title tune and Taj's ""Ain't Nobody's Business"" than either.
"
FALSE,B-,Inner Worlds,Mahavishnu Orchestra/John McLaughlin,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7330,"
McLaughlin's return to a small group would seem overdue, but in fact he's right on time--trapped in the dead end he saw looming ahead of him way back in 1973, which is why he resorted to orchestrations in the first place. Yup, John's got himself a funk fusion group just like Jan Hammer and Billy Cobham. Stu Goldberg (come back, Jan) and Ralphe Armstrong (composer of ""Planetary Citizen"") are the sidemen, Narada Michael Walden the coauthor. Walden has better technical control of funk rhythms than a lot of jazz-oriented players, but he's squeamish about grease, and as a result his tunes tend to be cute even when they're good. McLaughlin, meanwhile, tends to be impressive even when he's repeating himself. But not that impressive.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Louise Mandrell & R.C. Bannon,Louise Mandrell & R.C. Bannon,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5406,"
In ""From 18 to 33,"" they spend fifteen years not getting divorced and live to enjoy it. The rest of their conjugal hogwash is distinguished primarily by two timeless puns--""Just Married"" (from bumper sticker to state of being) and ""Our Wedding Band"" (barroom buddies)--and, can it be, a syndrum.
"
FALSE,B-,The Good Earth,Manfred Mann's Earth Band,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7349,"
Manfred has learned just enough about the synthesizer to be dangerous, as his previous album proved, but at least this one, intended to be ""more accessible,"" improves with listening. Two songs are homely enough to justify the name of this progressive-identified intragalactic conspiracy: ""I'll Be There"" and ""Be Not Too Hard.""
"
FALSE,B-,Music Madness,Mantronix,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2237,"
The first rap act since Flash to be named after its DJ will make a believer out of you maybe half the time--Mantronik's beats have that much groove, variety, and (damn right) human touch. ""Listen to the Bass of Get Stupid Fresh Part II,"" which features a harmonica, is a minimalist tour de force. M.C. Tee, poor soul, needs boasting lessons.
"
FALSE,B-,Kids in Philly,Marah,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5830,"
Though the press kit just barely mentions Springsteen, anyone intrigued by their reviews should be aware that these young adults from Philly flatter Bruce sincerely enough to make a grown man wince. Just as banjos and mandolins overshadow synths and samples along their E Street revisited, so old-fashioned urban-sentimentalist local color like ""Reet Petite,"" Rocky Balboa, and watches that need winding warm their hearts, while indications that they still keep their eyes open--modern stuff like hazmats, Members Only menswear, ghettos ""teeming with beats that reverberate fear""--chill their very souls. They deserve a Big Man of their own.

FALSE,B-,Joie de Vivre!,Diana Marcovitz,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7351,"
This woman suffers from Don Rickles's syndrome--when she gets serious, watch out for flying horseshit. But ""The Colorado of Your Mind"" (""Go shove it up, the toochas of your mind!"") and ""Drop Dead"" are nasty and hilarious, the kind of songs that are adjudged ""offensive to our listeners"" by sensitive (male) program directors. Martin Mull should have a tenth of her spirit.

FALSE,B-,Babylon By Bus,Bob Marley & the Wailers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=389,"
Here's another one of those live doubles I'd love to love--because I still think they're a great band when it's customary to put them down, and because the night I caught was magnificent. But I prefer the studio versions of every one of these songs (including ""Punky Reggae Party,"" available as an import single). In other words, here's another one of those live doubles.

FALSE,B-,Metro Music,Martha and the Muffins,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2277,"
The subhook on ""Echo Beach,"" the club hit that brought this Canadian skinny-tie music to our attention, is perfect: ""My job is very boring I'm an office clerk."" The worst bore in the world wouldn't say ""office"" in that sentence; it's there to scan. Yet there's something endearingly gawky in the obviousness of the device. See also this confessional: ""I wish that I could be decisive/Then I'd understand where life is going for me.""

FALSE,B-,Street Fever,Moon Martin,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5418,"
Nick Lowe graduated from Brinsley Schwarz; Moon graduated from Southwind. As an authentic Texahoma native, he does up his hooks neorockabilly style, affecting a country-punk toughness that comes complete with the formal distance that's caught on in France and other distant places. He is to Nick Lowe as Southwind was to Brinsley Schwarz. There is no substance to reports that he'll join Jules Shear in a cult supergroup called Pop Pile.
"
FALSE,B-,Mystery Ticket,Moon Martin,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5419,"
Martin seems intent on fulfilling his formal promise: the hooks keep getting bigger and the beat keeps getting edgier. In fact, for a thirtyish wimp who frequently threatens to murder his girlfriend, he's quite an attractive fellow.
"
FALSE,B-,Carolyne Mas,Carolyne Mas,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7356,"
Mas is one of those folksingers who likes ""good"" rock and roll so much that she feels honored to contribute kitsch poetry like ""Snow"" and kitsch pop like ""Do You Believe I Love You"" to the genre. So I was surprised to find myself enjoying four of these songs and getting off on two, ""Sadie Says"" and ""Quote Goodbye Quote."" Only you know what? Her guitarist, David Landau, turns out to have cocomposing credits on three songs here, and they just happen to be my three favorites. Wonder how he sings.
"
FALSE,B-,Tomorrow,Hugh Masekela With Kalahari,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5420,"
The words document his losses, his struggle, his oppression as a South African exile. I learned from them, and that's high praise for any lyric. The music documents the life he wants to lead, which is as corny as any other dance-fusion jazz played by musicians overimpressed with their own chops. He has a right to that life, obviously. Just as obviously, I have a right to pursue my own life elsewhere.
"
FALSE,B-,Very Best of Dave Mason,Dave Mason,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7364,"
ABC has finally compiled a Dave Mason album as good as Alone Together by the simple expedient of omitting only the worst and longest of Alone Together's eight songs (two of which have now appeared on five of Mason's six ABC/Blue Thumb albums), adding the two live Traffic-originated tracks, and sticking on one from Headkeeper. Engaging throughout, especially compared to his Columbia stuff, and true to Mason's place in history. With his gentle, multipercussive impetus, warm but basically characterless vocals, skillful hooks, and dippy lyrics, the man is the father of California rock-pop. Loggins &amp; Messina, the Doobie Brothers, Pabo Cruise, every folkie who ever tried to swing a little, where would any of them be without Dave? Docked for wellspringing.

FALSE,B-,Tigers Will Survive,Ian Matthews,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11478,"
I know that Matthews (Fairport Convention, Matthews Southern Comfort) is one of the best acoustic-type performers around. I enjoy him at clubs. But they tell me that all the tunes on the record catch up to you, and after listening a dozen times I'm up to two--""Da Doo Ron Ron,"" which had a head start, and ""The Only Dancer.""
"
FALSE,B-,Later That Same Year,Matthews' Southern Comfort,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7367,"
This one really is pretty--except when guitarist Carl Barnwell gives him love letters to read (long-winded, too: ""Sylvie"" runs 6:08 and ""For Melanie"" 6:50), he selects very lissome melodies. And no dumb lyrics, either. But when you're so single-minded about singing pretty it's hard to convince anyone you care what the words mean.

FALSE,B-,Roots,Curtis Mayfield,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7372,"
Last time he announced his lack of ""concern or interest in astrology,"" so when the zodiac showed up as a packaging motif I began to get nostalgic for the Impressions. But though the vagueness that was Curtis's chief flaw runs rampant musically (""Love to Keep You in My Mind"" goes nowhere slowly) and lyrically (""Underground"" is one long mixed metaphor), it's not all that bad--the relaxed, natural groove of Mayfield's falsetto and his rhythm section are both seductive. Only on the lead cuts, however--especially the heavy-breathing sex opus ""Get Down""--does he sweep you off your feet.

FALSE,B-,Mac McAnnally,Mac McAnally,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7377,"
Although it does often sound pat, as folk stoicism will in a post-folk context, the first side comes across pretty outspoken for a Mississippi singer-songwriter with royalties in the bank--the heroine of one song is a rape victim who murders both assailant and judge after the latter lets off the former. Side two is Joe South.

I've finally figured out what people mean when they call Paulie pop--they mean he's not rock. But to me pop implies a strict sense of received form whether crafted by the dB's or Billy Joel. McCartney's in his own world entirely, which is the charm of his music. And of course, a reliance on charm has always been his weakness. This is quite pleasant except when Britain's number-one earner preaches against violence as if self-interest wasn't an issue, which is also the only time it comes into firm contact with the great outside.

FALSE,B-,Sunny California,Mary McCaslin,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7382,"
I could warn ya that Linda and Nicolette's prior claim on all early-'60s revivals is established conclusively on the lacklustre arrangements on ""Cupid"" and ""Save the Last Dance for Me."" But would Linda or Nicolette risk putting five of their own songs on a major-label debut? They don't even have five of their own songs.
"
FALSE,B-,A Life and Time,Mary McCaslin,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5431,"
When I fail for a fourth time to listen to a title song all the way through, I stop blaming myself and start blaming the singer-songwriter. Whose best original here, a passionately reserved exploration of the limits of gotta-move-on-babe, was written in 1969, and whose best cover, a passionately tender lesson in the limits of I-can't-trust-babe, copies an arrangement by the Dirt Band. Side-openers both, which is why I bothered with the title song.
"
FALSE,B-,Love Rustler,Delbert McClinton,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11762,"
McClinton's cult sentimentalizes bar music. The fact that bars encourage a relatively innocent functionality--pleasing a small concrete audience rather than a [ . . . ] make them any more ""authentic"" than studios: McClinton is essentially a male Texas version of Linda Ronstadt--a strong-voiced, versatile singer who doesn't seem like an especially interesting person. This means not only that he's at the mercy of songwriters and arrangements but also that he isn't likely to have very distinctive taste in either. The title cut is a classic, and several of the remakes are worth hearing more than twice, but asa whole this album is as pleasant and forgettable as a Friday night out.

The anthemic power of ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"" made me think these guys were ready to take over, but all it meant was that every year or two they write a great song. The disco disc has gone gold, and is recommended.

FALSE,B-,The Voice,Bobby McFerrin,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5436,"
He's an innovator, he's a virtuoso, he even has a sense of humor, but he's also a mite precious, not to say arty, and this unaccompanied scat demonstration encourages his formalistic proclivities. As with so many solo recitals, technical display is emphasized; fact is I've heard numerous saxophonists do more with ""Donna Lee"" and numerous drummers do more with ""I Feel Good."" One reason the voice is such a sublime instrument is that it can pronounce words, and give or take a catchphrase or two the only ones he bothers with here are his own lyrics for ""I'm My Own Walkman."" Wonder when some creative type is finally going to stick up for those of us who'd rather consume music than manufacture it.

FALSE,B-,Simple Pleasures,Bobby McFerrin,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5437,"
No matter how much aid and comfort it gives the enemy, there's no point denying ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" unless you're tin-eared enough to think it doesn't capture a feeling or deluded enough to think poor people never share it. Title tune's the real Republican lie--McFerrin's celebration of 6 a.m. wakeup neglects to mention that his morning is unencumbered by a j-o-b--and even that's probably a tragic consequence of some fundamental mindlessness. Passing as an Artist on skill and fluidity alone, he's a vocal Keith Jarrett come down with the cutes--or maybe a musical Marcel Marceau.

FALSE,B-,Cardiff Rose,Roger McGuinn,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7400,"
I'd written him off before Rolling Thunder, too, but this record, produced by fellow Roller Ronson and featuring various tour buddies, rocks wilder than anything he ever did with the Byrds. Unfortunately, it's more confusing than astonishing. The factitious folk songs about piracy and the Holy Grail make fewer contemporary connections than the real folk song ""Pretty Polly."" Ditto the previously unrecorded donations from fellow Rollers Mitchell and Dylan. Imagining how Dylan might sing ""Up to Me,"" which sounds like a forerunner of ""Simple Twist of Fate,"" you begin to miss the quavery McGuinn or yore. And the song that's actually about Rolling Thunder is pretty sickening.

FALSE,B-,Stay the Same,Joey McIntyre,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5309,"
After taking in Girls Against Boys' searing analysis of the culture-killing boypop scam in The Nation, which certainly needed the heads-up, I sought a class enemy to hit on, but the best I could do was this mildly annoying Old Kid. Featureless funk holds up an album that rode to gold on the back of the overstated title ballad. It's not even tripe--more in the line of twaddle, only less pretentious. Right, he should act his age like his ex-bandmate Jordan, and deserves the obscurity to which he will soon return. But in a world that contains George W. Bush, we're well advised to figure out at just what point bland feel-goodism becomes murder.

Dave Mustaine is earnest about his rage--at nuclear holocaust and the P.M.R.C. and lying scumbags and his own self-destructive tendencies. He covers the Sex Pistols like a champ. He doesn't boast, he doesn't preen, he allows himself but a single ""bitch"" on an entire long-playing record (she sounds very irresponsible and probably deserves it). And thus the latest well-regarded metal band gains its modest portions of profit and respect. But where's the monster guitar? Where's the angel singing like a bat out of hell? Where's the big deal? Upped a notch for meaning well.

Over sixty minutes of previously unreleased tunes or worktapes have been crammed onto twelve inches of vinyl by this since disbanded band or collective, so play it loud or it'll sound like a tree falling in the forest with no one there to hear. Which is actually the idea. As rock ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½pater les bourgeois goes, it's humane, imaginative--none of the malignant contempt of Metal Machine Music or Flowers of Romance.

But unless you're heavily into the byways of anarchist negation, most of it demands more consideration than there's any reason to expect from the ordinary harassed citizen, social worker, journalist, or record executive.

Two of which you can skip: the formless formative stuff (she's eternally callow so who needs it, though ""I Really Loved Harold"" and ""Somebody Loves Me"" are nice) and the unspeakable contemporary covers (Dylan, Taylor, and Jagger as Blake, Keats, and Coleridge). But even without ""Brand New Key"" her hits have their charms--""What Have They Done to My Song Ma"" and ""Nickel Song"" on one theme and ""Lay Down"" and ""Peace Will Come"" on the other. And except for the labored ""Psychotherapy"" the weird stuff is quite amusing. She ought to ask herself, though, why the two best cuts on her best-of are the aforementioned tune, and ""Christopher Robin,"" by A.A. Milne.

Most will find this producer's daydream sterile at best and noxious at worst, but I like the song about his shrink and am fascinated by his compulsion to defend his Manson connections. With the requisite show of wealth and taste, he insists that he's only a spectator--why, he wouldn't even know about the hand jive if it weren't for Soul Train. Alternate title: It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Watching.

He's miserable because his half-earned success gets him more love than his hard-fought principles, because he still isn't sure what justice is, because his bones creak, because he's an American fool. He wrote the 11 originals sans band for a Woody Guthrie feel, as if structure were the secret, and as rendered by said band they sound so loose-limbed that at first you may blame yourself for not loving the shit out of them. But every one bogs down in his bitter pretensions, as Mellencamp must suspect. Why else would he sneak in the devastating unannounced cover (nonvinyl-only, principle fans) of the 1967 one-shot ""Let It All Hang Out,"" where four loose-limbed fools who never heard of Woody Guthrie achieved the feel he's striving for without even trying--in hopes of becoming pop singers, yet. The loss of grace it signifies could make anybody miserable.

Ziggy Marley owes Bob for his voice and his band, and he's not just whistling ""I Shot the Sheriff"" when he thanks him for ""spiritual inspiration"" as well--without it this record would be empty, voice and band notwithstanding. What's still missing is not only his father's genius but his father's experience. Here's hoping the spiritual inspiration is potent enough to keep the kid from trying to substitute musical experience for the life kind.

I feel at a generational disadvantage with this music not because my weary bones can't take its power and speed but because I was born too soon to have my dendrites rerouted by progressive radio. This band's momentum can be pretty impressive, and as with a lot of fast metal (as well as some sludge) they seem to have acceptable political motivations--antiwar, anticonformity, even anticoke, fine. But the revolutionary heroes I envisage aren't male chauvinists too inexperienced to know better; they don't have hair like Samson and pecs like Arnold Schwarzenegger. That's the image Metallica calls up, and I'm no more likely to invoke their strength of my own free will than I am The 1812 Overture's.

The jazzy coda doesn't ruin ""Sky High,"" ""Deed to Texas"" is chauvinism at its most forgivable, and in general this is good fun. But though Meyers has grown as a singer he has nothing to add to ""Release Me,"" and though he half-earns the right to contribute seven of his own songs I bet he knows ""Baby, Baby"" is sheer filler.

Although it helps that she gets stronger material than usual from yet another phalanx of International Pop Music Community pros, what makes this Bette's best studio album in a decade is a Habana production number set in Miami, a newly written Sophie Tucker song about a driving wheel, and not-quite-comic readings of Marshall Crenshaw and Jagger-Richard. What makes it not good enough is the curse of Broadway rock and roll--the beat is conceived as decoration or signal rather than the meaning of life, or even music.

Dave Crawford, whose debut production with this group explored the spiritual affinities between showbiz gospel and studio soul, here returns to form by exploiting shared commercial asininities. Don't be fooled if they get the great exception, ""Mighty High,"" onto DJ turntables; Joe Ligon singing ""You Are So Beautiful"" is even more depressing than Billy Preston.

Chicago's Anglodisco clones meet Anglodisco renegade Adrian Sherwood and promptly improve themselves by trading in wimpy on arty.

As with so many middle-class suburban Amerindies whose music starts hazy, they're making atmosphere their vocation.

The two Joni-with-guitar/piano/dulcimer sides of this live double are impossibly tedious even though she's learned to sing songs that were beyond her half a decade ago--if she was so crazy about folkie-purist records she would have gone that way in the studio originally. The two new songs are mere bait--they wouldn't be on the album if she'd recorded them before. And the two sides with the L.A.

This double album presents a real critic's dilemma--I'm sure it's boring, but I'm not sure how boring. Insofar as it isn't, Jaco Pastorius deserves as much credit as the artiste. Just the way it did on Hejira, his bass enables her to deal with the syntheses that obsess her--melody and rhythm, form and anima. But only on the title cut does he enable her to realize them.

In one of his many clever songs, Nick Currie compares his quest for fame to God's and wonders why the big fella gets all the coverage. The answer is that God is a nicer guy. Performers like Currie believe ""all interesting behaviors, whether moral or not, are salable in our culture"" because they don't have much choice--it's that or a day job. But no matter how well-turned the lyric, very few listeners actually enjoy songs in which snobbish dandies trot out their sexual egomania and baby envy. Deep down, most people have some cornball in them. And this is a good thing.

A tuneful, hard-hitting case study in the conservatism of the ""rock"" claimed by studio hotshots wherever popular music is manufactured in our once-great land. It's possible to imagine the identical beats and licks vitalized by, say, a younger John Anderson. But mixing them with male chauvinist reaction makes more sense, and turns them rancid. At a time when female spunk has become a Nashville clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, these two putative roadhouse rats, one the brother of cowboy-hat millionaire John Michael Montgomery, inhabit a worl""rock"" because they're ""rebels,"" only what they rebel against is the present, in male-specific terms: ""They say this way of life is done/But not for my father's son."" Like their antecedent Charlie Daniels, they beg the question of whether they're also that kind of rebel. But attention ought be paid another high-profile couplet: ""It ain't nobody's business what kind of flag I fly/'Cause that's my right."" Uh-uh, stupid. The way flags work is that they're the business of everybody who sees them. That's why you fly them high--and why the other side tears them down.

Not just guitarless but wholly synthesized, with Junie's all too childish falsetto playing daddy to a smurf club, this is as half-assed as most P-Funk spinoffs even if it wastes a few more ideas.

Sententious, torpid, abandoned by God, this six-song, fifty-five minute meander is Morrison's worst since Hard Nose the Highway--Astral Weeks fans even think so. He does have a direct line to certain souls, though, and they still hear him talkin'.

In this troubled time, rock-and-rollers have every right to place their faith in the Jehovah's Witnesses or even Scientology when they discover that Jackie Wilson didn't say it all. But to follow one with the other appears weakminded, like praising Omar Khayyam in tandem with Kahlil Gibran.

This well-paced, well-pastiched ""oratorio"" might be of compelling interest to the sort of avant-garde composer whose work incorporates pop usages; after all, here we have genuine pop musicians doing the obverse. But as rock and roll it's a moderately amusing novelty record, much too obvious in its satire, with harmonies and time changes that presage Yes and Jethro Tull rather than ELP and the Moody Blues. Best cut: ""Call Any Vegetable.""

Its enthusiasts to the contrary, this is hardly the greatest rock and roll record ever to thump down the pike. It's just an artier version of the overly self-conscious mode I call stupid-rock, simultaneously gargantuan and prissy, like dinosaurs galumphing through the tulips. It would be a lot worse if it weren't so funny, but it would also be a lot less funny if it were a little better. Recommended to Stooges fans who just found a five-dollar bill.

Mowatt seems like an exceptionally decent person. Her avowals of sisterhood are a welcome corrective to Rasta sexism. But as a frontwoman she's a backup singer. The straightforward decorum of her timbre suits her fine, but her lack of inborn dramatic grace and soul technique make her modest tunes more tedious than they have to be. And I don't hear the boys in the band putting their backs into it.

An honest if rather clumsy pop country album from the Canadian who had a well-deserved hit with the title song. Her corny and superfluous ""Get Together"" is more than made up for by (believe it or not) the best cover version of ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight"" I know, and if ""Running"" is a little stiff, you tell me how many other pop country artists sing the praises of draft dodging.

FALSE,B-,I'll Always Love You,Anne Murray,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7490,"
Murray's third album with Jim Ed Norman continues her gradual revitalization. Norman does clean, honest, Nashville-quality work, Murray gives forth with the old sensible spunk, and the singles break country and cross over just like they're supposed to. But the potential a few of us perceived in her five years ago is gone. Then Murray seemed to have a shot at women's pop, in the honorific way that term was used after Warhol and the Beatles--a Canadian gym teacher who could rock and roll, a militantly ordinary audience with a lesbian fringe. Now she's just quality MOR, singing the El Lay songbook (only two Canadian composers here, one of whom is Jesse Winchester) like a down-to-earth Emmylou, or Linda without charisma. Which means that exactly how good her records come out no longer matters.

FALSE,B-,Outcry,Mutabaruka,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5521,"
The man has his merits: ""Rememberance"" rallies consciousness around the grim history of black oppression, and ""Sisters Poem"" goes a healthy halfway toward opposing Rastafarian sexism. But too often he's just smart enough to be dumb. What he has in mind for the sisters is the pious pedestal of ""Black Queen."" Those pondering the Palestinian conundrum may be surprised to learn that ""Canaan Lan"" will revert to the sons of Ham come millennium time. And any well-meaning white lefty who wonders why U.S.-born blacks don't always rush into common cause with West Indians, not to mention well-meaning white lefties, should check out ""Blacks in 'Merika,"" yet another vague, patronizing, moralistic, ignorant tract imposed from yet another outside.

Nas covers his ahzz. If in one song he's ""wetting"" (lovely word) ""any nigga"" (another) his fellow playa Scarface doesn't like, in another he's fomenting revolution: ""Combine all the cliques and make one gang."" Yeah sure. The question is how convincing he is, and only two themes ring true: the bad ones, revenge and money. His idea of narrative detail is to drop brand names like Bret Easton Ellis; his idea of morality is everybody dies. Ghostface Killah's ""Wildflower"" is far more brutal than the she-cheated-while-I-was-playin ""Undying Love,"" and far less bloody; Biggie's ""Playa Hater"" is far more brutal than the Wu-Puff cameo ""Hate Me Now,"" and far more humorous. Blame his confusion and bad faith on a conscience that's bothered him ever since he bought into the Suge Knight ethos. I've never met a ho in my life. This kind of sellout starts with a ""W.""

It's reassuring to learn there are constants in this changing world. A dozen years ago, Nelson was a better than average fake, and he's still a better-than-average fake.

This is the music ""no one heard"" at the Garden party because Rick ""didn't look the same."" Despite such titles as ""Are You Really Real?"" and ""A Flower Opens Gently By"" he has some reason to pout if music rather than songs is the operative concept--the band is concentrated, jagged. Best music: Chuck Berry's ""I'm Talking About You."" Second-best song: Rick's own ""So Long Mama.""

FALSE,B-,Red Headed Stranger,Willie Nelson,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4171,"
This tale of a murdering preacher wild in his abandonment has inspired much loose talk about violence and Western myth. Ed Ward argues that the Stranger is a fantasy of vengeance rejected on side two, but all I hear is that he's redeemed by another woman there--if she leaves him, he'll kill her too. Some of the individual pieces are quite nice, but the gestalt is the concept album at its most counterproductive--the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts unnecessarily ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context.

""That Lucky Old Sun"" sounds better than ""Amazing Grace""; Steve Fromholz's ""I'd Have to Be Crazy"" sounds better than Willie's ""The Sound in Your Mind.""

Needless to say, he also outsings Kristofferson, and without much extra in the god-given department, though the high note that climaxes ""Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends"" is a doozy.

I enjoy this entry all right, with ""Why Do I Have To Choose,"" a cheating song without a moral, the high point. But two things bother me. First, I prefer the songs I've never heard before to those I'm acquainted with to those I know well. Second, Waylon adds something.

As the duo dueted swingingly through ""I Saw the Light"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel"" on the first of these four sides, I thought Willie had somehow gotten away with yet another triumphant nonalbum, but the slack B-Western self-parody of ""Don't Fence Me In"" and ""Sioux City Sue"" on side two set me straight. And sides three and four, where Leon accompanies Willie through another batch of stardust, are a mistake--even if the music were as good (compare this ""Lucky Old Sun"" to the one on Sound in Your Mind), it's too soon for a reprise. Frank Sinatra he's not.

The Smart Monkee has turned into the Young Herb Alpert, rock's most successful artist-businessman. Pacific Arts, which he owns outright, has purchased his RCA masters for reissue and released albums by such artists as Charles Lloyd. It's also put out Nesmith's ghastly boxed audio-allegory-with-book The Prison, his desultory reputed cult album From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing, his live LP, and now this intelligent, hard-rocking item. What's not clear is whether the records make money--TV commercials are the company's staple. Though Nesmith hasn't sounded this good in years, there's a difference between the pop eccentric he's become and the country-rock eccentric he used to be--he's now a little behind the times instead of ahead of them. Still beats most of what the majors market as power pop. But the only necessity he conveys is a continuing compulsion to make music. And that's not sufficient.

FALSE,B-,Family Groove,The Neville Brothers,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5879,"
On a braver album, ""Fly Like an Eagle"" might be a coup, freedom fighters seizing the '60s-are-over sentimentality of a pop tune about a revolution Steve Miller wasn't so sorry we lost. On this record it's a reproach--the hook no song doctor can sell. Socially conscious, romantically ardent, or trading on their good name, their material just sits there waiting for you to like it. Where on the notorious Uptown they were a confused CHR band who deserved more airplay than they got, here they're a second-rate commercial funk band who get more than they deserve. At least Aaron's Ronstadt outing had the courage of her aesthetic convictions.

FALSE,B-,Looks Like Rain,Mickey Newbury,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7510,"
Sounds like rain, too--also wind, train whistles, ghosts, humming, whistling, electric sitars, and Norman Luboff. If the Mystic Moods Orchestra is Jerry Kennedy's idea of artistic production, he should stick to putting five pieces behind Jerry Lee and Tom T. But my guess is that it's Mickey's. The man is, or can be, a great songwriter, but this lady who left him because she was sad has thrown him into a depression so interesting he wants to savor every drop--almost ruins ""She Even Woke Me Up to say Goodbye"" by taking it too slow. Never trust meteorological symbolism--never.

Although the object of Slade the Leveller's fury isn't hard to figure out--""She'll dance on our graves"" doesn't refer to his mum--the analysis on the three new studio songs is a bit metaphorical for such a populist band. What white coats? What Valley of Death? What Chinese whispers? The live best-of on the B is a live best-of plus half an unannounced sea chantey.

FALSE,B-,Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2,Olivia Newton-John,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5544,"
With a kick in her pert little butt from John Travolta, the Melbourne chameleon has abandoned her conquest of Nashville for a funkier brand of perky, with seven more top-ten singles her reward, and she's sexier than Barbara Mandrell for damn sure. Any heterosexual man who can deny ""Physical,"" with its detonating blonde bombshell switching off from ""physical"" to ""animal"" for the grand finale, needs his monkey-gland shot--to dismiss it as an aerobics song is brunette chauvinism, period. The rest you can pass on to your exercise teacher without permission from the Board of Health.

Although he's a white fella, Nix is something of a fixture on the Memphis blues-soul scene, and the music here is passable in the manner of fixtures on the Memphis blues-soul scene--despite a few bizarre and distracting insertions by septuagenarian bluesman Furry Lewis, which constitute an in-joke characteristic of fixtures etc. Its abiding interest is as an almost unfathomable example of downhome antireligious irony. At least I think it's anti.

FALSE,B-,Neon Golden,The Notwist,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12275,"
Not a fraud. That much I'll grant this evolving German unit's career album. There are tunes, and they're nicely melded to a wide assortment of putatively nonmusical sounds. Not pretentious either, though to say anything kinder about Markus Archer's command of English is to make hope a vice. Also, not cold--lukewarm at least. But then what? Not dynamic? Not exciting? Not much fun? Young people who think Kraftwerk were more important than the Ramones are free to satisfy their craving for the neu with this retreat into simplicity. But even Radiohead and Mouse on Mars contain more chaos. And the chaos is still out there.

First cute, then peculiar, then annoying, their callow act is turning positively perverse as they twinkle-toe past 40. ""Boy's Life"" and ""Immortal for a While"" are only where they state their interest in so many words--everywhere Joey Spampinato's eager eternal-adolescent whine rubs up against Terry Adams's sly grownup changes. They may be smart enough to consider this a creative tension, but it isn't. It's an evasion--a fib as opposed to a lie, kiddies--and it isn't funny anymore.

FALSE,B-,Gonna Take a Miracle,Laura Nyro,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7539,"
In which the Bronx tearjerker reveals the source of her gloppy sensibility--good old girl-group rock and roll. Which is fine, except that glop tastes best prepared according to the traditional recipes, rather than disguised as untrammeled lyricism the way it is here. Might be different if Nyro were Aretha Franklin, as is painfully obvious every time she shows off the high part of her famous range. Still, backup singers Labelle don't screech once, Gamble &amp; Huff control the rhythm section if not the artiste, and two of the ten remakes are ear-openers: ""I Met Him on a Sunday,"" which begins acappella, and ""Monkey Time/Dancing in the Street,"" which rocks.

The momentum of the Moments' ""Sexy Mama"" does her nicely through ""Children of the Junks,"" in which r&amp;b goes to Hong Kong, and ""Money,"" the second straight track to use the word ""tax-free,"" although it ends ominously, with instructions to ""make your vibe go round."" And sure enough, this gasps on from there like a novice practicing circular breathing. I'd say that after four years she's out of training, but she's never been in training.

FALSE,B-,Season of Lights: Laura Nyro in Concert,Laura Nyro,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7541,"
Most rock and rollers are too loose on live albums, but Nyro gets so carried away in the studio that the unerasable living band insures relatively straightforward remakes. My favorite moment, though, is when she introduces the musicians in a speaking voice nasal enough to make Dion sound Delta born-and-raised--finally I understand why Bronxites love her. I await explanations from Queens.

FALSE,B-,Beatitude,Ric Ocasek,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5564,"
They say Ocasek forces it with the Cars, but Shake It Up sounded too relaxed, while this solo effort is tense throughout. And if instrumentally the effect is bracing, vocally it's constipated: only on the avuncular ""Jimmy Jimmy"" do his affections (not to mention his pretensions) have any roughage to them.

FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits,Phil Ochs,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7542,"
Sporting his gold lame suit and boasting that ""50 Phil Ochs fans can't be wrong!,"" the Singing Yippie bids for pop power once again on this prematurely entitled work of art. Van Dyke Parks's classy, countrified production suits Phil's strange lyricism a lot better than the baroque excesses of Pleasures of the Harbor, but in the end Ochs's compulsive sweetness does him in anyway. It's always been one of the prime paradoxes of folkiedom that our most astringent protester should come on like Richard Dyer-Bennett gone Nashville, and the sad truth is that the lone protest number is the weakest cut on the disappointing second side. But even the first side, as strong as any pop Ochs has written to date, works in spite of his voice. Fond as I am of ""James Dean of Indiana,"" I think it would be even more haunting done deadpan, by Arlo Guthrie or Tom T. Hall.

FALSE,B-,Universal Mother,Sinï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5911,"
I confess this has grown on me. The quiet, stunning ""All Apologies"" is only the latest proof of the vocal gift--part physical (clarity, texture, amplitude), part spiritual (openness, commitment)--that can make her a great cover artist. Her lullaby is a stroke, and her signoff love song arrives at a nicely unreadable tone. But from Germaine Greer's great mother of a prologue (performancewise, Farrakhan's got the sister beat) to the weeper that could tempt Bruno Bettelheim to tell moron jokes (just precisely who does ""scorn"" the little retard, anyway?) to the instructional rap that'll catch your ear so fast you'll waste scarcely a second pushing the next-track button (no famine OK, ""post traumatic stress disorder"" blarney), the framing could be a parody conceived by son of Eire P.J. O'Rourke, and it renders the album essentially inaccessible. This isn't risking foolishness--it's flaunting it.

FALSE,B-,Odyssey,Odyssey,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7543,"
Native New Yorkers who just can't wait anymore for the next Dr. Buzzard have turned to this, in which the Dr.'s producer once again weaves meaningful lyrics into a texture discrete enough not to digest its own strands. But the sad truth is that words and music here are much less dry, audacious, and, well, hip. For me, they evoke the Anglophile West Indies rather than the barrio.

""Contradiction"" and ""Far East Mississippi"" are in such a no-bullshit mode that they can get away with change-of-pace woo-pitchers, although they've done better than these. But, like Gerald Ford, they can't get away with ""Bi-Centennial.""

FALSE,B-,Message in the Music,The O'Jays,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7556,"
The message in the message is inoffensive enough to let the message in the music come through; my favorite lines (not that I don't have unfavorites): ""Heaven is just a condition/Hell is a condition too."" But the music never peaks; the songs are too medium, if you know what I mean, their pleasures bound up in performance subtleties that ought to be hooked, at least once, onto something obvious.

FALSE,B-,Danny O'Keefe,Danny O'Keefe,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7559,"
Though he thinks too much about smog and winos, O'Keefe sings the blues like a good old boy and takes his ""mama"" with him when he leaves town--in short, handles standard new-troubadourisms with some originality. And every once in a while he writes a potential standard like ""Sweet Rollin'"" (femme fatale) or ""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues"" (a rounder's tragedy). But producer Ahmet Ertegun stifles ""Saturday Morning"" in Shoals soul, arranges ""Steel Guitar"" sans steel guitar, and indulges all of his boy's most misguided pretensions.
"
FALSE,B-,Black Foliage: Animation Music,The Olivia Tremor Control,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3742,"
This division of the Elephant 6 consortium loves tunes, and its soundscaping has few equals in indiedom. When it mixes the two, the result is often kinda beautiful even though the lyrics are avowedly ""not going to shed any new light on humanity,"" and even though the sonics tend toward the perverse-disembodied outtake snippets, mechanical malfunctions, and tape fuckups that their hip-hop counterparts would bury in beats or declare inimical to organic life. But as the album goes on (and on), the strategy becomes not noize-toon synthesis, but weird song as reward for unpleasant sound. At its most generous, this may be the music of the young Brian Wilson's dysfunctional dreams. But at its most pretentious it's his bad trip. And bad trips weren't the main reason the psychedelic worldview fell into disrepute. The main reason was that it was full of shit.

FALSE,B-,It's Alright,Yoko Ono,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5576,"
Supposedly a big shrewdie, Yoko is transcendently simplistic at the core, which in many ways worked better when she was an avant-gardist than it does in her belated pop phase. This somewhat presumptuous message of hope to the world is cunningly devised around the edges--she exploits the studio with fifty years' and countless dollars' worth of childlike delight. but back at the core, the singing and the songs are more one-dimensional than good pop ever is.
"
FALSE,B-,Starpeace,Yoko Ono,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5577,"
Bill Laswell looked like the perfect choice to assist Yoko's rebound from It's Alright, especially given his commitment to non-Western music and his penchant for avant-gardists, mostly jazzmen but a few of Yoko's ilk. But despite unfailingly humorless lyrics and the skillful input of Laswell regulars from Aiyb Dieng to Anton Fier, the result is insistently, self-consciously, and rather clumsily light in the head. Often it tries to be cute, which is difficult for anyone and utterly impossibly for Laswell, who isn't exactly a froth specialist. Sure he helps with the hooks and beats, that's his job, but the overall effect is as joyless as the kind of record Toto might cut for a girlfriend of their manager's--the soulless studio-rock anti-intellectuals have always accused him of making. Great exception: ""You and I,"" a silly love song for Sean.

Not bad for a reunion LP--a lot more authentic sounding than the Byrds'. But then, the Animals weren't as good as the Byrds. And the only time Eric Burdon really recaptures that old white magic is on ""Many Rivers to Cross,"" such a cliche by now that only a singer as crude as Eric, with his desperate key changes and random enthusiasm, can bring it to life. Me, I'll take ""Sky Pilot.""

A couple of years ago these guys released two mysterious singles with almost nothing on them but bass, buzz, beats, and offhand joshing. One of those singles is lost among the protests, admonitions, sexism, camaraderie, laugh lines, true stories, and samples of this professional rap album. It's the old rock and roll story--a lot of knowledge can also be a dangerous thing.

FALSE,B-,Woyaya,Osibisa,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7568,"
I don't want to say they're hokey, but this is their second consecutive album to begin with jungle sounds, and I think we get the point. Actually, the problem is that they're not hokey enough, or not in the right way--plenty of quasi-virtuoso jams and brother-brother-brother, but nothing tricky enough to echo in your head once the drums have faded away.

When it comes to lists of cities visited on tour, I'll take James Brown--he's got a better beat, maybe even a more African one. But if you happen to be in one of those cities on the appointed night, you should probably try to hear them--their records have never come up to their live notices.

FALSE,B-,"""Addictions"" Volume 1",Robert Palmer,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5588,"
Is this fraud really the Dorian Gray wannabee of jacket photos? I don't know, and unless the women he beds are a lot more interesting than the models who populate his videos, I don't even want you to tell me. Rather than a tax-exiled roue, I prefer to imagine him as a secret straight who takes the fast train to his modest Surrey estate after a hard day's posing in London, arriving in time for a civilized dinner with wife and children before plopping in front of the VCR with a bottle of cognac. Honesty compels me to acknowledge, however, that my wife doesn't think he's a fraud--once spied him buying groceries just around the corner, and liked what she saw. In a world where male rock critics get Sheena Easton and Kim Gordon--who owns Palmer's only great song, ""Addicted to Love,"" the way Junior Tucker owns ""Some Guys Get All the Luck""--she's got a right. But I still give the grades around here.

If you think it's a little early for a concert album by Parker, who's not exactly Peter Frampton on the rackjobber circuit, you're right, but only if you view this--three live sides plus one 33-rpm single (the fourth version of ""Don't Ask Me Questions"" Parker has put on disc)--as music, or product. Regard it instead as a gambit designed to terminate his contract with Mercury. The music that fleshes out the gambit has a nice intensity that gets left out of those nasty rumors. But none of the songs are new and none of the remakes revelatory.

""I'm not exactly into humor,"" he observes in ""Canned Laughter,"" and truer words were never spoken--unless you count ""Mercury Poisoning,"" I don't think he's cracked a joke in ten years. So maybe he should give it a try. I know sensitivity didn't work. But squeezing out one more round of angry hooks doesn't work either.

FALSE,B-,Chartbusters,Ray Parker Jr.,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5786,"
Greatest Hits is definitive, ""Ghostbusters"" a contemporary classic available in seven- and twelve-inch formats, and this a redundancy from an artist whose contract is coming up.

Maybe Ray is getting jaded--pussy comes so easy now that he no longer bothers to hone his come-on. Whether he's scoring on sensitivity (oh really, ""Men Have Feelings Too""?) or studsmanship (though I do enjoy the bone and puddy-tat lines in ""I'm a Dog""), he's putting out just enough to get her into the car. The sole exception is ""I'm in Love,"" in which a workaholic falls for ""an interesting girl"" who doesn't have a job. Workaholic--now that sounds like the real Ray to me.

FALSE,B-,Trombipulation,Parliament,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5791,"
Reports of George Clinton's demise are premature, but there's reason to worry about his body tone. Although the transcendent silliness of ""Agony of Defeet"" recalls past glories, the quotes from Bach, Brylcreem, and Mother Goose are dim echoes of the sharp confidence games of yore, and on occasion this sounds kind of like Fuzzy Haskins &amp; Co. Hmm.

""Jolene"" proves that sometimes she's a great singer-songwriter. ""I Will Always Love You"" proves that sometimes she's a good one. Porter Wagoner's ""Lonely Comin' Down"" proves that sometimes she should just sing. Her own ""Highlight of My Life"" proves that sometimes she should just shut up. And the rest proves nothing.

Aficionados complain that her sellout has become audible, but while I admit that the cute squeals on ""Applejack"" are pure merchandising, she's always been willing to sell what she couldn't give away. I think Dolly has made the pop move a lot more naturally than, say, Tanya Tucker. The problem here afflicts every genre: material.

If Willie and Merle, her equals as country artists, can turn into premier pop singers, why can't Dolly? Maybe because she's justifiably smitten with her physical gifts. Just as she can't resist pushup bras, she can't resist oversinging, showing off every curve of a gorgeous voice that's still developing new ones. On the other hand, maybe it has to do with why she wears wigs, which if I'm not mistaken is because she doesn't really like her hair.

FALSE,B-,360 Degrees of Billy Paul,Billy Paul,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5630,"
At his worst, Paul is black naturalness at its most mannered--florid, hyped up, homiletic, sort of a Les McCann of small-time jazz singers. But Gamble and Huff have been making great music out of middlebrow jazz for years, and when they give Paul a good song--several of the black-consciousness riffs, which G&amp;H seem to turn out as if they were so many follow-ups to ""Tighten Up,"" are better than ""Me and Mrs. Jones""--his overstatement is no more offensive than Ray Charles's. On stupid, unrealistic songs (e.g., ""I'm Just a Prisoner"") he sounds stupid and unrealistic, which figures.

FALSE,B-,Take This Job and Shove It,Johnny Paycheck,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11367,"
If this is proof that country is the real working-class music, then the only oppressor the working man knows is the woman whose pedestal he supports and the only right he demands is the right to cry in his beer. There's enough anomie, male bonding, and random violence on this record to inspire one cover story on whither outlaw and another on whither punk, and although it offers numerous insights, I wish I believed just a few of them were as intentional as the catchiness of the tunes.

FALSE,B-,The Teaches of Peaches,Peaches,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10061,"
Not cock-rock, bukkake-rock. And though you may be lucky enough not to know what that means, Peaches had better. Doesn't matter whether she's a performance artist, a concept rocker, a bored schoolteacher, or an expat with a gimmick. ""Come on, hot rod/Give me your wad"" etc. is prosex postfeminism for the age of Internet porn, in which thousands of women a day prove how cool they are by smiling through their semen facials. It's wish fulfillment for boys who make passes at girls who wear glasses. And given a beat by Chilly Gonzales's low-techno bump and grind, it's perfect for a fashion industry finally past the embarrassment of junkie chic.

FALSE,B-,Tellin' It,Ann Peebles,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5638,"
Peebles's small, rough-cut ruby of a voice can't buy her Aretha's kind of time, her hesitant pursuit of a dramatic frame, an artistic self, will never do the duty of a real persona. Which may mean that Willie Mitchell is wrong for her. Not only does this seamless funk deprive her of the sharply accentuated settings her instrument was created for, but his concentration on music to the exclusion of image leaves her singing warmed-over Millie Jackson wife-and-other-woman lyrics with the wan confusion they deserve.

FALSE,B-,Southern Accents,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5611,"
Petty's problem isn't that he's dumb, or even that people think he's dumb, although they have reason to. It's that he feels so sorry for himself he can't think straight. Defending the South made sense back when Ronnie Van Zant was writing ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" but in the Sun Belt era it's just pique. The modernizations of sometime coproducer Dave Stewart mitigate the neoconservative aura somewhat, but unmitigating it right back is Petty's singing, its descent from stylization into affectation most painful on side one's concept songs. Side two is less consequential, and better. Note, however, that its show-stopper is ""Spike,"" in which a bunch of rednecks, I mean good old boys, prepare to whup a punk. It's satire. Yeah sure.

FALSE,B-,After Words,Bob Pfeifer,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=396,"
When half of the greatest couple band this side of X makes a solo album that broods obsessively about a broken relationship, we're entitled to our biographical assumptions. Damn right it's more fun to fuss and fight than to sit home feeling sorry for yourself, but the idea is to illuminate this truth, not prove it.

FALSE,B-,The Best of PG&E,PG&E,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5658,"
You have to sympathize with a band whose tragic history includes the theft of their name--a name greater than Tongue &amp; Groove or Nova Local--by a power monopoly. But this boasts as many moments as they deserve. Charlie Allen synthesizes Taj Mahal and Otis Redding (more Arthur Conley, actually) over a blues-soul ensemble without the chops or drive of the similar bands led by Delaney Bramlett, one of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's producers. The highlight is their only hit, the rousing ""Are You Ready?"" Added attractions include ""Rock and Roller's Lament,"" which is autobiographical, and ""Staggolee,"" which isn't.

FALSE,B-,Farmhouse,Phish,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5321,"
Tuneful, sturdy, unfaltering, bland, it's the pioneering jam band's bid for the market share located some years ago by Dave Matthews. Enthusiasts may even claim it proves they're better than Dave Matthews, as indeed it does, though why that needed proving I couldn't tell you. Inspirational Verse: ""Each betrayal begins with trust/Every man returns to dust."" ""One man gathers what another man spills"" was taken.

Phoenix knocked me out on sheer pizazz fronting a raw, Beatley band called Romantic Noise at Max's three or four years ago; here he surfaces as a Springsteen convert and almost does it again, although after a dozen plays I wonder whether Romantic Noise's songs matched its pizazz. God knows Phoenix doesn't go for ersatz John Cougar epics--his tribute is all musical style, which since his voice outrings Springsteen's can be pretty impressive until the drama calls your attention to the words.

I'd like him back too, but wishing won't make it so. Half straight disco, half soft--for Pickett--soul, this is a mildly enjoyable album that hasn't broken pop or disco or added a ""Lay Me Like You Hate Me"" to his legend. N.b.: the four (out of seven) best songs are the ones he helped write. Also n.b.: the best of them all is on the disco side.

FALSE,B-,Meddle,Pink Floyd,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5683,"
Not bad. ""Echoes"" moves through 23:21 of ""Across the Universe"" cop with the timeless calm of interstellar overdrive, and the acoustic-type folk songs boast their very own melodies (as well as a real dog, rather than electronic seagulls, for sound effect). The word ""behold"" should never cross their filters again, but this is definitely an improvement: one eensy-weensy step for humanity, one giant step for Pink Floyd.
"
FALSE,B-,The Wall,Pink Floyd,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2777,"
For a dumb tribulations-of-a-rock-star epic, this isn't bad--unlikely to arouse much pity or envy, anyway. The music is all right, too--kitschy minimal maximalism with sound effects and speech fragments. But the story is confused, ""mother"" and ""modern life"" make unconvincing villains, and if the recontextualization of ""up against the wall"" is intended ironically, I don't get it.

FALSE,B-,Artifakts (BC),Plastikman,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5325,"
One needn't feel deep sympathy for the minimalist project to find use and pleasure in the right Brian Eno or David Behrman, or to conclude that, all subjective affinities aside, Tangerine Dream were full of it. Richie Hawtin is at once sparer and beatier, but not by much, and anyone who would sit there for an hour finding out where he's going has too much time to kill. The belated third volume of a trilogy whose earlier installments I dutifully checked out and guiltlessly discarded, this climaxes midway through with an uncanny evocation of static going down the drain before breaking into a cute little piece of electrofunk that might be sampled by someone with more to say. Then it moves on to Tangerine Dream.

FALSE,B-,Everywhere at Once,The Plimsouls,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5703,"
I explain the ""underground"" rep of these L.A. power-poppers by asking myself whether I wouldn't be mystified by the Fleshtones if I lived in L.A. As befits an L.A. band, they make more of a show of hitcraft, martialing coherent lyrics to actual emotional effect on a couple of slower ones, and less of a show of partymania. And I don't like the Fleshtones' records a whole lot either.

Be kind and call it Bette Midler's Disease. Or remember what they used to say (stupidly, but why quibble) about the Dolls: you had to be there. Even then the flat-on-its-face overstatement of recorded Buster is pretty appalling. Intimations of minstrelsy he's always subsumed live become all too Negroid with the melon-chomping bass man of ""Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well?,"" even the Sarafina-backed ""All Night Party."" And Buster's no better at bigtime schmaltz than David was. I begrudge him nothing. But I don't want to say thanks for the memories yet.

FALSE,B-,Energy,The Pointer Sisters,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5700,"
With Richard Perry at the helm and the hyperactivity of sister Bonnie channeled into a socially useful project, they reappear here as Linda Ronstadt, in triplicate and with a beat. In other words, these are excellent songs rockingly performed. But there's something overly temperate about the music, and most of the songs have been interpreted more smartly by artists who care as much about words as they do about notes.

FALSE,B-,Pointer Sisters' Greatest Hits,The Pointer Sisters,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5701,"
In the four years since Richard Perry aimed these former eccentrics (see MCA's reretro Retrospect, 1981) at the middle of the radio, they've had three top-ten hits, three top-five hits, three you remember: ""Fire,"" ""Slow Hand,"" ""He's So Shy."" With a couple of minor exceptions, which are also the two remaining top-thirty entries (would markets were always so efficient), everything else has been El Lay assembly-line crapola. Everything Perry included on this kiss-off to Elektra distribution, anyway.

The idea is to fuse Sting's ringing rock voice and the trio's aggressive, hard-edged rock attack with a less eccentric version of reggae's groove and a saner version of reggae's mix. To me the result sounds half-assed. And though I suppose I might find the ""synthesis"" innovative if I heard as much reggae as they do in England, it's more likely I'd find it infuriating.

Granted his major-label production budget in the sky, Tim DeLaughter hones his tunes and dispels woozy comparisons to the Flaming Lips. He's on record as wondering why his collective can't have hits like the Association and the 5th Dimension. And when history batters those dreams as it will so many, he'll still have the herewithal to mount a long-running local production of Hair. Even in Dallas, America always makes room for the culture of dissent.

Granted artistic freedom by idealist entrepreneur Chris Stein after three albums of hard-rock self-formulization for bad old Clive Davis, the Ig comes up with the most experimental record of his career. Which sucks. Don't blame music-meister Rob duPrey, whose settings maintain stylistic continuity yet generate a certain theoretical interest of their own. Blame the slogans, social theory, in-jokes, bad poetry, and vocal dramaturgy he had to work with.

When you're this subtle, marginal differentiation is everything. Louder tracks, sparser samples, less insinuating tunes--all these changes are slight, but they impel antistar-to-die-for Beth Gibbons six inches toward stridency, and she's hard enough to take seriously when she's toning it down. The real and theoretical depressives who adore them will experience this as growth. Workaday music lovers will glance off Gibbons's shows of misery and never figure out why.

FALSE,B-,"Elvis Country (I'm 10,000 Years Old)",Elvis Presley,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1164,"
A disastrous conceit, in which snippets of a ""theme"" song segue between tracks, makes it very hard to tell what happens to the Big Concept--Elvis Sings Ernest Tubb, Bill Monroe, Bob Wills, Anne Murray, etc. Most of his recordings sound suspiciously casual anyway, like preconcert runthroughs, and these segues add a rushed medley feel. ""The Fool"" and ""It's Your Baby, You Rock It"" work, and ""Whole Lot-ta Shakin'"" works out. But Tubb's ""Tomorrow Never Comes"" is a horn-fed monstrosity. And somehow I don't think Elvis had his heart in ""Snowbird.""

Just in case you were starting to think there's no such thing as eternal life, I decided to acknowledge this, one of the King's thrice-yearly mixes of three (almost classic) killers and seven (not bad) fillers. As sloppy as ever, of course--you want he should be neat?
"
FALSE,B-,Moody Blue,Elvis Presley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5741,"
Despite his capacity for undifferentiated emotion and his utter confidence with almost every kind of American music, Presley didn't automatically impart dignity to anything he laid his voice on the way such natural singers as George Jones and Al Green and Dolly Parton do. Originally a spoiled tough of omnipresent sexual magnetism, he deteriorated into a spoiled stud past his prime, so that while he was always sexy he wasn't always seductive. Whether he's turning it on (""Unchained Melody"") or playing it cool (""Little Darling""), his miscalculations can be embarrassing. But he retains so much presence that he can make two Olivia Newton-John songs sound like country classics indifferently remembered. And when he hits it right, as on the first three tracks of side two, his sincerity, vulnerability, and self-possession are as potent as ever. It seems perfectly suitable that this shoddily conceived LP, pressed on blue plastic for gimmick appeal, should turn into his biggest of the decade on the strength of the ultimate gimmick.
"
FALSE,B-,The Kids and Me,Billy Preston,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5747,"
True enough, his songs have become less offensive, but his instrumentals remain in the novelty phase and he still sings like Soul Synth No. 1. Take ""Nothing From Nothing"" as this year's ""You're So Vain""--proof that a great single can come from any fool. But don't be quite so positive he won't make an album you want to hear some day.

FALSE,B-,O Lucky Man!,Alan Price,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5751,"
How does an acerbic, good-humored music journeyman like Price (find This Price Is Right, on Parrot) fall in with a pompous, overfed con artist like Lindsay Anderson? By playing the Acerbic, Good-Humoured Music Journeyman Symbol in a pompous, overfed movie. Two or three deft political songs do not redeem an LP that runs 24:43 despite filler. It figures--the movie is an hour (or three hours) too long.

FALSE,B-,The Best of Charley Pride Vol. III,Charley Pride,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5754,"
It's no longer so easy to hit consistently in Nashville with such MOR (MOR country, I mean) material, but Pride does it, specializing in happy-marriage songs (which I often find likable) and touching such themes as Jesus, elusive dreams, childhood home, and country-singer-on-the-road (with sex). An achievement, even though he's got a gimmick as well as a voice--which seems to be softening slightly, losing its resonant edge. But especially given how middling his MOR often is, I wish he wanted to do--or is it could do?--more.
"
FALSE,B-,For You,Prince,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5755,"
Like most in-studio one-man bands, the nineteen-year-old kid who pieced this disco-rock-pop-funk concoction together has a weakness for the programmatic--lots of chops, not much challenge. But I like ""Baby,"" about making one, and ""Soft and Wet,"" ditto only he doesn't know it yet. And his falsetto beats Stevie Wonder's, not to mention Emitt Rhodes's.

FALSE,B-,Around the World in a Day,Prince and the Revolution,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2804,"
It's pretty strange, given that he looked like a visionary not long ago. But this arrested adolescent obviously don't know nuthin about nuthin--except maybe his own life, which for all practical purposes ended in his adolescence, since even for a pop star he does his damnedest to keep the world out. So while his sexual fantasies are outrageous only in their callous predictability and his ballads compelling only as shows of technique, they sure beat his reflexive antinomianism and dim politics. Which suggests  why the solid if decidedly unpsychedelic musical pleasures our young craftsman makes available here don't wash. Only the crass ""Raspberry Beret"" and maybe the crooning ""Condition of the Heart"" are worth your time.

Weird. With production by Knox and Jerry (Sons of Sam) Phillips, Prine has never rocked harder. But he's slurring his vocals like some toothless cartoon bluesman emulating an Elvis throwaway--related to the Sun sound, I guess, but perversely. Are the new songs any good? Hard to tell.

Gigging with a local band this way would be a terrible idea for more accomplished rock and rollers, but as it is, the enthusiastic provincials kick Procol's ass on ""Conquistador,"" great meaningless fun in the tradition of ""Quick Joey Small."" And you have to admit that the string and horn arrangements are different.

FALSE,B-,Kamaal the Abstract,Q-Tip,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14871,"
Arista didn't pull this jazzmatazz off its 2002 release schedule because major labels are evil. Arista pulled it because it stunk. Buried at Track 7, the developed rhyme, unkiltered time, unsettling keyboards, and Kenny Garrett sax coda of ""Abstractionisms"" deliver what the flowery ""Caring"" and the endless ""Do You Dig U?"" emphatically do not: the ""brand new sound"" the finale only brags about. In the narrow sense of rhythm tracks, the beats have some ass to them, but as music they revert to fusion kitsch whenever the artiste sees an opening: swamping the bridge of the trifling ""Heels,"" hogging the back end of the working-girl praise song ""Even If It Is So."" Fact is, without his group this major rapper has been lost musically since 1999. In 2008, he denoodled some on ""The Renaissance and the Abstract Innovations"" mixtape. But though I'm sure there are other cameos I've forgotten or missed, for me his best work of the decade came fronting the Chemical Brothers and freestyling on Kanye West's ""Touch the Sky,"" first immersed in an alien music, then relying on his naked voice.

FALSE,B-,Quatro,Suzi Quatro,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7576,"
Dumb, yes. Samey, still. Leiber-Stoller's ""Trouble"" sounds silly--even in that chrome sweat suit, Suzi can't convince me she's evil. And I wish her physical equipment--her medium-sized voice, her static bass playing, and her workmanlike band--were up to her concept and the likable, mostly Chapmann-Chinn material. But I do believe she's tough and independent, and I'd rather hear Quatro shouting out ""Keep a Knockin'"" than a whole album of Maria Muldaur stylizations.
"
FALSE,B-,Your Mama Won't Like Me,Suzi Quatro,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7577,"
The songs are a shade weaker, but the real problem--and I'm sure Clive Davis had nothing to do with it--is classier arrangements that give her more room to sing. Suzi just doesn't have the stuff to make like an interpreter, whether torching up ""Fever"" or doing a Janis on ""Strip Me."" She lives and dies as a straight-ahead rocker.

This is near enough to the reported mishmash to make me doubt that it sells for what's good about it. Which is that it doesn't actually botch any of a half-dozen arty-to-heavy ""eclectic"" modes--even something called ""Prophet's Song"" sounds OK--and achieves a parodic tone often enough to suggest more than meets the ear. Maybe if they come up with a coherent masterwork I'll figure out what that more is. Maybe if they come up with a coherent masterwork they'll figure out what that more is.

Whether Happy Trails is one of the great live albums or (my theory) one of the greatly overrated ones, Quicksilver needn't have bothered--their studio LPs capture that ballroom ambience right down to the echoed vocals and the imprecise impressionistic accompaniment. And though the debut is more listenable, this beats it for sheer documentary charm. Complete with twin guitars and a ""Ladies Section"" on the jacket comprising twenty-six first names, here is the quintessential Frisco band--its writing folky without the roots, its playing jazzy without the chops, its concepts unencumbered by any sense of form. The big news is the return of Dino Valenti, but the big attraction is the quintessential Quicksilver anthem, ""Fresh Air,"" as in ""Have another hit."" Plus those twin guitars--John Cipollina and Gary Duncan, we salute you.

FALSE,B-,OK Computer,Radiohead,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2857,"
My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been Wish You Were Here, and you know why? It has soul, that's why--it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero but as long as he's Roger's that doesn't matter. Radiohead wouldn't know a tragic hero if they were cramming for their A levels, and their idea of soul is Bono, who they imitate further at the risk of looking even more ridiculous than they already do. So instead they pickle Thom Yorke's vocals in enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month. Their art-rock has much better sound effects than the Floyd snoozefest Dark Side of the Moon. But it's less sweeping and just as arid.

A miraculously homogeneous album--except for the breakthrough sax refrain on ""Baker Street,"" neither voice nor instrument ruffles the flow of hard-won axioms and sensible hooks. Very nice, I mean it--if yin and yang is your meat, this beats Percy Faith by a mile. But Fleetwood Mac it ain't.

If on 1986's Nine Lives, the first bummer of a three-decade career divided by a cleaning-up period, she was a cynic at the end of her rope, on the second she's a self-remade woman calling the shots. As usual, the few songs she wrote herself outstrip the others. But even those are for roots-rock matures who share her worldview so narrowly that not a note or emotion takes her anywhere she doesn't know like her own night table. The exceptions are a single helping of Malian guitar from Habib Koite and, to an extent, a gospel rouser by Zimbabwean crossover darling Oliver Mtukudzi. More such tracks might have forced a stretch. Instead she starts off by warning the young against ""dealing on the street."" Somehow I don't think this is gonna win any war on drugs--or get her on TRL.

You can hear Felix trying to get back as side one begins--he sings ""Feel good to be alive"" as if the phrase had just occurred to him. On ""Saga of New York"" he goes into high gear--catchy, funny, sexy, simple-minded--and he holds his own against ""Be on the Real Side."" But as Buzzy Feiten starts tricking up his own ""Jungle Walk,"" you wonder whether jungles are coy. And then you realize that there's a pink horse on the cover for a reason.

The Nostalgia Squad loves these guys--supposedly, they reincarnate the halcyon days of the pre-psychedelic mid-'60s, when rock was simple, happy music sung by harmonizing foursomes in mod clothes. Only thing is, that music used to keep us humming all day, and after listening to this for a month all I remember is three songs: ""Let's Pretend,"" ""I Wanna Be With You,"" and a remarkable Beach Boys takeoff that has tape decks in it.

""Starry Eyes"" is a great single, but it's all hook, and hooks like that don't grow on albums. Which is why only two of the songs that fill in the blanks, ""Teenarama"" and ""Insomnia,"" transcend pop professionalism.

Like so many unpretentious and unheard-of string/bluegrass/jug amalgams, this one offers a pleasant but rather slight variation on a familiar musical question, to wit: ""Do I really want to hear another version of `Golden Vanity' just because this time the mate is a she?"" They also do Bessie Smith, which is a mistake, and a shape-note hymn, which isn't. Noteworthy for uncovering an antifeminist mountain song from the '20s and for reviving the joyful, rather zany emancipation celebration, ""Kingdom Coming,"" which Peter Stampfel singles out as the first truly American melody.

Eight cuts from the engagement that produced In Person at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go, recorded in April 1966, twenty months before he died, and unreleased until late 1978. Only two of three new titles are attached to new songs, including an ""A Hard Day's Night"" that's apparently a warm-up for the ""Day Tripper"" on Live in Europe.

Convinced that a life is a wonderful thing to waste, the McDonald brothers devote theirs to writing better songs than Blue Cheer and the Barbarians--and rocking out harder, too! References to Gandhi, George Harrison, and Buffy Sainte-Marie establish their historical breadth, insults to their girlfriends their punk roots.

Side two is a partial recoup--however uncool devoting songs to loved ones may appear to the Autonomous Assholes of America, it makes sense when in fact your family (mother, father, namesake aunt) is dying all around you, and what's more it sounds like it makes sense.

I've pretty much given up on Reddy. Never again will she risk arrangements that accentuate what's most idiosyncratic about her voice, probably because the pop audience would be even more threatened by such a sharp instrument (and the sharp mind that goes with it) than the rock audience. Nevertheless, hearing all her pop favorites in one place isn't as dispiriting as I'd feared. Didn't realize she'd had three hits about women who'd probably be diagnosed as clinically insane, and am pleased to report that the intro featuring Reddy's daughter has been restored to ""You and Me Against the World""--we're more in need of songs about single parents than of songs about nuclear couples.

As minstrelsy goes, this is good-hearted stuff (and as minstrelsy, it had better be). The reason it doesn't quite come off isn't that it's good-hearted, either: the band is outrageous enough, though probably not the way it thinks it is. Perhaps there's a clue in this mysterious observation from spokesperson Flea: ""Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow have great raps, but not that great music with it.""

How desperate rock scribes are for shows of quality by bands of any remaining commercial clout. This piece of let's-slow-it-down-a-little isn't terrible unless you're expecting thee funk, but though it was greeted with hosannas in a slow news month, it's certainly a turn or two slacker than Californication. When you're an energy band, wisdom don't make much nevermind. But melodies, harmonies, and so forth are supposed to drag some spiritual stuff along with them. It's not enough for Anthony Keidis to get all mature--he's supposed to say something interesting about maturity. And he's never had thing one to say about anything else.

Only the familiar tale of their Grammy validation renders the familiar tale of their double album that shoulda been a single mildly interesting. Once a bassist's band, now a guitarist's band, they're most of all an '80s band, their spiritual core, such as it is, is rooted in the agony and ecstasy of heroin and cocaine. At least when the bassist ruled they livened up this overworked dynamic with beats. Now they tax it with tunes, at least when they're on their game--as in the dead-end relationship song ""Desecration Smile"" and the marriage proposal ""Hard to Concentrate.""

FALSE,B-,Redwing,Redwing,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7617,"
Much return-of-good-old hoopla coming our way on this Sacramento quartet, and you can hear why--they're concise and quirkily intense in a laidback time (and place). But finally they don't do much more for Sacramento than, say, Randy Burns does for New Haven--even if they do take after the Band, to whom Ralph J. rather presumptuously compares them on the back cover, and Moby Grape. Difference is songs (and singing) that evince care and craft but no special inspiration. Isn't it always?
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Jerry Reed,Jerry Reed,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7618,"
Reed sustains three identities: redneck crazy, fancy picker, and soap idol. He's a great crazy, greater even on ""Amos Moses"" and ""Tupelo Mississippi Flash"" than on ""When You're Hot, You're Hot."" And he's an all right picker, if you like pickers. But he couldn't sell soap to a hippie's mother. If RCA can't put together a whole album called The Crazy Jerry Reed, at least they could program one side that way.
"
FALSE,B-,Transformer,Lou Reed,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7620,"
All that's left of this great singer and songwriter is his sly intelligence, and sometimes I'm not so sure about that. Whether this is scenemaking music or anti-scenemaking music doesn't matter--it's effete, ingrown, stripped to inessentials. First line of strongest song: ""Vicious, you hit me with a flower.""
"
FALSE,B-,Lou Reed Live,Lou Reed,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2143,"
This rocks almost as good as Rock n Roll Animal. But where that record reanimated the Velvets, the reworked solo stuff here is invested with the kind of contempt that Lou seems to think goes naturally with having a real audience. And I could do without the drumboasts on ""Waiting for My Man.""
"
FALSE,B-,Rock and Roll Heart,Lou Reed,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2146,"
""I Believe in Love"" is a fairly hilarious send-up of the let's-get-down game Lou is playing right now. I mean, could Mitch Ryder or Ian Hunter ""believe in the Iron Cross"" one line and ""good-time music"" a couple later? (Christ, I hope they don't take this as a challenge.) But the joke doesn't quite hold up, and sometimes it gets lost altogether, at which point Reed sounds like he's imitating his worst enemy, himself. Not the disgrace his followers believe, but not the bad-time music he's capable of.
"
FALSE,B-,Reveal,R.E.M.,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6182,"
Not as bad as it first sounds, but also not as good as they thought when they released it, or they wouldn't have, I hope. Suffused with somnolent tempos and pensive arrangements, the romantic trials and spiritual quests of struggling rock and rollers can be pretty hard to take, so why should we care about the ditto of wealthy movie producers with a record contract to fulfill and 21 individually acknowledged string players on call? Even a movie producer who knows the names of Japanese carp and French emotions that he'll happily print out in the booklet now that he's e-nun-ci-a-ting ev-ry sing-gle word?

FALSE,B-,Hi Infidelity,REO Speedwagon,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8278,"
I'm not saying they deserve the biggest seller of their crummy era. But however meaningless the results, they do know something about the hook and the readymade. My favorite is ""Tough Guys,"" which will never go top forty because it features this Inspirational Verse: ""They think they're full of fire/She thinks they're full of shit.""
"
FALSE,B-,Emitt Rhodes,Emitt Rhodes,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7631,"
A formalist in an age of license, Rhodes writes very tuneful rock and roll songs and overdubs all the voices and instruments in the studio, distinguishable from Paul McCartney mostly by his compulsive precision. As a believer in pop structures I approve, but as a lover of rock and roll I'm beginning to suspect that the bouncy little beat--and probably the dinky little lyrics--come with the package.
"
FALSE,B-,Behind Closed Doors,Charlie Rich,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7634,"
I welcome the title hit not just because it's richly deserved but because it makes love and marriage seem exciting enough to break out of Nashville. But the album is a typical Music Row mediocrity. Love and marriage is Rich's natural subject at this stage of his career (life, I mean), but to limit him to it is counterproductive--part of the excitement of the bond is what happens outside its circle, and I don't mean cheating.

It's a thin line between ooh and ick, and when he starts saying bum for ass (butt, buns, behind, backside, rear end, tush, I'll even settle for bottom) you can figure the feybirds have flitted off with another album. I like Walter Johnson myself, but Jonathan should realize that maybe Vincent van Gogh deserved to be called an asshole.

FALSE,B-,It's Time for . . .,Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8286,"

FALSE,B-,I Live Here,Ritual Tension,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8288,"
""Here"" is the Lower East Side, and they're talking to (or yelling at) you, Ms. ""Social Climber""--or, more generally, Person Who Doesn't Live on the Lower East Side. Surprisingly, this parochial approach is good for music more intense and universal than, to choose the relevant example, the Bush Tetras' ""Too Many Creeps."" Unsurprisingly, it's also good for doomy drivel.

FALSE,B-,Roachford,Roachford,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6185,"
Between Brit trendies and American neocons, you'd think this strong-voiced black Free fan was the next Terence Trent. But TT gets over on formal spark and a sense of manifest destiny. Absent both, quality here is a function of the songwriting, which while it hits the occasional phrase isn't any more revealing in its clarity than TT's in its opacity.
"
FALSE,B-,Big Time,Smokey Robinson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11836,"
Smokey has a right to the romanticism that has saturated his solo career--deepening ick with vocal dimension has always been his metier--but I can't get behind it. So, admiration aside, I actually like this candidly discoid soundtrack throwaway more than I do A Quiet Storm, Smokey's Family Robinson, and so forth. But it does squander much plastic.
"
FALSE,B-,Blame It on Love and All the Great Hits,Smokey Robinson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8296,"
Not only does it follow dubious recent biz practice by baiting/larding the compilation with three previously unreleased ""hits""-by-association, it leads with them. Not only do all three follow dubious recent Smokey practice by farming out his songwriting, all three are stiffs. So this is hardly the reintroduction those who deserted him in 1968 or 1975 could use. And the corporate vice-president in him approved the whole deal.

FALSE,B-,No Trespassing,The Roches,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8300,"

"
FALSE,B-,My Zydeco Shoes Got the Zydeco Blues,Rockin' Sydney,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8302,"
All over America eccentrics match doggerel to jingle and then importune song publishers for their pot of gold. Sidney Simien commits his creations to vinyl, but with his big talk of ""Sidney's hits"" and ""Talkin' over,"" his world is no less wishful, except for one thing--he made his breakthrough. A small one, to be sure, but however you spell it ""My Toot-Toot"" shows off his sporadic lyrical flair and is already a New Orleans standard. Not that there's any compelling reason to hear the way Sidney does it, especially since he plays all the instruments himself (drums last, sounds like). His album is of value primarily as a specimen of guileless folk ambition, of a man struggling to adapt a local tradition to what he understands of the great outside.
"
FALSE,B-,Sol Negro,Virginia Rodrigues,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4126,"
Notes by Caetano Veloso, who's clearly stunned at the ability of the daughter of a street vendor to evoke ""operas, masses, lieder, and spirituals,"" a response shared by many Lusophiles and every fan of the Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir who's in on the story. The rest of us will be stupefied that such a ""celestial"" voice can exist at all. She never stretches her rich, Ella-like highs into a scat--though the few midtempo numbers have a nice jazzy lilt (dig that berimbau), her instincts are exceedingly solemn. Veloso is Veloso, which means he ""transcends the distinction between erudite and popular"" far more vividly than he thinks Rodrigues does. High middlebrows Djavan and Milton Nascimento don't, and their cameos give the game away.

FALSE,B-,Hot Rocks 1964-1971,The Rolling Stones,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7656,"
If you don't like the Stones, this might serve as a sampler--the only dubious cut is the live ""Midnight Rambler."" But if you don't like the Stones, why are you reading this book? Look, here's how it works. Except for Satanic Majesties, which isn't represented here, all of their '60s studio albums are musts. Couldn't even tell you where to start. Now!, maybe. Or Let It Bleed. Aftermath? Beggars Banquet?
"
FALSE,B-,"""Still Life"" (American Tour 1981)",The Rolling Stones,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8305,"
They sound very professional, they also sound big and rough and raunchy, and with Charlie driving and Keith making dirty noises they transform ""Let Me Go"" from an emotional vacuum to a ready-made classic. But ""Twenty Flight Rock"" has been done better by Robert Gordon (also Eddie Cochran) and the two Motown covers are disgraceful, primarily because of Mick, who has progressed from aging self-parody to old rouï¿½ï""Satisfaction"" sounded more worldly-wise in 1965 (also fresher), and the same goes for every other remake here.
"
FALSE,B-,Steel Wheels,The Rolling Stones,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3844,"
All rancor and bad vibes, Dirty Work was the Stones; all impartiality and bad boys grown up, the reunion is an amazing simulation. Charlie's groove enlivens--and IDs--the mature sentiments while gibes at ""conscience"" and ""reason"" hint obliquely at self-awareness. But for Mick, self-awareness means above all accepting one's status as a pop star. Maybe he thinks ""So get off the fence/It's creasing your butt"" saves ""Mixed Emotions"" from its own conventionality. Probably he thinks giving Keith two vocals is democracy and roots. Certainly he thinks he needs the money. Wrong, wrong, and wrong again.
"
FALSE,B-,Holding Out My Love to You,Max Romeo,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8308,"
You get a reggae pro who's always shown good pop sense, you get producer Keith Richards doubling on gittar, you get Sly &amp; Robbie &amp;c., and what do you get? You get the Kingston equivalent of an ordinary Philly International album, which is better than ordinary Motown, not as good as ordinary Stax.
"
FALSE,B-,Linda Ronstadt,Linda Ronstadt,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7663,"
In which she makes a silk purse out of Silk Purse, not such a great idea--smoother, better crafted, more beautiful, and decidedly less interesting. Hardcore country songs are down to three, and here's the giveaway: four entries from the Sensitivity Squad (Jackson Browne, Livingston Taylor, and the Erics Kaz and Andersen).
"
FALSE,B-,Different Drum,Linda Ronstadt,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7665,"
With any suggestion that she can rock expunged from this compilation, we get five (out of ten) cuts by the Stone Poneys, the two good ones composed by none other than Michael Nesmith and the worst by Tim Buckley, who inspires her to imitate Joan Baez imitating (if that's necessary) a snooty spinster. We also get Jackson Browne and Livingston Taylor. Hey, maybe she can't rock.
"
FALSE,B-,Hasten Down the Wind,Linda Ronstadt,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7667,"
Linda's always wanted to be a Real Country Singer, but RCS put out two or three LPs like this every year. You know--find some good tunes, round up the gang, and apply formula. Like the great RCS she can be, she comes up with some inspired interpretations: the flair of ""That'll Be the Day"" and ""Crazy"" do justice to the originals, and her version of the title song almost makes you forget its unfortunate title. But you cover Tracy Nelson's ""Down So Low"" at your peril even if you believe not one in ten of your fans remembers it, and the three Karla Bonoff lyrics make her (I mean Karla, but Linda too) sound like such a born loser that I never want to hear anyone sing them again.
"
FALSE,B-,Mad Love,Linda Ronstadt,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12008,"
I had hopes for this album--Linda's always been underrated as a rocker--but it falls way over on the strident side of powerful. The songs could be sharper, although except for ""Justine"" those from Richard Perry's prefab Cretones are more than adequate, but the real problem is the basic fallacy of L.A. punk--Linda doesn't understand that the idea is to use a sledgehammer deftly. This is how Ethel Merman would do Elvis Costello, only Ethel Merman has a better sense of humor. And though the other covers sound pretty good, only ""I Can't Let Go"" fits in conceptually, and I'd rather hear them from Little Anthony or Young Neil or Ye Olde Hollies.
"
FALSE,B-,Diana Ross,Diana Ross,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7679,"
This is a generally catchy album by the sad standards she's settled for, but beyond Ashford &amp; Simpson's gorgeous, mournful ""Ain't Nothin' but a Maybe"" and the seven intoxicating minutes of ""Love Hangover"" it's often catchy-annoying rather than catchy-compelling or at least catchy-fun. Major offenders: ""Theme From Mahogany,"" the boop-nostalgia ""Smile,"" and its clone, ""Kiss Me Now,"" which captures her at her archest. (Catalogue number: M6-861.)
"
FALSE,B-,An Evening With Diana Ross,Diana Ross,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11763,"
The band could be Doc Severinsen's and the rushed tempo medleys are maddening, but the vivacity in this live double-LP is palpable. I haven't gotten such a good idea of what the fuss is about since Lady Sings the Blues.
"
FALSE,B-,"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere",Rossington Collins Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8314,"
Not a rerun. Skynyrd without Ronnie Van Zant isn't Skynyrd, so four survivors regroup under a more accurate name, and even more impressive, honor Van Zant's irreplaceability absolutely--by installing a woman up front. In the happy ending, the woman's singing and writing would be as singular as Van Zant's, but this is real life and real death, and instead Dale Krantz is merely strong and competent in a generalized ""rock"" way--here boogie, there almost art-metal. It's a surprise and a pleasure to hear her timbre on top of those guitars. But only the over-the-top cheating song ""Three Times as Bad"" rises out of the sound.
"
FALSE,B-,At His Best,David Ruffin,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7686,"
Although some blame Ruffin's very intermittent post-Tempts success on deliberate corporate neglect, I've never found even his biggest solo hits all that undeniable--ungrouped, his voice seems overly tense whether it's grinding out grit or reaching for highs. Corporate decay is another matter. The four Tempts songs on this compilation aren't necessary--Ruffin has managed to chart ten songs in the nine years he's been on his own--but they certainly show up the more recent compositions. Seems apt that the best non-Tempts cut was written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, the Berry Gordy/Holland-Dozier-Holland of the '70s.
"
FALSE,B-,Masterjam,Rufus & Chaka,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7692,"
Relieving me of ugly suspicions that the secret of Off the Wall wasn't Michael Jackson but producer Quincy Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton, the same pair pitches in here with much slighter results. In fact, they'd get exactly the kind of demi-jazz you'd expect Quincy Jones to substitute for funk. After all, the band has aspired to demi-jazz for years. Now what I want to know is whether the singer aspires to Flora Purim--the signs are mixed, but her sliding rhythms make me fear the worst.
"
FALSE,B-,Frogs Clogs Krauts and Sprouts,The Rumour,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7694,"
If it's true they wanna be the Band, then what's with the Donald Fagen imitations? (Bob Andrews sings!) And who's doing Walter Becker? (My guess: Brinsley Schwarz.) Expert, quirky, and arresting at first. Then expert and quirky. And do I have to tell you what comes next?

FALSE,B-,A Wizard/A True Star,Todd Rundgren,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3967,"
I'm supposed to complain that for all his wizardry he's not a star yet, but just you wait, he can't miss, the Mozart of his generation, that last a direct quote from a fan who collared me at a concert once. Bushwa. His productivity is a pleasure, but it always makes for mess. Examine the enclosed fifty-odd minutes and you'll find a minor songwriter with major woman problems who's good with the board and isn't saved by his sense of humor.
"
FALSE,B-,Rush Hour,Bobby Rush,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7699,"
A lot of this is fun--I'm delighted to find Leon Huff collaborating with someone who's got funk in his soul, and heartened to hear a protest song about the problem of lost keys. But a lot of it--the witless ""Evil Is,"" the characterless ""Hey, Western Union Man""--is dumber than Kenny Gamble.
"
FALSE,B-,Tom Rush,Tom Rush,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7701,"
Rush was a prophet in the days of folkies rampant, working with Al Kooper and Roosevelt Gook on a side of Chess-style rock and roll in 1966 and beating the crowd to J. Mitchell, J. Taylor, and J. Browne in 1968. Nor was he limited to good ideas--his rich, clear, lithe voice broke into raunch so naturally that his up-and-bluesy ""Something in the Way She Moves"" cut all subsequent versions. But now that his brainstorms have become world currency he seems stuck in the latest folkie fad, high-gloss vocal decorum. And now that everyone's discovering unsung songwriters he's forced to resort to knowns like F. Neil and J.C. Young or unknowables like M. McLaughlin (McLauchlan?) and D. Whiffen (Whitten?). This could be a rut.
"
FALSE,B-,Carney,Leon Russell,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2044,"
Not the radical falloff some report--just slippage, the first side listenable and the second flaky. Not that I expect ""Manhattan Island Serenade"" or ""Cajun Love Song"" to get covered like ""This Masquerade."" And not that I enjoy anything else as much as ""If the Shoe Fits,"" a cheap shot at hangers-on that says more about the performer's lot than ""Tight Rope"" and ""Magic Mirror"" put together.
"
FALSE,B-,Digital Bullet,RZA,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11012,"
Rumors of RZA's musical decline are the kneejerks of spastics. Ghost Dog got him past Bernard Herrmann, and he's produced more Wu albums in the last year and a half than in the previous eight. But as a rapper he's no less a gangsta-in-his-own-mind than Dre or Puffy. To his credit, he seems aware of this. ""Bobby Digital"" is truly a ""character,"" based on the Robert Diggs who fucks bitches and loves bling, and his reggae peacemongering, female-principle antimaterial-ism, and revolutionary rhetoric--that is, the last three tracks on his record--aren't as pro forma as most shows of redeeming social importance. Nevertheless, listening to Bobby plod through his own boasts and brutalisms could make you believe Jay-Z is a good person. Is this the bullet Ghostface's wallet is proof against? Let's hope so.
"
FALSE,B-,Stronger Than Pride,Sade,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6207,"
I'm glad this self-made aristocrat has a human side, but I prefer her image: now that she's singing billets-doux, she's even further from rewarding the concentration she warrants than she used to be. Touching your beloved with a few true cliches is hard enough. For an audience you have to come up with something that doesn't fade into the background like the new age jazz she went pop with.
"
FALSE,B-,Love Deluxe,Sade,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3072,"
I'm unable to find fault with her more memorable songs--keep falling asleep before I've finished the sentence. But I swear on a stack of Billboards that half these nine fail to qualify. That's nine, eight with words, in four years. Would you say she's honing her art to the bone? Or would you say she's a nice person with a million-dollar scam? And how come her Somalian woman ""hurts like brand-new shoes""? Is that, er, ""metaphorical distance""? Are we supposed to clap now?

FALSE,B-,Doug Sahm and Band,Doug Sahm and Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7798,"
Sahm may not be the only completely unselfconscious white rock and roller of the post-Beatles era, but I dare you to name the other one, and that's why Jerry Wexler's part of his cult. But Doug's a talent, not a genius, and a country-rock/country supersession posing as a ""band"" is only going to inhibit him. Despite (hell, including) the new Dylan song, humdrum plus.
"
FALSE,B-,Moonshot,Buffy Sainte-Marie,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7709,"
Because there's something almost perversely machinelike about her vibrato, more Yoko Ono than Judy Collins, I've never been comfortable relegating this particular folkie to the crystal teardrop brigade. Here she finally does something overtly perverse--comes out of Nashville with what sounds in its most interesting moments like an art-pop record (with politics, of course). Those who love or even respect her are dismayed. I say her next step is to take up the Moog.
"
FALSE,B-,Lagartija,Walter Salas-Humara,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6088,"
If this were really an ace songwriter doing his own thing, rather than a long-suffering semipro wondering why his group is short a label deal, he'd showcase songwriting. Instead he concentrates on riff-tunes--pretty good ones that aren't what you'd call propelled by the auteur's overdubbed guitar and drums. Which must mean he's saving the ace stuff for the Silos. Good.
"
FALSE,B-,Caravanserai,Santana,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7715,"
Some of the slower electronic stuff fails to sustain my admittedly tentative interest, and the Gillette commercial vocals take  this post-hippie business altogether too far. Still, I'm happy to report that the experiment--away from Latino schlock and toward Mahavishnu you can dance to, sort of--is not only honest but successful and not only successful but appropriate. After all, improvisation has always been their ""thing.""
"
FALSE,B-,Santana's Greatest Hits,Santana,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7717,"
The problem with their albums turns out to be too complex to be solved by eliminating uninteresting tunes--which is a backhanded compliment to the complexity of their concept. In any case, this compilation reduces their music to a cross between pan-African blooze and Latin-metal pop. The fine (and, er, not so fine) cuts it showcases work better in their original contexts--as heads, lynchpins, focal points of improvisations that are not (yet?) what they should be.

On the back cover is a photograph of three men. Two of them are dressed in white and have their hands folded--one grinning like Alfred E. Neuman, the other looking like he's about to have a Supreme Court case named after him: solemn, his wrists ready for the cuffs. In between, a man in an orange ski jacket and red pants with one white sock seems to have caught his tongue on his lower lip. He looks like the yoga coach at a fashionable lunatic asylum. Guess which one is Sri Chinmoy.

FALSE,B-,Silver Dreams Golden Reality,Devadip Carlos Santana,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7725,"
Frustrating, especially for an earthbound churl like myself--spiritual program music that mixes genuinely celestial rock with the usual goop. The ""title"" song (which for some arcane reason--scansion, probably--substitutes the word ""Smiles"" for ""Reality"")  is an altogether revolting string-fed banality. It's followed by an instrumental on which the guitarist attains his soaring apogee, and a Sri Chinmoy (!) tune--arranged by Narada Michael Walden (!!)--that achieves a natural impressionism Eno (!!!) couldn't hope for. See what I mean?

FALSE,B-,The Best of Savoy Brown,Savoy Brown,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7729,"
More even than John Mayall, this band was the great mean--that is, the mean--of the purist (as opposed to heavy) wing of what we in America once called British blues, and these eight tracks, none recorded after 1972, say it all. ""Train to Nowhere"" is a minor classic, ""A Hard Way to Go"" and maybe one or two others mildly memorable, and that's it for twelve albums. I mean, who wants to hear (third but not last vocalist) Dave Walker sing ""Wang Dang Doodle"" when it's on The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions? And who but an annotator would describe an empty-headed Kim Simmonds guitar solo (over a rhythm section that's simultaneously stolid and shaky) as ""piercing and blistering""?
"
FALSE,B-,Silverbird,Leo Sayer,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7730,"
The musical tricks repeat themselves, but they're good--the sharp, punky growl that accedes so naturally to the vulnerable falsetto, the punch of the drums against the depth of the strings. But the words fail me. Sayer makes much of his mask--a mask so enigmatic that it registers, at best, as a blank. Why then should I wonder what's behind it?
"
FALSE,B-,Another Year,Leo Sayer,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7732,"
Leo sounds so much like Elton this time that I thought I'd finally figured him out, for like Numero Uno he seems very aware that people buy hooks, not words, belting/crooning every lyric with the same synthetic intensity regardless of its worth. The switch to a social realist tack here would then be explained by the presence of new songwriting collaborator Frank Farrell. My problem: Sayer writes the words, Farrell the melodies. Sayer's problem: we love Elton for his megalomania, and megalomania is something you have to earn.

A decade ago now, Boz joined a struggle--the struggle to prove a white man could sing not merely the blues, but their pop equivalent. Between his hippie pipes and his tendency to take things easy, it was hard, but determination shone through his most laid-back music--he stood out partly because few white guys were trying anything so contemporary, and partly because he had to go that extra inch lyrically to make his point. Since Silk Degrees, however, his only struggle has been to stay on top of the new white pop hegemony he helped create. Though he writes better material than Michael McDonald, the difference isn't degree, just taste. And though he's learned a lot about singing--maybe too much--McDonald has better pipes.

Anybody as smart as Schoolly, who on his own testimony turned down a scholarship from Georgia Tech because he only wanted to study art, must be held responsible for his own bullshit, especially if he makes a large part of his living selling black fantasy to white thrill-seekers. Are B-boys really like this? How the fuck am I supposed to know? What I do know is that between his cheeba and his malt liquor and his foldaway dick and his casual ""faggot""s and his eagerness to blame an unspecified cocaine habit on a nameless and maybe even figurative ""white bitch,"" he's the white audience's paranoid-to-masochistic fantasy of a B-boy. He deserves credit for realizing the fantasy so scarily, and for commanding his own tough-guy sound. But that doesn't mean you have to like him.

Significant that two musicians so close to the Flatt-picking roots--though it ought to be remembered that their father is an entertainer, not a mountaineer--have put together such a doleful-sounding country-rock band in the face of the good-time sippin'-that-wine stuff the more famous guys are selling.

Because he can sing and write songs, the newly acquired Randall Bramblett imparts a modicum of pop structure, a relief after the shapeless jazzy boogie of their debut.

This isn't just an honest, rough-and-ready craftsman reverting to form, because he's trying to repeat an inspired, uncharacteristically precise success. So he sounds phony at times, desperate to inject drama into run-of-the-mill material that might work in a more fluid, less fraught-with-meaning live setting. Exception: ""Feel Like a Number,"" in which the banal critique of quantification is renewed by Seger's measured intensity.

In which the la-dees cover P-Funk, recite the Big Mac formula, and advise knocked-up fans to keep doing that body rock after the daddy gets gone--in short, rap wisdom, down-to-earth but not what you'd call an alternative (Medicaid abortions, anyone?). And I probably wouldn't complain if Sugarhill's studio gang gave them as good as they give the boys.

Why are these putative paragons of sexual vulnerability so much more irritating than the rainbow-hued Color Me Badd, the blandly stylish Boyz II Men, or the utterly forgotten Ready for the World? It's not their indifferent singing and rapping, which are only to be expected. It's that they have no class and no sense of humor; they're too smarmy and too slow; they're big phonies. They epitomize the difference between seduction and betrayal--between shared lie and imposed illusion, rascal and bounder, rogue and complete asshole. There's not a winning wink on the entire album. And only ""Waiting for the Day"" (""When you can spend the night"") offers up a fantasy with any educational potential for the fine females who lap up their shit.

With its positive party line, international beats, ensemble vocals, and tributes to P-Funk, Sun Ra, and Sly, this may well be the first rap album that fully expresses the ideals and ideas of the group with its name on the cover--or at least of its esteemed leader, who happens to be Afrika Bambaataa. But because not one member of the ensemble (or all of them together) qualifies as any kind of grandmaster, and because Material's best rap track is still by Tribe II, the cuts that open each side (functionally enough, too) never even broke through as twelve-inches. And whatever they express, ""Thank You"" and ""Let's Party Down"" are filler.

Her pleasantly expressive voice free of inconvenient conviction, she slips unassumingly from stance to stance--fantasy lover to wronged Cosmo Girl to horny wildcat to committed lifemate.

""Canada's most critically acclaimed new artist"" says the sticker, but you know Canadians--they lose their heads when a native evinces the merest soupcon of originality. She's even been compared to Laurie Anderson, I guess because she's abstract sometimes. I'll say. How thoroughly she's transcended what I'm sure was a careful upbringing is summed up in a statement of aesthetic principle that I swear is unsullied by the tiniest smudge of irony: ""Symmetry is the way things have to be.""

Interesting music is the perfect cover for mediocre literature. Many serious pop fans, especially genteel ones, are so hungry for tokens of intelligence that they'll cut slack for anyone who transcends the quatrain, pondering sung imagery they wouldn't glance at in a slim volume. If you skip ""Sweet Incarnadine"" (""edited down from a 20 min. improvisation,"" God help us), this isn't altogether horrible. Siberry has a sense of shape and texture; there are clever glints of informality in her presentation; her passion shows more smarts and decency than most. But her settings are only settings. And her words are only intelligent.

I hedged last time for fear this group would turn into an annoyance if they got big, but they didn't. Instead they persist as an odd classic, instantly identifiable within a notoriously homogeneous genre, replacing soft disco's characteristic baby-oil flow with an endearingly square herky-jerk. Unfortunately, this collection necessitates a more serious hedge, on grounds of material (""songs"" seems to arty a term). They should have borrowed ""Lady Bump"" and ""Big Bad Boy"" from Penny McLean, whose bland vocalizing is best buried in the mix, as it is here, rather than showcased on a ""solo"" album.

The soundtrack to a going-nowhere flick about an over-the-hill rocker that he scripted, starred in, and of course scored is also his first true album in five years, and while it's literate, tasteful, etc., it's also--self-evidently--the work of a man who thinks he's too big for music (at five-foot-two, gosh). So if individual songs don't stand out the way they have ever since ""The Sound of Silence,"" maybe he doesn't work as hard at them anymore. Like so many aging folkies he's devolved into a vaguely jazzy pop, and except for the lead cut and the one with Ray Charles on it everything serves the excuse for a groove.

Carried along on David Matthews's uncharacteristically infectious arrangement, Simone's version of one of Randy Newman's more perfunctory American-names songs is a glorious fluke on the order of Baez's ""Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."" I'm glad, though, that it's available as a single, because unlike owner-annotator Creed Taylor I don't find that Simone's ""magnificent intensity . . . turns everything--even the most simple, mundane phrase or lyric--into a radiant, poetic message."" On the contrary, her penchant for the mundane renders her intensity as bogus as her mannered melismas and pronunciation (move over, Inspector Clouseau) and the rote flatting of her vocal improvisations. There are several good cuts here; the song selection is often inspired (Hurley-Witkins's ""The Family,"" perfect). But a woman who not only avoids coming out with the ""bitch"" in ""Rich Girl"" but hobbles the rhythm as well has real problems.

Wayne Robins clued me in on why I wasn't connecting with these sly, solid, snappy songs when he told me they reminded him of Freddie and the Dreamers. Right--it's Freddie evolved from teen lies to pop candor, effetely nasty rather than revoltingly cute, acknowledging his own little failings and hostilities in a mildly remorseless voice. And sly, solid, and snappy for all that.

From thumping stop-and-go bottom to gleeful Beatle allusions, the title track is the most far-out piece of music to break pop all year, and you keep waiting for the rest to go . . . somewhere, if not all the way.

With the pump organ and all she does have Her Own Sound, especially if you don't remember Nico too clearly--and unlike Nico, she also has a sense of humor. But antiurban survivalists rarely like people much. And quiet as it's kept, agape is a richer musical wellspring than nonconformity.

All pop propaganda to the contrary, Pat DiNizio's no surefire songwriter--he's only moderately hooky, and even the lyrics he hits encapsulates romantic situations you already know the ins and outs of.

Morrissey's slightly skewed relationship to time and pitch codes his faint melodies at least as much as Johnny Marr's much-heralded real guitar. What's turned him into an instant cult hero, though, is his slightly unskewed relationship to transitory sex--the boy really seems to take it hard. If you'll pardon my long memory, it's the James Taylor effect all over again--hypersensitivity seen as a spiritual achievement rather than an affliction by young would-be idealists who have had it to here with the cold cruel world.

I'm probably overrating this record a little. Certainly there are times when its big, every-hair-in-place production makes the big, barely controllable emotions she's going for sound hopelessly false, and from rejected partner Billy Steinberg to new producer Rick Chertoff, the songcraft is manufactured Springsteen. Yet something just slightly bruised in Smyth's big voice recalls the pop axiom that manufacture and integrity aren't mutually exclusive. Kind of like with Katrina Leskanich, only not so's you'd play the album on your own free will. And most would say I overrate Katrina Leskanich.

Snoopy's evolution into an E! cartoon is one of those regrettable trajectories of public taste that tricks get carried away by and hos ride for all they're worth. It's not just, as Tom Breihan observed in Pitchfork, that musically he runs a production line like Tom Petty or Alan Jackson. It's that he trivializes his own content--not the gangsta, braggadocio no one takes seriously anymore, but the pimp slime. People--there are no cute pimps. It's a contradiction in terms. Hustle &amp; Flow I buy. But that's not Calvin Broadus' movie. His movie is a Dreamgirls where Jamie Foxx wins. So for Rolling Stone to give this four stars with long lean Barack Obama all over its cover represents a rather sickening cultural disconnect. The one great song here isn't the cyberporn hit job ""Sexual Eruption"" or the Prince copyright that Morris Day still owns, but the demented Johnny Cash tribute ""My Medicine,"" not least for this Inspirational Verse: ""Girl my love's gonna last just as long as I'm high/You can trust every word I tell you is a lie.""

The record of the year on the disco circuit earns its title by rejecting the washes of strings and brass outsiders associate with the form for a consciously minimalist exploration of mechanical dance rhythm, devoid of even the appearance of melody or meaningfulness.

Karl Jenkins, whose horns and keyboards replace Elton Dean's alto, provides the band's best track since ""Moon in June"": ""The Soft Weed Factor,"" in which a tiny piano riff builds through dozens (hundreds?) of repetitions into a rocking and roiling modular extravaganza. But with Robert Wyatt gone for two albums now, most of the rest is jazz or no discernible inspiration. Mike Ratledge sounds thinner every time out--I kept wondering if I'd blown a channel.

Supposedly, his ""reinterpretations"" of his own ""classics""--acoustic ""Born To Run,"" E Street ""Tougher Than the Rest""--have a demythologizing effect, but years of enormous rooms have finally taken their spiritual toll; the self-importance he's always accused of drips from his all-American drawl like Vitalis off a D.A. He's staved off this fate for as long as he has with modest strokes like Nebraska, and it's conceivable he'll come up with another one. Then again, this was probably supposed to be another one.

FALSE,B-,Argybargy,Squeeze,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8425,"
Popophiles Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook don't settle for have-fun fall-in-love fear-girls. They pen short stories worthy of early Rupert Holmes, and with a beat (alternate title: Herkyjerky). 'Tis said McCartneyesque tunefulness is the ticket here, but to me Tilbrook sounds more like Ray Davies after est--at peace with himself and out for big bucks, pounds being a foregone conclusion.
"
FALSE,B-,Babylon and On,Squeeze,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8428,"
The most noticeable of Difford &amp; Tilbrook Mark II's three LPs is a case study in pop-star devolution, suffused with the regrets of successful young professionals who drink too much liquor, smoke too many cigarettes, and don't want to be alone any more. Their best song is about how they really don't understand Americans, most of the rest leech off love lives that comprise long successions of small failures, and where once they were storytellers, now they've withdrawn into metaphor--surprisingly murky metaphor for such detail specialists, with lots of time references.
"
FALSE,B-,Hot,Squirrel Nut Zippers,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3266,"
They cut their second album live to a single mike because they don't just love old jazz--they love old jazz records, which is also why Katharine Whalen thinks the way to channel Billie Holiday and Betty Boop is to scrunch up your tonsils. However sincerely they disavow nostalgia, they're not good enough to escape it--striving for the life they hear on those records, they're neither acute enough musically nor blessed enough culturally to get closer than a clumsy imitation. Mix in a soupcon of postloungecore eleganza and you end up with a band that's damn lucky to have written a couple of dandy songs. And if they purloined that calypso novelty hit they put their name on, I hope the teeth that get extruded are their own.
"
FALSE,B-,Be Altitude: Respect Yourself,Staple Singers,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7852,"
Musically, this is a triumph of the Staples' evolving pop style. The arrangements fit, and Roebuck and Mavis have never sounded more at home. But despite ""I'll Take You There,"" a lot of the material is as silly as the contorted title pun. Even ""Respect Yourself,"" you will recall, has that line about stopping pollution by coughing into your hand.
"
FALSE,B-,Clean,Edwin Starr,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7860,"
Disco! Where do its hits go? Absolutely nowhere! But they do give deserving old soul singers another moment, now don't they?
"
FALSE,B-,Ringo,Ringo Starr,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7863,"
This is not a Beatles album but a Ringo album--a likable curiosity. Ringo's droll sincerity was always good for a change of pace; his songs were wonderful in context. Here that context is provided by an occasional harmony (especially John's on ""I'm the Greatest"") that makes me long for much, much more. It might be different if the songs were all as good as ""Photograph,"" but without a real singer to work with, Richard Perry cannot transmute questionable material into magic. And don't kid yourself--the Beatles could.
"
FALSE,B-,Goodnight Vienna,Ringo Starr,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7864,"
The title tune is great Ringo, as is ""No No Song,"" and he does well enough with the rest of this well-chosen material, the exceptions being the three tunes he had a hand in writing himself. But the supersession form is deadening. Beaucoups of Blues took some initiative.
"
FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits,Steely Dan,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7873,"
This picks what's worth picking off The Royal Scam, adds the negligible ""Here in the Western World"" to their output, and leaves ""FM"" on FM, which I consider parsimonious. Essential music in a superfluous configuration.
"
FALSE,B-,Gaucho,Steely Dan,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3316,"
With Walter Becker down to composer credits and very occasional bass, Donald Fagen progresses toward the intellectual cocktail rock he's sought for almost a decade--followed, of course, by a cadre of top-drawer El Lay studio hacks, the only musicians in the world smart enough to play his shit. Even the song with Aretha in it lends credence to rumors that the LP was originally entitled Countdown to Lethargy. After half a dozen hearings, the most arcane harmonies and unlikely hooks sound comforting, like one of those electromassagers that relax the muscles with a low-voltage shock. Craftsmen this obsessive don't want to rule the world--they just want to make sure it doesn't get them.
"
FALSE,B-,Connected,Stereo MC's,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3325,"
Rap with an international face. Techno with a human face. Disco with a postmodern face. Techno-rap disco with a pop face. Pleasant. Beatwise. So multifaceted its functionality is fungible and forgettable.
"
FALSE,B-,Mona Bone Jakon,Cat Stevens,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7878,"
As an admirer of ""Matthew and Son"" and ""I Love My Dog,"" two rock songs we should have heard more of in 1967, I made Cat my token singer-songwriter when this came out--the melodies were memorable, the dry intimacy of the singing had a nice post-creative-trauma feel, and I liked ""Katmandu,"" which was about the physical (rather than spiritual) geography of a religious quest. Only later did I notice ""Lady D'Arbanville"" (his girlfriend), ""Trouble"" (too much for him), and ""I Wish, I Wish"" (a map of his soul).
"
FALSE,B-,Tea for the Tillerman,Cat Stevens,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=553,"
My big problems with this record are no doubt why it's a hit: the artificially ripened singing, which goes down like a store-bought banana daiquiri, and the insufferable sexist condescension of ""Wild World.""
"
FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits,Cat Stevens,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7881,"
Stevens has more spunk and verve than any other singer-songwriter I dislike. He's unpretentious yet harmonically idiosyncratic, with nice dissonances and a rocking chunka beat. He can be charming about things that really are nice, like dawn, and a few of the many songs he has written about his own confusion have a winning je-ne-sais-quoi. Unfortunately, for such a confused person, though, most things aren't really nice, and when ""the world as it is"" isn't driving him to tears (""Peace Train"") he often lies about it.
"
FALSE,B-,Year of the Cat,Al Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7884,"
Rather than gothics or sci-fi, Stewart goes for historical novels, and as long as he shuts up about Nostradamus--who inspired last year's Past, Present and Future, you'll remember--I say good for him. Well, actually the historical note is limited this time out to one song about Lord Grenville and references to Leonardo, phantom harlequins, etc. The prevailing tone is more spy-novel. I ask you, did Eric Ambler have an ear for melody?
"
FALSE,B-,Cactus and a Rose,Gary Stewart,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8440,"
Getting treatment for writer's block, in for commercial retooling, whatever--the man in the black hat has been shuffled off to affably self-aggrandizing Memphis country/soul/rock/biz legend Chips Moman, who put him together with a couple of Allmans and a whole side of Chips Moman songs. The title tune has something to do with a New York penthouse, and what the hell this hard-drinking redneck is doing there nobody can figure out. Overdisc the country-rock is more billy and more swamp and sounds almost like old times on the only Stewart song included, the title of which encapsulates his poetic gifts: ""How Could We Come to This After That."" How indeed.
"
FALSE,B-,Brotherly Love,Gary Stewart & Dean Dillon,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8441,"
They have two good reasons to try to make buddyful music together--Gary's goin' down and Dean's comin' up--and they work at it manfully enough. But the disappointments begin with the jacket, where Gary sports a medallion (wore hippie beads in the good old days), and are symbolized by a slickly lascivious title hit that sums up the honky tonk as singles bar.
"
FALSE,B-,Smiler,Rod Stewart,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7889,"
Except for an embarrassingly unnatural ""Natural Man"" (that's right, Aretha's), the failure here is elusive, but that doesn't make it any less real--spiritual tone, energy, horns, something like that. For me, the better part of valor is to give up before the Elton John track wears out the way the Sam Cooke stuff and ""Dixie Toot"" already have.
"
FALSE,B-,The Best of Rod Stewart Volume II,Rod Stewart,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7893,"
Special price, says a simulated sticker on the jacket, but that's the only thing on this ragbag that's worth a glad hand. A fast shuffle, not a fair deal.
"
FALSE,B-,Foot Loose and Fancy Free,Rod Stewart,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7894,"
Gosh, what a terrific idea--a concept album about a cocksure rock and roller who Cannot Love. How'd all those cliches get in there, I wonder. I mean, the first side works up a very nice groove, although it'll add nothing to Rod's reputation as a composer or a humanitarian. But side two opens with a Vanilla Fudge remake and doesn't recover till the confessional finale, itself festooned midway through with a ""Whoo!"" so pro forma you'd think Rod had run out of steam.
"
FALSE,B-,High on You,Sly Stone,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7902,"
The lyrics haven't regained their punch, and neither have the melodies--when he does try to say something, you barely notice. But the old rhythmic eccentricity, both vocal and instrumental, makes this more interesting to listen to than the run of dancey goop. Let's not give up on him yet.
"
FALSE,B-,Ten Years Too Soon,Sly Stone,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7903,"
Pieties aside, John Luongo does better with this monstrous concept--segueing ""contemporary"" instrumental stylings into Sly's (not the Family's) greatest dance tracks--than you'd expect, and the album is at least a listenable curiosity. I mean, it's funny to hear a kickdrum-syndrum break follow the familiar ""for people who only need a beat."" And ""High on You"" is actually improved. But of course, the concept failed--this got virtually no disco play. And Greatest Hits is still in catalogue.
"
FALSE,B-,Stoneground,Stoneground,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7904,"
People exercise themselves calling this a hype, but I've heard a lot worse and am happy to wish them humility and dues. Certainly the aptest use of Sal Valentino since the Beau Brummels were on Autumn (the Beau Brummels on Warners were my idea of a hype). In the best moment, Valentino's fake-dirty vocals interlock with a real dirty song called ""Stroke Stand.""
"
FALSE,B-,The Stone Roses,The Stone Roses,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3871,"
These Britindie pheenoms are overhyped for sure, so there's a temptation to blow them off. What do they do that the Byrds and the Buffalo Springfield weren't doing better in 1967? And that a hundred Amerindie bands don't do just as well now? But they aren't all press clips--they're postmodern English, filtering folk-rock romanticism through Joy Division and Jesus and Mary Chain hyperromanticism. Though they have their moments as songwriters--""Bye Bye Badman"" always stops me, and ""I Want To Be Adored"" sums them up--their music is about sound, fingers lingering over the strings and so forth. And in the end they're surprisingly ""eclectic."" Not all that good at it, but eclectic.
"
FALSE,B-,Core,Stone Temple Pilots,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5897,"
Once you learn to tell them from the Stoned Tempo Pirates, the Stolen Pesto Pinenuts, the Gray-Templed Prelates, Temple of the Dog, Pearl Jam, and Wishbone Ash, you may decide they're a halfway decent hard rock act. Unfortunately, sometime after they've set you up with their best power chords, you figure out the title is ""Sex Type Thing"" because it's attached to a rape threat. They claim this was intended as a critique, kind of like ""Naked Sunday""'s sarcastic handshake with authority. But at best that means they should reconceive their aesthetic strategy--critiquewise, irony has no teeth when the will to sexual power still powers your power chords. And if it's merely the excuse MTV fans have reason to suspect, the whole band should catch AIDS and die.
"
FALSE,B-,Built for Speed,Stray Cats,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8450,"
Though the soft, shuffling bottom makes up in volume what it lacks in angle of attack and Brian Setzer integrates quite an array of modernistic exotica into his pickin', the mild vocals just ain't rockabilly. You know how it is when white boys strive for authenticity--'57 V-8 my ass.
"
FALSE,B-,Rant n' Rave With the Stray Cats,Stray Cats,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8451,"
I love the sound of this record--it's much bigger and rawer, as if Built for Speed's prettification was just to get over. Only an ideologue would deny that these unlikely pop stars tear into rockabilly readymades with twice the gusto of any purists or authentics now recording. And Brian Setzer is the snazziest guitarist to mine the style since James Burton. But he's also a preening panderer, mythologizing his rockin' '50s with all the ignorant cynicism of a punk poser. He's no singer, no actor, no master of persona. And if he can write songs he didn't bother.
"
FALSE,B-,The Way We Were,Barbra Streisand,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7917,"
Theoretically, I am encouraged by Barbra's abandonment of Richard Perry and Contemporary Material, and in practice I love the title song, one of those beyootiful ballads that are the gift of AM programming to the reprobate rock and roller. But my big theory has always been that we like contemporary material because it is, well, contemporary, and in practice most of these performances generate a pristine, somewhat chill unreality even as they simulate warmth, maturity, all that stuff. Also, I'm not humming any of them after half a dozen plays.
"
FALSE,B-,Credit in Heaven,The Suburbs,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8457,"
A band takes a chance when they follow up an offbeat but well-received debut with a double-LP and a lyric sheet--gives strangers the chance to get to know them. My considered conclusion is that for all his presence Blaire John Chaney is rather more affected than his quota of mother wit makes altogether seemly. His arch cynicism looks gratuitous up close, as arch cynicism usually does. Talented? Mais oui. Not talented enough to fill a double album and a lyric sheet, though.
"
FALSE,B-,Life's Too Good,The Sugarcubes,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5819,"
Their sense of mischief isn't just playful--it's experimental and a little wicked. It's also so imperfectly realized that you have to infer it out from underneath their breathy swoops, willful shifts and starts, and translated lyrics--so imperfectly realized that most of their fans, critics included, barely notice it. Which means that on the level of attention they deserve (and get), they're either a cult band to the max or vaguely irritating pop exotics.
"
FALSE,B-,Floored,Sugar Ray,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5212,"
Crude for sure, without anything to say or much to say it with, they nevertheless have some punky life to them, which I say is enhanced by their blatant ska and hip hop rips. What's most depressing about them is that their success makes sense--they're the nearest thing to a fresh young rock band the market or the ""underground"" has kicked up this year. Not counting Radish, of course.
"
FALSE,B-,Make a Record,The Suicide Commandos,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7927,"
The hooks are buried even further into the mix than the vocals and the drumming, but they're there somewhere, and I must admit that every time I hear the opening chords of either side I sit up and grin. For punk junkies only.

Did you come yet? Huh? Did you come yet?
"
FALSE,B-,I Remember Yesterday,Donna Summer,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1065,"
Cut of the month is ""Love's Unkind,"" a remake of ""Then He Kissed Me"" that I prefer to the original for the way its solo saxophone opens a window in the wall of sound. But the Supremes and Dr. Buzzard (and Natalie Cole?) takeoffs are stale if not stuffy, and when Kraftwerk goes to the disco the best you can usually hope for is air conditioning.
"
FALSE,B-,"""Once Upon a Time . . .""",Donna Summer,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1066,"
Roll over Pete Townshend and tell Jerry Leiber the news--here's the first disco opera, a double-LP concept album with actual lyrics that tell an actual story printed on the inner sleeves. First two sides are uniformly strong but without real peaks, and from there it's downhill to a climax indicated by the two final titles, ""I Love You"" and ""Happily Ever After."" But you can dance to it.
"
FALSE,B-,The Sweet,The Sweet,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7944,"
In which Phil Wainman, Mike Chapman, and Nicky Chinn ask the musical question: is heavy bubblegum bazooka-rock? Their answer: only when it goes pop. So while I'm as impressed as anyone with the success of ""Little Willy,"" I want to know what happened to ""Blockbuster."" Not to mention ""Wig-Wam Bam.""
"
FALSE,B-,Desolation Boulevard,The Sweet,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3878,"
Bazooka-rock lives, even without Chapman and Chinn. In the absence of Slade (whose failure to participate on the recent LP that bears their name must be considered disquieting), these guys play second-bill steamroller to Kiss.
"
FALSE,B-,Afterbirth of the Cool,Swollen Monkeys,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8466,"
I've been a fan of the irrepressible Ralph Carney since Tin Huey, but he doesn't have a bandleader's sense of purpose. Moderately entertaining on stage with its four or five horns and almost as many clever lyrics, his polka-to-salsa ""world rhythms"" outfit comes perilously close to mess on record, where you can't see how unpretentious their highjinks are. If sidemen are gonna goof around, better they should be smart, nice sidemen. But not that much better.
"
FALSE,B-,Best of the Sylvers,The Sylvers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7946,"
They were nice enough to program this fast-side/slow-side. Now if only the fast side didn't fade from ""Boogie Fever"" and ""Hot Line"" (by Lewis &amp; Perren) to ""Cotton Candy"" (add Yarian) to ""High School Dance"" (Switch to four Sylvers) to ""Free Style"" (switch to one Sylver).
"
FALSE,B-,Living Proof,Sylvester,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7951,"
The three concert sides are what Sylvester wants--his graduation from disco into the world of Thelma Houston and the Pointer Sisters. But insofar as he succeeds artistically he does so on effort, not achievement--he simply can't generate the requisite vocal lustre so far above his speaking register. And insofar as he succeeds commercially he does so on the strength of the studio (i.e., disco) side--which succeeds pretty well artistically, too.
"
FALSE,B-,Sylvester and the Hot Band,Sylvester and the Hot Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7947,"
In which everybody's favorite black transvestite internalizes songs by Neil Young (""Southern Man""), James Taylor (""Steamroller""), and Procul Harum (guess) as well as Ray Charles (not bad, in its way) and Billie Holiday (and people complain about Diana Ross). ""Southern Man"" is almost unrecognizable in its rock-funk arrangement, which is interesting, and if you think Sweet Baby Wimp sounds funny invoking a ""churnin' urn of burnin' funk"" just imagine those words from a cartoon character who is three-fourths Tweety Bird and one-fourth--well, it is the puddy tat's name--Sylvester. Finale: a Stax-Volt ""My Country 'Tis of Thee."" Quite a curiosity.
"
FALSE,B-,Blackjack Choir,James Talley,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1656,"
Populism always has a sentimental side, but here the received images take over: bluesmen singin' sad songs and everybody lovin' love songs, lasses from Georgia and broken dreams from Chicago. His voice is richer, and ""Magnolia Boy"" and ""When the Fiddler Packs His Case"" are as great as anything from the first two albums, but I hope this is a lapse.
"
FALSE,B-,Sky-High!,Tavares,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7961,"
In the tradition of the produced group, they make hit singles, not albums, and In the City was apparently a fluke. This time they've switched to Freddie Perren, whose affinity for the transcendantly awkward lyric, best represented on the Miracles' City of Angels, here produces such gems as ""The mighty power of love/It's got more force than any shove"" and ""Son you gotta give a heck/You gotta promise to give respect."" Three fine tunes, four or five drecky ones.
"
FALSE,B-,With Friends and Neighbors,Alex Taylor,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7962,"
I figure it's time I come out with it. I hate James Taylor and I don't trust any of his damn family either. But if I had to choose I think I'd take Alex--he sounds kinda bluesy, like he's in it for the money.
"
FALSE,B-,Sweet Baby James,James Taylor,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7964,"
I have solved the Taylor Perplex, which seems to revolve around whether James was a verier godsend when he was gracing Macdougal Street with the Flying Machine, discovering the Beatles on Apple, or now. My answer: none of the above. Which leaves an even more perplexing question: which god is supposed to have sent him? Not the one in Rock and Roll Heaven, that's for sure.
"
FALSE,B-,One Step Beyond,Johnnie Taylor,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7970,"
In which Taylor delivers a love sermon and works his two themes for two hits. ""Jody's Got Your Girl and Gone"" is a memorable addition to the mythology of infidelity, but ""I Am Somebody"" is at best a competent black pride riff in biracial drag--like the rest, nothing to be ashamed of rather than something to be proud of.
"
FALSE,B-,Taylored in Silk,Johnnie Taylor,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7971,"
With the aid of Wade Marcus's gloopy strings, this is where Taylor goes pop, and though he's trying for silk it sounds like the same old polyester--eight songs stretched over thirty-three minutes, including one soul-wringer hit, one blues-talking hit, and filler, much of which does have a certain reflective charm.
"
FALSE,B-,Reunion,The Temptations,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8480,"
Motown has put a lot into this event, with Berry, Smokey, and even Rick pitching in on new songs, but since most of the leads remain with Dennis Edwards, who led the Tempts into the nightclubs, it's possible to forget that David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks are back. Edwards demonstrates his professionalism by not breaking into giggles during ""I've Never Been to Me,"" but when he proclaims loyalty to the ""punk funk"" on James's entry, the best-sung George Clinton rip ever, I simply don't believe him.
"
FALSE,B-,100cc,10cc,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7990,"
It can't be easy to put together a compilation album that's less listenable than either of the two regular-issue LPs to which you have access, but displaced impresario Jonathan King, trailing kisses in the direction of ""I'm Not in Love"" (which he doesn't control) and ""Everyone's Gone to the Moon,"" does the trick here with the help of a few B sides. Secretly, I suspect, King still hopes to score a schlock smash like the two aforementioned, so instead of sticking to the uptempo burlesques that are 10cc's entree to the human race he gives a lot of their art-school slow stuff a second shot. And comes up with zilch.
"
FALSE,B-,Secrets of the I Ching,"10,000 Maniacs",1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8481,"
True enough, these new-wave art-folkies don't sound like anybody else, including their kissing cousins in R.E.M. Reason one is Robert Buck on ""principal guitars devices,"" all delightful space effects and airily elliptical hooks. But reason two is Natalie Merchant and her equally airy ""voice."" Not only does Natalie inflect the English language as if she grew up speaking some Polynesian tongue, but she writes lyrics to match, lyrics which from the crib sheet I'd adjudge the most sophomoric poetry-of-pretension to hit pop music since lysergic acid was in flower. Random stanza: ""Patrons in attendance/To disarm a common myth/Homage paid to the victor of immortality/Cloaked in bold tones."" Jesus.
"
FALSE,B-,In My Tribe,"10,000 Maniacs",1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8482,"
Natalie Merchant's nasal art-folk drawl isn't altogether intolerable, and her ""Peace Train"" cover sets up dippier expectations than her new lyrics deserve. Signalling her professionalism by deprivatizing her metaphors, she actually says something about illiteracy, today's army, and cruelty to children. In private, however, she remains a Cat Stevens fan with a nasal art-folk drawl.
"
FALSE,B-,Blind Man's Zoo,"10,000 Maniacs",1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5796,"
Natalie Merchant has her own prosaic prosody, with off-kilter guitar accentuating its eccentric undertow. The whole second side makes politics not love, and sometimes--like when the lottery-playing mom of ""Dust Bowl"" rubs her fevered youngest down with rubbing alcohol--she brings you there. But somehow I knew that when she got down to cases she'd still be a fuzzy-wuzzy. This is a woman whose song about Africa (called ""Hateful Hate,"" now there's a resonant phrase) brushes by slavery on its way to elephanticide and ends up condemning ""curiosity""--again and again. No wonder she won't listen to ""common sense firm arguments.""
"
FALSE,B-,Cricklewood Green,Ten Years After,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7993,"
Despite Leo Lyons's responsive bass and Ric Lee's reliable drums, it's obviously the speed and tensile tone of Alvin Lee's guitar that makes this music what it is--pure boogie, a style which benefits from impurities. As such, it's best experienced on Undead. Alvin sings pretty well, but his songwriting is barely serviceable, which puts the ordinary amenities of studio pop beyond his means.

In which the rock heavy comes of age with his toughest, fullest, and most coherent album. I like it in a way, but it does lack a certain winning abandon, and I'm not crazy about the heavy's economic theories--fellow seems to believe that if you ""tax the rich to feed the poor"" you soon run out of rich, with dire consequences.
"
FALSE,B-,I Gotcha,Joe Tex,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7997,"
Joe's rhythms have gotten a lot trickier since the days of ""Show Me"" and ""Skinny Legs,"" which is probably the real reason the title tune was such a smash--the story line isn't up to his vintage stuff even if Joe was moved to restate it for a finale. Granted, I did turn up the treble to find out what he was asking her to do in ""You Said a Bad Word"" (still don't know). But beyond that there's only--talk about common touch--""Bad Feet,"" which has nothing to do, narratively, with getting on the good one.
"
FALSE,B-,Rub Down,Joe Tex,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7998,"
Because the jokes and grooves are mostly baldies and retreads, there's an obvious alternative title: Let Down. But that's only in comparison to Bumps and Bruises, the fruit of a layoff long enough to give this glorious bullshit artist the chance to think up some really good cons.

FALSE,B-,Midnight Mission,The Textones,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8483,"
I've tried to work up some enthusiasm for this well-meaning, well-reviewed quintet. I've tried to hear the commitment and imagination I know it took for a woman from Texas to infuse the tiredest straight-ahead rock with politics and personality. But except for ""Clean Cut Kid""--written by the new Dylan, sounds like the old Stones--what I mostly hear is committed straight-ahead rock that's tired by formal definition.

FALSE,B-,Them Crooked Vultures,Them Crooked Vultures,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15177,"
In his demure way, macho formalist Josh Homme has emerged as a post-Nirvana rock auteur to rival Jack White himself. Signature project taking a break? No prob. He'll just hire the supposed musical glue of the heaviest aggregation of all time, wave his magic bushwhacker and turn Nirvana's most successful member back into the drummer we wish he'd remained, and pound out what any blindfolded stoner with girlfriend problems would yell in your face was another Queens of the Stone Age album, and later for effing Eagles of Death Metal. Homme sees the humor in his formalism even if his fans don't, and the all-star rhythm section does add fluidity. But in the end this is hard-rawk nirvana with a small ""n""--a world of unusually hot sex and skull-busting drugs young guys with girlfriend problems will wish was so. I mean, that is one hell of a market share.

FALSE,B-,Lovelyville,Thinking Fellers Union Local #282,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3932,"
Although it's possible to imagine these musicians powering a rock and roll band that means a damn thing, this cross between Frisco antiheroes the Residents and Dixie dregs Love Tractor is too avant-garde to serve up anyone's money's worth. Nothing lasts, that's the message, whether it's the dense riffage of ""2X4S"" or the orchestrated guffaws and seal barks that finish ""More Glee"" with a flourish. Lyrics? How vulgar. We should be thankful when they make with the private jokes doted on by performance artists everywhere.

FALSE,B-,Jailbreak,Thin Lizzy,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7999,"
The proof of how desperate people are for new Springsteen is that they'll settle for this--even ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" is the sort of thing that ends up in Bruce's wastebasket. If Irish teen traumas are as boring as Phil Lynott's descriptions of them, it's no wonder they have trouble maintaining their birthrate. And if Irish teen traumas are as secondhand as Scott Gorham's guitar lines, the Irish will probably end up preferring Springsteen too.

FALSE,B-,Into the Gap,The Thompson Twins,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8496,"
No longer saddled with one of the most vacant art reputations in the history of hype, this decidedly unavant unfunk trio are free to pursue the airhead pop they were born to, and first try they've scored a natural: ""Hold Me Now"" is a classic on chord changes alone, i.e., even though Tom Bailey sings it. Nothing else here approaches its heart-tugging mastery, but the album remains lightly creditable through the title-cut chinoiserie which opens side two. After that, as Alannah Currie herself puts it, who can stop the rain?

FALSE,B-,Bad to the Bone,George Thorogood and the Destroyers,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8499,"
Thorogood has added true boogie power to his blues, so his Diddley and Hooker no longer sound like three-quarter-size juke-joint facsimiles. And in a predictable trade-off, he's added true boogie macho to his persona, so he gets his rocks off complaining about the Mann Act.

FALSE,B-,Most Known Unknown,Three 6 Mafia,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13103,"
The pull of their gut-rumbling brew of dark keyb riffs and viscous rhythm under unison vocals isn't absolute, but it's there, distinct and original. Unfortunately for connoisseurs of the saturnine, however, it comes with rhymes that are part of the aesthetic experience. As a putative cocaine magnate, rival flava-of-the-year proprietor Young Jeezy enjoys privileges that include triumphalist fanfares, yes-man cheering sections, and a relatively abstract level of brutality. These Memphis lifers sell ""street,"" eventuating in quite a bit of put-your-foot-up-they-ass, knock-the-black-off-your-ass, ransack-your-home, and rape-your-bitch-cause-she's-stacked. It isn't original to point out that the reality this worldview represents is a bully's reality, one that most of those who are stuck with it scheme to avoid. But originality isn't everything. Bully reality can be musically compelling, no question. But jones for it and you risk brutalizing yourself.

In the great tradition of Kansas and Starcastle (and also, let's be real, Berlin and Scandal), these social climbers infuse a Brit idea of dubious truth value with a shot of marketable American vulgarity--not only do they roll out synth-pop hooks like vintage A Flock of Seagulls, but Aimee Mann's throaty warble sounds almost human. And while the generalization level of her aggressively banal lyrics signals product, not expression, every one lands square on a recognizable romantic clichï¿½ï"

Tims' guitar, uncommonly lyrical in a style where chop and slash has become a convention makes the funk-here-ska-there modality-somewhere else excursions seem comfortable enough. But not only can't he sing, he can barely chant, and the dull sound that plagues ROIR tapes deadens any compensatory bass-and-drums thrust.

FALSE,B-,Tin Machine,Tin Machine,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6210,"
The hard-rock version of Let's Dance: in his corporate, iconic way, D. Bowie is sincerely trying to impress consumers. Before it's too late. Guitars range from imitation Thurston Moore to imitation Frank Marino, songs are as pissed off as a millionaire can be. But he isn't the supersponge he used to be, and as he already knew in 1983, the inescapable groove lends itself to skillful manufacture more readily than the righteous onslaught.

Obviously not stupid, which I can understand means a lot to them after their troubled childhoods, these guys are the class of the American post-rock cough cough hack hack movement ptooey ptooey. But I would direct their attention to the British band Mark-Almond, a now forgotten jamming unit that achieved real sales and a measure of hip around the time they were born. Not that I necessarily think these ""eclectic,"" consciously unspacy, all too unhurried soundscape improvisations are destined for the same degree of obscurity. Patterns of culture have changed, and in a boutique economy, this shit, like all other shit, is probably here to stay. Still, there are surer roads to posterity. Best moment: the lead bassline, lifted directly from ""Poptones"" (by PiL, kids).
"
FALSE,B-,Toto IV,Toto,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8515,"
Wish I could claim this millionaire Grammy-rock was totally pleasureless, but professionalism is rarely that neat. The fattest of all studio bands is almost as hooky as Shoes or the Ramones, and their production excesses at times betray verve, delight, even (though I must be mistaken) a sense of humor. But the lyrics are utterly forgettable, and the tone and spirit have nothing to do with rock and roll--unlike Thom Bell, to whom they've been rapturously compared in Billboard, they don't know the difference between slick and smooth, between hedonism and conspicuous consumption. At least Michael McDonald learned his shit from the real thing; Bobby Kimball and Steve Lukather learned theirs from McDonald. Still, for a band that crosses Chicago, Asia, and the Doobie Brothers, they have their glitzy moments.

Toussaint's vocals have gained confidence in a soft-sung kind of way, but I really like only two songs here, one of which has been done better by Bonnie Raitt and the other of which is called--I hesitate even to type it--""Basic Lady.""

FALSE,B-,Empty Glass,Peter Townshend,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8518,"
Townshend has said the only reason this isn't a Who record is that it wasn't time for a Who record, which must be his oblique way of apologizing for not being able to sing like Roger Daltrey. On his earlier solo excursions, the casually reflective mood suited his light timbre. Here he's coming to terms with love, frustration, punk, and other subjects that overtax his capacity for urgency and anger (and understanding). Who fans find the gap between aspiration and achievement touching, even thematic. Nonbelievers find it whiny. And they hate those ostinatos.

Lax at times, but not bad for live jazziness--Stevie Winwood and Dave Mason play as engagingly as Mike Ratledge and Elton Dean, say, and in a genuine rock style. Praise the masses it's a lot more aggressive than their studio work, with the double percussion of Jim Gordon and Rebop Kwaku Baah driving pretty hard at times. Even the lackadaisical ""Gimme Some Lovin'"" doesn't seem like a desecration.

Those who mourn the industrial-strength Pere Ubu find understandable solace in this harsh, hard-driven one-off featuring former Ubu guitarist Tom Herman. But it gets across mainly on its rough-cut spirit, and it could use a convincing front man, something the simpiest Ubu has never lacked.

In which a noisy rather than grungy garage band works to resolve its attraction-repulsion to pop--in the direction of something like ugly pop, maybe they think. They probably also think it's better, and technically they're right. But as their intentions and ideas become clearer, one realizes that it was unresolved attraction-repulsion as much as their surprising pop gifts that rescued them from the garage.

Like most of the backup soul sisters making solo moves these days--I count at least six on my review shelf right now--she could be any of the others, but she's got some extra savvy. The production picks and chooses, melding straight blues and gospel with its soul tricks. Troy shares songwriting with names like Harrison, Starkey, and Stills--whose ""Special Care"" is the only song here that sounds as fresh as the ASCAP oldie ""Exactly Like You.""

FALSE,B-,House of Music,T.S. Monk,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8534,"
Sandy Linzer's Chic move in the sense that Odyssey was his Dr. Buzzard move, with Thelonious Jr. playing drums and sister Boo Boo singing. But the world-historic irresistibility of the band's counterpart to the urbane ""Native New Yorker""--the c'est-si ""Bon Bon Vie,"" a rich song about aspiring to the rich life that's ebullient on top and this far from desperation underneath--inheres as much in Thelonious Jr.'s unslick, high-humored vocal and explosive percussion as in an arrangement that keeps revealing new pleasures. Maybe next time Linzer will produce a follow-up. This time you might consider purchasing a single worth the price of an LP.

FALSE,B-,The Tubes,The Tubes,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8033,"
If Blue Oyster Cult is hard-rock comedy, as I once claimed, then this is heavy-metal hysteria--without Buck Dharma, which is one of the jokes. So ugly it may be an earmark. So ugly it may be the American version of Genesis.

Since it's my instinct to detest this group, I was dismayed to catch myself chuckling at ""Tubes World Tour,"" ""Slipped My Disco,"" and even ""Proud to Be an American."" I was even more astonished to conclude that ""Pimp"" might be serious. Further investigation turned up no additional satisfactions, but revealed a movement away from Al Kooper's general parody of the hard and the heavy toward a more eclectic satirical style reminiscent of (they should be so funny) Stan Freberg.

If you think the inflatable dolls they sell with the Orgy-Gell in the back of cheap skin mags are sexy, then you will doubtless find this fifteen-year-old wonder of nature the hottest thing since that waitress who brought you the screwdrivers the time you blew $220 playing blackjack in downtown Winnemucca. A cute little ass, better-than-average pipes, and Billy Sherrill's usual ""who gives a shit if the title cut is commercial"" country album. Up a notch for no strings.

Amazingly, the title is pretty accurate--some of it's even twelve-bar. He's always played a mean, flashy guitar, and his deadpan is good for one moderately interesting LP. On the other hand, you should hear James Brown--or the Five Royales--sing ""Think.""

Crossing Josephine Baker and Grace Jones in a magisterially self-possessed style of ""blackness,"" Tina's a full-fledged superstar in Europe. In the U.S. she's more like Ray Charles or Tony Bennett--her iconic clout is heaviest when she's selling products other than her own expertly sultry recordings. And since chances are Plymouths make her just as hot as romantic sensuality, maybe this is as it should be.

Punk has not been good for former Duck Deluxe Sean T. because it's meant urbanization. I have nothing against the slick, hooky power chords his pub-rock has evolved into, not in theory. But when his charming if overly mythic tales of fireballs and West Texas running boards evolve into ""The Young Lords"" (give me a break, Bruce Springsteen) and ""On the Street"" (give me a break, Bob Geldof), I begin to crave recognizable human detail.

FALSE,B-,America -- Do You Remember the Love?,James Blood Ulmer,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1632,"
One danger of putting Bill Laswell in the studio with the likes of Blood is his respect for the avant-garde. From Nona Hendryx or Motorhead or even Sly and Robbie he'll brook no bullshit, but give him a committed innovator and he can turn into a humble servant of the muse, as in his worthy, inconsequential Celluloid LPs for Daniel Ponce, Billy Bang, etc. From Sonny Sharrock he got a definitive record that way; from Blood he gets a dud. The digital neatness may be Blue Note's fault, and the schematic instrumentals typify Laswell's compulsion to contain chaos. But the thinness of the guitar itself sounds like Blood's misplaced idea of a Wes Montgomery move. And I guarantee you Laswell didn't think any of the three vocal tracks were radio fare, no matter who he hired to sing backup.

FALSE,B-,October,U2,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4060,"
As they push past twenty their ambitions are showing, and suddenly the hope-addicts whiff both commerce and pretension. Sure it's still all fresh-faced and puissant in that vaguely political way that so moves the concerned rock journalist (and fan)--just not altogether unspoiled, sniff sniff. Bono Vox gets poetic, Steve Lillywhite gets arty, and those of us who expect more than sonic essence of rock and roll get enough melody and construction to make the first side a bit of all right. What a stupid band to expect purity from.
"
FALSE,B-,Zooropa,U2,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4066,"
I've never seen the point of hating U2. Their sound was their own from the git, and for a very famous person, Bono has always seemed thoughtful and good-hearted. I liked what I read about their pop irony, too. Problem was, I couldn't hear it--after many, many tries, Achtung Baby still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, and I put it in the hall unable to describe a single song. But having processed this blatant cool move, I'm ready to wax theoretical. Achtung Baby was produced by Daniel Lanois, and Daniel Lanois isn't Brian Eno--he's Eno's pet romantic, too soft to undercut U2's grandiosity, although I admittedly enjoy a few of its anthems-in-disguise now. Zooropa, on the other hand, is half an Eno album the way Low and ""Heroes"" were. The difference is that Bowie and Eno were fresher in 1977 than Bono and Eno are today. Each must have hoped that the other's strength would patch over his own weakness--that Eno's oft-wearisome affectlessness would be mitigated by Bono's oft-wearisome expressionism and vice versa. But tics ain't strengths, and although these pomo paradoxes have their moments, when I'm feeling snippy the whole project seems a disastrously affected pastiche of relinquished principle.

FALSE,B-,Fair Warning,Van Halen,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8560,"
Pretty impressive show-off stuff--not just Eddie's latest sound effects, but a few good jokes along with the mean ones and a rhythm section that can handle punk speed emotionally and technically. At times Eddie could even be said to play an expressive--lyrical?--role. Of course, what he's expressing is hard to say. Technocracy putting a patina on cynicism, a critic might say.

FALSE,B-,Diver Down,Van Halen,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8561,"
Less impressive, if only because hangloose covers like ""Big Bad Bill"" and ""Happy Trails"" are for more attractive bands. More attractive, if only because the Ray Davies and Roy Orbison covers are so carefully conceived. Attractive sexist original, unatttractive (hence unimpressive) sexist original, guitar as cathedral organ. And so it goes.

FALSE,B-,Suzanne Vega,Suzanne Vega,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8569,"
If I walked into a folk club and came upon this woman strumming her songs, I'd be impressed too--she picks her words with evident care and conversationalizes her chosen vocal tradition with evident savvy. But that's not good enough: great lyricists either dazzle you utterly or sneak the imagery on by, and no folk-based vocal tradition ought to require conversationalizing. Despite her considerable talent, Vega is self-consciously Artistic like so many folkies before her, which means that while a rock and roll production might power her over her affectations, more likely it just wouldn't mesh--the slightly prissy precision of these arrangements is precisely what the songs demand. As for that ersatz medieval ballad (which ain't bad, actually)--it's no anomaly.
"

Right off she declares for the new realism: ""Oh mom/The dreams are not so bad/It's just that there's so much to do/And I'm tired of sleeping."" About time, too--only she can't take it. She's politically alienated and not too thrilled about that abortion. She throws up her hands at the future. She's decorous, tuneful, art-directed. And she gets her title, whatever it means, from the one called ""Book of Dreams.""

If this is all that remains of the legendary 1970 engagement, I'll take my memories. The (mono) sound isn't bad for a record mastered from a Brigid Polk cassette, but that's not to say it isn't bad, and though I'm not one to cavil about out-of-tune guitars, this time I notice. Notable performance: Lou Reed's cover of the Maureen Tucker classic ""Afterhours.""
"
FALSE,B-,Go West,Village People,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3900,"
At first I dismissed this as market fatigue--it's hard to act like you're still discovering your formula on your fourth album in twenty-one months. With no help from a peaked-sounding Victor Willis--shouters should avoid even the appearance of laryngitis--it came off as a tuneless disco tribute to John Philip Sousa that omitted the ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" cover only because Jacques Morali doesn't control Sousa's publishing. But now I kind of enjoy it. Cruisin' was dumb, and this is an advance--a quantum leap in dumbness, without even risque puns to distract from Victor's metronomic cries. Although I have my doubts about this ""skin-diving"" stuff myself.

Vincent was never a titan--his few moments of rockabilly greatness were hyped-up distillations of slavering lust from a sensitive little guy who was just as comfortable with ""Over the Rainbow"" in his normal frame of mind. And despite what the '50s revivalists believe, this comeback is a return to form only in the formal sense--simple songs, Tex-Mex backing. Some of it's very sweet--Doug Sahm meets ""Over the Rainbow."" But even when he slavers he does so quietly.

Wainwright writes with more precision and imagination than any other singer-songwriter of the current boom, and his melodies stick with you. He sings and plays with such authority that even though this record features only voice and acoustic guitar it's powerful musically. But. The failures of the talented are always painful, and this is very strained. He's smart enough to integrate syntactical contortions into his style, and to match them vocally, but they still make you wince sometimes. And there's no emotional maturity to go with the verbal control, no sense of kindness or ease. I enjoy this record quite a bit, but I admire it more, and sometimes I don't like it at all.

Female chauvinism and a young lifetime's worth of melodies drew me to Waldman's reflections on trains, pirates, horses, show business, and of course love. Then Carola pointed out that this was the kind of woman who not only pronounces Mexico Mehico--as in ""Gringo en Mexico""--but who flings back her right arm and says ""Ole!"" as she does so. One reason I married Carola is that she's not much interested in trains, pirates, or horses. Show business and love are universals.

FALSE,B-,Greatest Hits,Jerry Jeff Walker,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8593,"
After running his best-of against his live double one-on-one, I can only conclude that this longtime folkie and frequent drunk, a native New Yorker upstate division, turned himself into the archetypal Sun Belt hippie the natural way: interacting nice and easy with the lost gonzos in his band and the refugees from reality in his cult or audience or whatever. Cult, I guess. His audience comprises the far-flung ""outlaw"" fans who made small-scale country ""hits"" of a few of his singles--only one of which, the live ""Mr. Bojangles,"" is even included here. Such interactions don't normally come through on plastic, especially in a factory-tooled genre like country music. This time, though, buy the live double.
"
FALSE,B-,Song for Patty,Sammy Walker,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8083,"
Walker's amazing early Dylan soundalike isn't an imitation, it's a charming tribute, and the highly recommended title cut exemplifies his (by now) all but unique fusion of novelistic eye and political heart. (Fusion, hell--I'll settle for either.) But he is a windbag, and no matter how hard he tries he's never funny.
"
FALSE,B-,Very Rare,T-Bone Walker,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8084,"
Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller put so much loving labor into this double-LP that it came out too tricky--the big band and the small band and the famous sidepeople and the new songs are all quite tasty, but they distract from what ought to be the business at hand. Of course, since T-Bone is singing more with his brain than his larynx these days, that may have been the idea. But I'd trade all the solos here except maybe Dizzy Gillespie's on ""Evening""--and there are lots of good ones--to hear T-Bone play guitar on every cut.
"
FALSE,B-,Breach,The Wallflowers,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3909,"
Don't envy Jakob Dylan his dilemma, but don't underestimate his privilege. He's no Julian Lennon, but he's also no Rufus Wainwright, and though he comes up with strong melodies, he's hardly a match for Ben Folds or Elliott Smith, both of whom frame their catchy stuff more idiosyncratically and neither of whom is terribly interesting even so. Dylan's lyrics competently explore the metaphor-laden broken-narrative mode his father invented and loosed on the world, just as his band concept does the flat-bottomed strophic folk-rock his father ditto. Nothing in his singing, his wordplay, or--a few lucky strikes aside--his tunecraft will tempt anyone who isn't stuck on his dad to parse those lyrics, to care what they mean. So he should praise the Lord for his cheekbones, which come from his mom.

FALSE,B-,The Best of Joe Walsh,Joe Walsh,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8086,"
'Twixt James Gang and Eagles Walsh justified his existence by developing his own brand of spacey, tuneful guitar schlock. I admit that it sounds like nothing else. But I can't imagine why anyone would want this much of it.

FALSE,B-,Why Can't We Be Friends?,War,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4134,"
I like the way ""Low Rider"" does its bit for fuel economy, but the rest of the good stuff disappoints: the title hit is greater on the radio, ""Heartbeat"" is greater by the Wild Magnolias, and the salsa section of ""Leroy's Lament"" gets lost on a record that's a laid-back revision of their basic shtick. They're better off heavy.
"
FALSE,B-,Famous Blue Raincoat,Jennifer Warnes,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8601,"
She's a background singer, a soundtrack diva, a Nashville-to-El-Lay pro. She loves Leonard Cohen's songs because she thinks they illuminate the dark side of the universe. Cohen thinks they are the universe. Which is why--Judy Collins be damned and Joe Cocker notwithstanding--they're all but inextricable from his tuneless, grave, infinitely self-mocking vocal presence.
"
FALSE,B-,Just Being Myself,Dionne Warwick,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8096,"
Even in the heyday of Bacharach-David Dionne didn't make such terrific albums--the best-ofs were the prizes. So Holland-Dozier-Holland are doing all right: solid pop, with the rhythm up front and the strings often used percussively--though they do wash out on ""I Always Get Caught in the Rain"" (inclement weather is as bad for arrangers as it is for lyricists). H ook-of-the-month: the guitar riff on ""You're Gonna Need Me.""
"
FALSE,B-,Mister Magic,Grover Washington Jr.,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1465,"
For the best-selling jazz album in the country, this is funktional enough. Washington plays a warm tenor in the pop jazz tradition of Gene Ammons, the rhythm section percolates danceably, and the result is sexy background music marred superficially by Bob James's strings.
"
FALSE,B-,Was (Not Was),Was (Not Was),1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4147,"
Brains galore, as both lyrics and horn charts trumpet. But if that ain't all, half the time it's too damn close--complementing the full complement of conceits is a grand total of three songs the way I count them. Which must make the omission of the rock-and-rolling ""Wheel Me Out,"" and for that matter A Christmas Record's ""Christmas Time in the Motor City,"" the kind of hubris the brainy can't resist.

FALSE,B-,Larger Than Life,Jody Watley,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6211,"
Having cornered a new-artist Grammy by narrowcasting her lust for lust, the young black-pop veteran comes up against the perils of upward mobility abuse--once you get hooked, you'll go to any length to keep rising to the top. Yet whatever she's like in ""real"" life, Jody's more credible servicing pop normals than disco nightcrawlers--demanding ""Real Love,"" hanging onto her ""L-O-V-E-R,"" dissing false ""Friends"" with a name rapper, etc. And for the first time, Andre Cymone's own grooves sound more original than his Prince imitations.

Okay, John, I understand how you go about things. A week or two in the studio with your guitar Freddie and your drummer Emry and a bunch of electric keyboards and organic percussion devices you can beat on yourself. Get rid of the horn guys, sure, you can do without 'em. Write the songs inside; keep them casual, funny, and of course funky. Ideal formula dance music, I agree--no frills. But even disco artists avoid the word ""disco"" in titles these days--sounds gauche. Also, why are you fading your voice back? So that no one notices you're singing about having money instead of not having it? And what happened to the hooks?

I used to be cowed by these guys, but all they are is Jeff Beck with liner notes. I mean, wouldn't you know that the finest fusion band in the land would be altogether too damn fine? Yoked to these tunes and concepts, their solidest rhythm section to date--Alphonso Johnson on bass and Ndugu on (trap) drums--only underscores their subservience to technique.

Down from 48 percent to 35 at amiannoying.com, not because they're less annoying but because they're less successful. Annoying they remain, and not, annoying webmaster, because they gigged as Goat Punishment or--who cares?--lost their bass player to the Rentals. They're annoying because Rivers Cuomo is the punk Tom Scholz--a solitary genius in love with big and precise. In Boston's arena-rock, this made sense even though it was annoying. In Weezer's arena-punk (slightly more arena on this outing, and less annoying as a result), it totally misses the point, which from the Ramones to the Libertines has been to achieve concision and economy while just barely remaining erect. Onstage, that is. How Cuomo has comported himself in other areas of endeavor I haven't a clue.

FALSE,B-,Revival,Gillian Welch,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1404,"
Who cares if her polka-dot dress is a costume rather than a heritage? She's got as much right to be a folkie as 10,000 mediocrities and a few dozen geniuses before her. Iris DeMent is a custodian's daughter, Lucinda Williams a poet's daughter, Bonnie Raitt a musical comedy star's daughter, yet from their differing authenticities each has said something unique about the rural South and everyday people. Welch is a songwriting team's daughter who, as is more common, hasn't--not yet, probably not ever. She just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off. Unless you're highly susceptible to good intentions, a malady some refer to as folkie's disease, that should be that.

FALSE,B-,Wet Willie's Greatest Hits,Wet Willie,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8108,"
Alone among Southern boogiemen, the Willies have avoided country as in c&amp;w for country as in funk, and their rhythm section gets away with it--drummer Lewis Ross and bass player Jack Hall are all juke-joint bump-and-grind. In a better world they'd be rednecks in a soul band, but as it is they're stuck in a group with two problems--singer and songs. (Oops, forgot the guitarist, which isn't hard.) Jimmy Hall supposedly combines Ronnie Van Zant's discretion with Gregg Allman's power, but to me he sounds like a cross between Chris Youlden and Lonesome Dave Peverett--with an authentic accent, of course. And although their one lucky strike has been the reggaeish ""Keep On Smilin',"" most of the time they strive fruitlessly for r&amp;b tunes as inescapably elementary as the here-included ""Shout Bamalama"" and ""Grits Ain't Groceries."" I guarantee you that Little Milton isn't going to return the favor and cover ""Leona"" or even ""Baby Fat."" But maybe Stoney Edwards would do ""Airport.""

FALSE,B-,Whodini,Whodini,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8617,"
With the secret of the great rap album still shrouded in mystery, you can't fault this attempt for starting with two intelligent if corny black youths from Brooklyn (cf. Wham! U.K.). But novelty hits do sometimes wear thin (cf. ""The Haunted House of Rock: Vocoder Version""). And though you might get away with producing your album in London or even Cologne, going from one to the other is asking for trouble.

"
FALSE,B-,A Ghost Is Born,Wilco,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12434,"
Not counting the 11-minute synth drone that Jeff Tweedy says reminds him of his migraines, the most blatant of the mannerisms that riddle this privileged self-indulgence is its dynamic strategy. Play the soft parts loud enough to hear and the loud parts will demonstrate the limitations of your cheapjack sound system, you pathetic transistorized consumer clone. Fortunately, there is a counterstrategy. Play the soft parts as faintly as they deserve and you'll still be able to make out the guitar workouts that are the only conceivable attraction the album will hold for any neutral party not seeking an associate degree in sound engineering. Once Tweedy wrote legible songs. They didn't add up to much because he didn't, but they had their shallow charms. Here he's beyond such compromises. ""Handshake Drugs"" we get, and the NPR-ready one about the best songs not getting on the radio is a clever feint. But it's hard to imagine any of the suckers who fell for the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot hype striving to identify with, say, ""Muzzle of Bees."" Not impossible. Just hard.

Does a fellow as bright and successful as this pudgy eccentric, who once boasted that he looked like a gym teacher from Bryn Mawr, have a right to revel in sentimentality? Maybe. Because unlike the people who make hit singles out of his songs (the Carpenters, Three Dog Night, etc.) he makes it sound as if reveling is fun.
"
FALSE,B-,The Joy of Flying,Tony Williams,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8127,"
For months I've had the nagging suspicion that this special-guests showcase might be that oddity of oddities, a good fusion album. But it's only an interesting one, featuring a duet with Cecil Taylor that has nothing to do with fusion and including among its snappy complexities a snappy tune that is actually fun--the lead cut, Jan Hammer's ""Going Far."" Rest assured that Hammer redeems himself tout de suite on George Benson's ""Hip Skip,"" which like most of what remains is snappy and complex and cloyingly high-tech in the great fusion tradition. But Ronnie Montrose's arena fusillades--unlike Benson's articulate tripe--are also fun. And not only is Williams equally comfortable with Cecil and snappy and heavy metal, he's worth listening to no matter what's in the foreground.
"
FALSE,B-,Brian Wilson,Brian Wilson,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6256,"
What made Brian's utopian fantasy so believable was the guileless hypocrisy of the simpletons fate and family tied him to--his shy, sincere, goofy, subtly tortured lyrics took off from the cheerful hedonism of the Beach Boys' secular chorales and white-boy soul. Solo, the pain in his voice is all too unmediated, and he isn't deep enough to make something of it--he sounds like the sincere, talented, mildly pretentious nut he is. What's more, his multiproduced million-dollar return is weighed down by a collective Phil Spector obsession--comes off incredibly labored. Of course, Smile was probably kind of overwrought too.
"
FALSE,B-,New Moon Daughter,Cassandra Wilson,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=552,"
Compelled to pretend they're superior to the pop text as well as the pop tune, encouraged to express rather than interpret but forbidden to ignore the words, too many jazz singers have trouble figuring out what to make of their material. And however admirable Wilson's independence of so-called classic pop, most of these songs escape her attentions without a mark on them. Which isn't to mention the ""Strange Fruit"" that establishes the surpassing weirdness of Billie's original, or the disastrous Monkees cover, designed to prove she has a sense of humor I'm now convinced isn't there.
"
FALSE,B-,"Third Down, 110 to Go",Jesse Winchester,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8130,"
Winchester's first LP was apolitical on the surface and not without its conservative tendencies, but its brooding lyricism and barely contained ferment reflected the force of will it took for him to flee this country. Here the frustrations of exile seem to have gotten to him--he sounds involuted, willfully slight. The title is a football fan's version of ""(Stuck Inside of Montreal with the) Memphis Blues Again,"" and even more telling is the way he feels about fatherhood: ""I can't get out of that.""
"
FALSE,B-,Learn to Love It,Jesse Winchester,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8131,"
Jesse sounds well. His singing has taken on character and humor and the new songs are pretty good. Yet there's something depressing about his resigned good cheer. Can domesticity be this disappointing--even domesticity confined within a draft resister's Canada? Only if you believe to your Mississippi soul that you were born a rambling man.
"
FALSE,B-,Talk Memphis,Jesse Winchester,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8634,"
For some reason I'd hoped that Jesse's meet-up with Willie Mitchell would inspire both of them to get funky--so much so that at first I mistook tuneful for a substitute. Then I recalled that these days tuneful demifunk is a working definition of pop. And realized that this isn't all that tuneful.
"
FALSE,B-,Wings at the Speed of Sound,Wings,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8137,"
The only substantial talent in this group is bassist-producer Paul McCartney, and he's at full strength only on the impassioned ""Beware My Love,"" although ""Let 'Em In"" and ""Silly Love Songs"" are charming if lightweight singles, and ""She's My Baby"" sounds like an outtake from the ""white"" double-LP by McCartney's former group, the Beatles. In any case, the supporting cast is disgracefully third-rate. The vocals of guitarist Denny Laine are even lamer than those of McCartney's wife and keyboard player, Linda.
"
FALSE,B-,Live,Johnny Winter,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8146,"
Except for the eight-minute ""Mean Town Blues,"" which damn near transforms John Lee Hooker's shuffle into a stumble, this is what every live album ought to be and all too few are: loud, fast, raucous, and to the point. But except for an intense ""Good Morning Little School Girl"" it doesn't get any encores.
"
FALSE,B-,"White, Hot and Blue",Johnny Winter,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8150,"
He was lionized as an authentic bluesman when Rolling Stone discovered him in 1968, and that's how he ended up--only a racist would deny his feeling for this music. Feel is something else. When he's entertaining, he's derivative; when he's original, he sounds shrill.
"
FALSE,B-,Raisin' Cain,Johnny Winter,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8638,"
Up against the Blues Brothers soundtrack (a cousin, like it or not), the vocal gifts of this flashy white blues freak turned steadfast white r&amp;b pro come clear--that drawling, high-pitched growl is his alone, and it's bluesier than Jake and Elwood for sure. On the other hand, Muddy Waters and Bobby Bland cut him. Unlike Jake or (especially) Elwood, and also unlike Muddy or Bobby, he doesn't seem to have a sense of humor. And he'll sing his bass player's songs.
"
FALSE,B-,Arc of a Diver,Steve Winwood,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8639,"
Winwood hasn't been a song artist since Dave Mason left Traffic, but at least here he takes responsibility for his own atmospherics. Instead of consorting with Ijahman or Stomu Yamashta, he's laid down this lulling British-international groove all by himself. Overdubbing, the technique is called. Very up-to-date.
"
FALSE,B-,Roll With It,Steve Winwood,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6233,"
Wish I could claim the music's sapped by whatever moves him to submit material to his beer company before his record company even hears it, but that happened long ago. If anything, this is an improvement--his contempo soul has gained not only bite but speed, so you have less time to think about it. Give most of these meaningless songs to some open-throated journeyman white people have never heard of--Bert Robinson, say, any big-voiced belter who doesn't conflate strain and feeling--and they might even sound like Saturday night.
"
FALSE,B-,The Ideal Copy,Wire,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4196,"
The Wire of punk myth abraded like the smell of gunpowder, fucking in the sand, a scouring pad. This is more like digital sound turned up too loud, a cold shower, a dash of after-shave: chronic alienation converted into quality entertainment. Except on a terrible track that outdoes slow Roxy Music, it's pretty bracing in both rock and disco modes. It's also nothing more.

FALSE,B-,It's Beginning To and Back Again,Wire,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6236,"
In an arty variation on the remix best-ofs that pass for new dance product these days, they recorded some concerts and reworked them in the studio and then reworked that. I don't know whether the new versions are better art than the old ones. But formalists rarely can tell the difference between progress and attenuation. And as the ear candy once-removed that is Wire's current calling, this wanders.

Wolf's propensity to rev into high gear has always been his undoing. Only when he lightens up can he uncover what little nuance he has at his disposal. His solo debut was coproduced by space monkey Michael Jonzun. It was playful. This one's coproduced by his engineer. It's mechanical.

FALSE,B-,Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants,Stevie Wonder,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3357,"
Like most great popular composers, Wonder is an appalling ""serious"" one. With their one-world instrumental flourishes and other sound effects, the presumably synthesized ""orchestral"" passages that dominate the first two sides are like bad (!) David Amram at their best (!) and some justifiably anonymous Hollywood hack at their worst. (Major exception: ""Race Babbling,"" especially when it glances a presumably synthesized horn riff off presumably synthesized voices and ostinatos.) And only two of the four songs on side three, which defenders of this album admire, are worthy of Key of Life. But on side four Wonder's indomitable open-heartedness finally breaks through the mawk. ""A Seed's a Star and Tree Medley"" is even more foolish philosophically than most of the rest of the album, but its elan makes Stevie's vitalism palpable, so that even the presumably synthesized orchestral passages that wrap things up sound ardently schmaltzy instead of depressingly schlocky. Still, next time I hope he aims lower.
"
FALSE,B-,Gimme Some Neck,Ron Wood,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8165,"
Ron sounds more Dylany on his new Dylan ditty than Dylan has in a while, and he sounds even better on a song about getting saved (which Dylan didn't write, praise the Lord). He's also induced Roy Thomas Baker to let him and the boys off with a mix as dirty as their rock and roll. But this is a man who should never sing two songs in a row. And he should stay away from lyrics about the perfidy of woman, too.

Catchy though it is--and why shouldn't it be, with Wood appropriating hooks if not entire melodies from the likes of Del Shannon, Elvis Presley, and ""Little Darlin'""?--this collection of iron pyrite oldies may be the most pointless English import since the bowler. On Boulders, Wood exploded the forms he exploited. Here he falls victim to the Grease syndrome--in playing tribute to the teen emotions that fueled rock and roll he comes dangerously close to condescension.

Set your political statements to unprepossessingly hypnotic music and you'd better be sure your politics are spot on--astute, clear, epigrammatic, correct. Don't deploy a slur like ""aryan"" anachronistically or attribute a phrase of Harold Rosenberg's to Noam Chomsky. Don't insult the genocide in East Timor with minimalist obscurantism. Don't preach to the converted until you've made more converts.

FALSE,B-,Anniversary: Twenty Years of Hits,Tammy Wynette,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3410,"
Her corn pone all husk, her bouffant as sultry as Aretha's do, she sings like the heartbreaker who's about to best the long-suffering wife her lyrics put on a pedestal, but no matter how hypocritical her trademark equation between marriage, submission, and fulfillment, she remains the most soulful female country singer ever. And since she left George Jones (which no one in the world blames her for) and found fulfillment with George Richey a decade ago, her music has gone phfft. Twenty years my foot--the newest song here is a (professional) reunion with George (Jones) that's seven years old. In a world where Greatest Hits, Greatest Hits Volume 4, and George &amp; Tammy's Greatest Hits still exist, this unexceptionable CD-length commemorative issue is about as useful as a kudzu seed. Consult your catalogue.

Stripped of the vicious tensions that made them great--between good and evil, John and Exene, Billy Zoom and Skunk Baxter--they return as the reason young bohos are afraid to grow up. This isn't folk-rock in disguise; Tony Gilkyson's hooks evoke a machine shop, not a barn raising. But they leave going 120 to a bad old black-and-white--even with their seat belts on, the kids in the back would get hurt real bad in a crash. And save hostility for the warmongers--ensconced in separate but functional marriages, John and Exene have nothing to fight about anymore. Which in the usual tragic contradiction leaves the emotion so abstract that the songs are tough to grab hold of. Only the spiteful putdowns--Exene's ""Everybody,"" John's ""Baby You Lied""--sound like old times. Not to mention new ones.

Last time they were calling it white music, this time they've released a dub version, and what can you call that except au courant? Or here's another one. It's Andy Partridge who puts the pop in their art-pop, right? If you can tell me whether his ""Mecanik Dancing"" is pro or con, I'll prove to you that his ""Life Is Good in the Greenhouse"" means it.
"
FALSE,B-,Mummer,XTC,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8661,"
Having retired full-time to the studio, the definitive English art-poppers sound more mannered and arid than ever, which is no less bothersome just because it's one way they have of telling us something. By now, there are hints of guilt-tripping in Andy Partridge's awareness of what he isn't, and while ""Human Alchemy"" (""To turn their skins of black into the skins/Of brightest gold"") and ""Funk Pop a Roll"" (""But please don't listen to me/I've already been poisoned by this industry"") are notably mordant takes on two essential rock and roll subjects, Partridge deliberately limits their reach. The eccentric dissonances that sour his melodies and the fitful time shifts that undercut his groove may well bespeak his own sense of distance, but art-poppers who command both melody and groove are rare enough that I wish he'd find another way.

Compulsive formalists can't fabricate meaning--by which I mean nothing deeper than extrinsic interest--without a frame (cf. Skylarking, even the Dukes of Stratosfear). The only concept discernible on this hour-long double-LP is CD. Def Leppard got there first.

FALSE,B-,Yachts,Yachts,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8181,"
You have to hand it to a group that can give itself such a ridiculous name and then come up with credible songs called ""Yachting Type"" and ""Semaphore Love."" Actually, most of these songs are pretty credible, even (or especially) the one structured around the word ""tantamount."" Funny boys, no doubt about it. But their biggest joke is a mock-snooty, mock-operatic rock crooning style that I'm not eager to hear again.

FALSE,B-,The Yes Album,Yes,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4238,"
Jon Anderson, who delivers the inane Con III lyrics with prissy expertise, and Tony Kaye, whose keyboards run the gamut from vague to overweening, are the bad guys. Bill Bruford, who rocks the rather fancy tempos and signatures, and Chris Squire, best when he gets a good interlock going with Bruford, are the neutrals. And new guitarist Steve Howe makes the record worth hearing if not owning. His commentary throughout ""Yours Is No Disgrace,"" his live acoustic solo ""The Clap,"" and his duet with himself on ""Wï¿½ï"" (that's German for ""worm,"" in case you're interested) make the first side almost interesting, and he's at the heart of the album's one great cut, ""I've Seen All Good People,"" where all their arty eclecticism comes together for 6:47.

FALSE,B-,Yipes!,Yipes!,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8185,"
This Wisconsin band is nowhere near as yucky as name and packaging suggest--how can you hate someone who complains that Californians ""got no ceilings on their cars""? Subjects of other cartoons--some simple-minded, some not--include class rivalry, being white, and the cold war. The problem is leader Pat McCurdy, who has one of those ""good rock voices"" that enable the artiste to shout in tune but don't permit much nuance. You can almost see him curling his lip and raising his eyebrows whenever a joke comes up. Oh well.

FALSE,B-,Hillbilly Deluxe,Dwight Yoakam,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8667,"
Buck Owens may be his hero, but if George Jones earns a ten for contained intensity and Ricky Skaggs a one, Owens gets an eight and Yoakam maybe a four--he never breaks out of the jams, fixes, and world-historical dilemmas that are country music's reason for being. Reminding us once again that in a genre that's always fetishized tradition, neotraditionalism means immersing yourself in limitation until you convince yourself it's the air you breathe.

FALSE,B-,The Eraser,Thom Yorke,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13560,"
I'd hoped that either I would learn to like this Thommy Boy excursus or the disaffected young professionals who hang on his every megrim would call an anxiety attack what it is. No such luck. Few believe Yorke's solo daybyew has the weight of a Radiohead album, that increasingly rare and invariably overrated thing. But such is the lure of his hypersensitivity that his admirers forgive and even applaud the extreme attenuation of this tastefully decorated click-and-loop. One rationalization is the lyrics, which state his overstated concerns in so many statements rather than camouflaging them in metaphor. And I admit it, the one about the rain is pretty good.

FALSE,B-,Musicforthemorningafter,Pete Yorn,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10331,"
The younger brother of a bigtimeentertainment lawyer and the hottest agent in Hollywood is as neotraditionalist as Gillian Welch, only his chosen tradition is the El Lay sound perfected by Peter Asher and Chuck Plotkin: kempt guitar hooks atop solid drum parts he lays down himself, with some Mitchell Froom-style studio murk for hipness and atmosphere. If you love rock and roll it'll make your skin crawl on contact. If you have a weakness for tune it'll grow on you. Only then, if you have any brains left, you'll wonder why you haven't connected with a single phrase and find more El Lay on the lyric sheet--a fusion of old-style singer-songwriter indirection and new-style song-doctor ur-banality. Honors the diction and cadences of ordinary speech, 'tis said--until there are scansion problems, when up pop anti-idioms like ""the look upon your face"" and ""you were never fond of anything I said."" You said it, buster.

FALSE,B-,This Note's for You,Neil Young & the Bluenotes,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5962,"
Those who detect surer songwriting and tougher guitar amid the eccentric horns are right, but the horns render such details irrelevant if not unlistenable--their sour blare mimics Young's crude guitar sound all too crudely, and the charts lack that spontaneous spark, as charts generally do. Grabber: solo blues, with solitary trumpet fluttering in the background.
"
FALSE,B-,Refreshments,Young Fresh Fellows,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8673,"
Outtakes and oddments from a too-silly-to-begin-with band who deserve credit for offering to rename ""Beer Money"" ""Pepsi-Cola Money"" if MJ's corporate sponsor will, well, bribe them. In the meantime: ""The beer is free and we're on MTV/And we're opening for the Del Fuegos.""
"
FALSE,B-,Total Control,Yo Yo,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4264,"
As distasteful as I find Lil' Kim, who conveys even less pleasure in sex than that tragic sensualist Eazy-E, and Foxy Brown, who isn't subtle enough to shroud her vicious fantasies in an aura of mystery, at least they break new ground in candor and aggression. And Yo Yo's East Coast counterpart Lyte has gained in wisdom and principle, while the self-appointed Intelligent Black Woman has gone soft. The beats are a case study in the banality of G-funk, and where once she was a proud, tough-minded observer, here her only winning moments come when she pledges allegiance to her ordinary G and fantasizes momentarily about having babies. These dreams die, she don't know why, and soon it ain't nuthin' but a party where she can find her dream guy--""nice and thick with more dollars than sense."" Hey, didn't she steal that line from Julie Brown or somebody? L.A., what a town.

FALSE,B-,Apostrophe ('),Frank Zappa,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8195,"
Disillusioned acolytes are complaining that he's retreated, which means he's finally made top ten, but that's just his reward for professional persistence. If anything, the satire's improved a little, and the title piece--an improvisation with Jack Bruce, Jim Gordon, and rhythm guitarist Tony Duran--forays into quartet-style jazz-rock. Given Frank's distaste for ""Cosmik Debris"" you'd think maybe he's come up with something earthier than Mahavishnu, but given his distaste for sex you can be sure it's more cerebral instead.
"
FALSE,B-,Sleep Dirt,Frank Zappa,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8199,"
For what it's worth, I thought I'd mention that this collection of outtakes showcases more good music than any Zappa album in years--including its companion piece, Studio Tan, which features a twenty-minute narrative called ""Greggery Peccary"" that could make me defend El Lay. Maybe the secret of Sleep Dirt is that Frank doesn't talk on it. But that didn't help Orchestral Favorites.
"
FALSE,B-,Translate Slowly,Zeitgeist,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8677,"
I don't want to alienate my target audience or anything, but I can't contain myself: from their offhandedly opalescent songpoetry to their hints of social commentary to their chiming pop polytechnique to their better-name-than-Angst-at-least-only-these-fools-try-and-live-up-to-it, this is one collegiate band. There's hope, though--if they get picked up by Elektra and break through on a fluke video, they may start writing about cocaine and Holiday Inns.
"
FALSE,B-,Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School,Warren Zevon,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4139,"
I don't know why the title tune's the title tune, except maybe to contextualize the classical interludes he composed all by himself, and Lord help us he's been hanging out with the Eagles, just like Randy Newman, who could teach him something about slandering the South--even Neil Young could do better than incest and Lynyrd Skynyrd, though the brucellosis is a nice touch. In fact, just about every song boasts a good line or three. But the only ones that score are the jokes: Ernie K-Doe's sly, shy ""A Certain Girl,"" and ""Gorilla, You're a Desperado,"" a satire of the Eagles, not to mention Warren Zevon. Don Henley sings harmony. Linda Ronstadt will not cover.
