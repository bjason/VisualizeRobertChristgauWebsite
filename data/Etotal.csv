FALSE,E+,Fandangos in Space,Carmen,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6545,"
A record so dreadful I listened to it all the way through just so I could note its passing, which I trust will be instantaneous. The worst of at least four modes: concept-rock, theater-rock, space-rock, and Anglo-Iberian, with a real live Spanish Person on castanets, vibes, and high heels. Ol�������"

This ought to be marked with a sic. They probably spell it humour, too, just like the phlegm in medieval medicine.

FALSE,E+,I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier,Eli Radish,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10845,"
The packaging implies that this indifferent collection of patriotic songs is an anti-war record. Maybe I'm missing something, but it can't be worth four bucks.

The plus is because the title lets everyone make up his or her own joke.

Rescued from my second-apartment second-listen pile by a reader's tentative C rating, this one is a caricature of the new releases that glut the stores, not to mention my workroom. Badly sung (ranging from pseudo-soul to imitation Happenings), full of pretentious production effects (another disaster from Dunwich Productions), its silly lyrics reproduced proudly within the double-fold--yet someone bought it and listened to it and I can almost understand. What a gap there is between people who pay for their records and those who hear everything free. As a final insult, group members are listed ""upper right,"" ""upper left,"" etc.

FALSE,E-,I'm Bad,Kim Fowley,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6848,"
I've nothing against hype, but it's a little low to distribute snazzy jackets containing blank discs. Caveat emptor.

FALSE,E,Twelve Original Recordings,Bow Wow Wow,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4445,"
Ever the creative marketer, Malcolm McLaren sticks the purportedly never-to-be-vinylized Your Cassette Pet together with almost everything else his latest victims recorded for EMI. Docked the max for lying.
"
FALSE,E,Vintage,Canned Heat,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11058,"
I don't care how much you like the group, this collection of three-year-old tapes, rechanneled for stereo and running all of 23.12 minutes (that's right, it's really an E plus) insults your income and your intelligence. Are there really white blues scholars who want to know what the Bear sounded like when he was pure? Ridiculous, and sad.
"
FALSE,E,Dylan,Bob Dylan,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6757,"
Listening to this set of rejects from what used to be Dylan's worst album does have its morbid fascination--if you'll forgive the esoteric reference, it's like watching Ryne Duren pitch without glasses. Not only are the timbre and melody off--he was always wild--but he also doesn't phrase cogently, and the songs just hit the dirt. All of which is CBS's punishment after Bobby had the bad manners to sign with another label. I wonder how he could imagine that Columbia is less than benevolent.
"
FALSE,E,Outrageous,Kim Fowley,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10838,"
Fowley is such a gargantuan shuck that he ought to be preserved in a time capsule. I don't understand how he continues to earn a living, but he does. This is a follow-up to his flower record of a couple of years ago. It comes complete with revolutionary liner notes (""Guerilla warfare has begun. The streets belong to the people. Let's tune in to find out what went wrong today."") that for some reason--they'd sell a few, no?--are concealed within the double-fold.
"
FALSE,E,G N' R Lies,Guns N' Roses,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4905,"
Axl's voice is a power tool with attachments, Slash's guitar a hype, the groove potent ""hard rock,"" and the songwriting not without its virtues. So figure musical quality at around C plus and take the grade as a call to boycott, a reminder to clean livers who yearn for the wild side that the necessary link between sex-and-drugs and rock-and-roll is a Hollywood fantasy. Anyway, this band isn't even sex and drugs--it's dicking her ass before you smack up with her hatpin. (No wonder they want to do an AIDS benefit.) ""One in a Million""--""Immigrants and faggots/They make no sense to me/They come to our country/And think they'll do as they please/Like start some mini-Iran/Or spread some fucking disease/They talk so many goddamn ways/It's all Greek to me""--is disgusting because it's heartfelt and disgusting again because it's a grandstand play. It gives away the ""joke"" (to quote the chickenshit ""apologies"" on the cover) about the offed girlfriend the way ""Turn around bitch I've got a use for you"" gives away ""Sweet Child o' Mine."" Back when they hit the racks, these posers talked a lot of guff about suicide. I'm still betting they don't have it in them to jump.

FALSE,E,What's Happening to Our World?,Kay Huntington,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7043,"
This is either a hilarious takeoff on circa-1964 folk music, complete with sensitive vibrato, hard little guitar parts, and very moderate good intentions, or--more likely, unlikely as it may seem--one of the most atrocious records ever made. Perfectly awful, right down to liner notes and cover portrait--Huntington, a dyed-looking Minnesotan blonde who appears very reluctant to celebrate birthdays, is wearing a red minidress. Noted primarily as a Remarkable Occurrence, which I trust someone at United Artists is already investigating. Pick: the apparently unsarcastic ""Right to Poverty.""
"
FALSE,E,Rock 'n' Soul,Jebadiah,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7105,"
At last, a record designed to end those party-pooping disputes over whether to dance to disco or the Stones. Yes, record-buyers, Michael Zager has discofied six Stones classics, and I beg him to check with Santa Esmeralda (or hire the Hollyridge Strings) before trying anything like it again. Advice to partygivers: settle those arguments with the ""Miss You"" disco disc. Personal to Ralph Abernathy: Boycott ""Brown Sugar.""
"
FALSE,E,The Pope Smokes Dope,David Peel and the Lower East Side,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5641,"
The hippie as hype strikes again. Not that Peel isn't a ""real"" hippie--on the contrary, he's a case study in the moral inadequacy of authenticity. He's real, yes--and he's also stupid and hypocritical. In 1969 Danny Fields, then ""house hippie"" at Elektra, got Peel's Have a Marijuana onto the charts; now John Lennon's doing the same thing for this tuneless doggerel. It's enough to make you miss the Maharishi.

"
FALSE,E,Rock & Roll Is Hear to Stay!,Sha Na Na,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10888,"
I am not an ecstatic fan of Sha Na Na's famous live act--I think it is a mistake to parody Elvis Presley, because he's too good, and that mistake throws the whole put-on into question--but at least it is spirited and funny. The record is dull. It is as if Enoch Light had recorded 14 of your favorite all-time rock and roll hits. Sometimes these songs were stupid, but they always had life. What can I say? Not only was Sonny James's version of ""Young Love"" better than Sha Na Na's--so was Tab Hunter's.

FALSE,E,Spilt Milk,Laurie Styvers,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7925,"
Normally, I ignore records as rightfully obscure as this one, but I thought it was time I mentioned that our hippest record company is getting more complacent all the time--just how many L.A. airheads can we stand? Styvers is the kind of person who makes me like junkies--you know, the baby you want to steal candy from, so trite and pretty-poo in her fashionably troubled adolescence that you hope she chokes on her own money. One line says it all: ""There just aren't words for the songs of the people who really feel."" Oh shut up, Laurie.

That's right, Elton John's lyricist--you think there were two of them? Reciting his verse to musical accompaniment, just like Rod McKuen. Who does it better.

FALSE,E,Wolfman Jack,Wolfman Jack,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10958,"
An out-and-out rip-off, which is fine--the Woofman has always been more extreme than human dee-jays--but still costs you money. Remember, the radio is free.
