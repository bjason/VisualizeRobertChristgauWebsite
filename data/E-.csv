Rescued from my second-apartment second-listen pile by a reader's tentative C rating, this one is a caricature of the new releases that glut the stores, not to mention my workroom. Badly sung (ranging from pseudo-soul to imitation Happenings), full of pretentious production effects (another disaster from Dunwich Productions), its silly lyrics reproduced proudly within the double-fold--yet someone bought it and listened to it and I can almost understand. What a gap there is between people who pay for their records and those who hear everything free. As a final insult, group members are listed ""upper right,"" ""upper left,"" etc.

I've nothing against hype, but it's a little low to distribute snazzy jackets containing blank discs. Caveat emptor.
