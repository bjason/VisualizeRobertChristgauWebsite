FALSE,D+,Whenever You Need Somebody,Rick Astley,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4339,"
Launching his career with seed money from Thatcher's Enterprise Allowance Scheme, Astley graduated from singer-bandleader to tape op and tea boy at Stock Aitken Waterman, where he ripened for a year before donning a full set of SAW hooks and emerging as beefcake juicier than Adam Faith, Marty Wilde, or Johnny Wadd ever dreamed. And that's according to the notes--it's the image he wants to project. Musically he's a throwback to such long-forgotten big-band singers manqu������������������ as Don Rondo, with more muscle and less sweetness or swing. Blame him on Northern Soul, its attraction to Afro-America finally reveale"
FALSE,D+,Second Wind,Brian Auger's Oblivion Express,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11421,"
Auger is a keyboard virtuoso and so what? Like most jazz-rock, this is a mishmash, not a synthesis, a loud version of the jazz of a decade ago. A voice is used not for human dimension, but for ""dynamics"" and the lyrics are so empty they might as well be Ray Conniff doodly-doodly-doo.
"
FALSE,D+,My Griffin Is Gone,Hoyt Axton,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10831,"
Hoyt Axton, who can't sing, has written two good songs, ""The Pusher"" and ""On the Natural."" The latter is on this record, produced by Alex Hassilev, who can't produce.

FALSE,D+,Ginger Baker's Air Force,Ginger Baker's Air Force,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6346,"
Contrary to rumor, Baker is not the best drummer in the world. Elvin Jones is. (Not to mention Keith Moon. Or Tony Williams. Or whoever's at the Village Vanguard this week.) And I wouldn't want to hear Elvin Jones's ten-piece horn band, either--good horn players lead their own bands, and bands led by drummers tend to leave a lot of space for drum solos. Plus this is a live double album and the sound is terrible. Plus I'm starting a rumor that Stevie Winwood is no longer the best Stevie Winwood in the world.

FALSE,D+,Bio,Chuck Berry,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6392,"
Willie Mays was the greatest baseball player who ever lived, but he just can't cut it anymore. He reminds me more of Chuck Berry every time out.
"
FALSE,D+,Midstream,Debby Boone,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6443,"
Does the title mean she'd rather drown than get hit by a truck in the MOR? Or that she's changing horses midrecord from Joe Brooks (get the pun?) to Brooks (get it now?) Arthur? Arthur's side offers classy material (this year Allee Willis, maybe next Janis Ian!), while Joe's is junk almost as jingly as ""You Light Up My Life."" I prefer Joe's. I'd also prefer to get hit by a truck.
"
FALSE,D+,Sun Baked Snow Cave,Boris With Merzbow,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13092,"
Only innocent doomsayers willing to call someone plucking a guitar every few seconds for 12 minutes a ""solo"" will get to minute 38, when Merzbow makes some interesting noises that in just a few precious moments decay, like everything in this universe of pain, boredom, and surplus value. But be of good cheer. For verily, if a band named after a Melvins song thinks the world is coming to an end, it almost certainly isn't.
"
FALSE,D+,Some Things Coming,Delaney Bramlett,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6454,"
Either he's mad with grief or he switched to Columbia so that James William Guercio could do his horn arrangements. Too bad he didn't get him.
"
FALSE,D+,Black Caesar,James Brown,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6469,"
You listen to Brown for music, not songs, but that's no reason to expect good soundtrack albums from him. He should never be allowed near a vibraphone again.
"
FALSE,D+,The Black Man's Burdon,Eric Burdon and War,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6509,"
On the front cover of this album is a black man in silhouette. On the back cover Eric, looking paunchy, rests his head in the crotch of a black woman straddled above him. He also holds her ankles. Inside the jacket seven men, presumably the band, occupy the background of a full-length photo of a grassy field. Six of the men are black; five are bare-chested. In the foreground recline two naked blondes who obviously belong in a centerfold. The left hand of one is thrown back to reveal a clean-shaven and possibly airbrushed underarm, so that her right does not quite conceal her pubic hair. Her companion hides her sex with both hands. The only man who is standing appears to be walking toward the women. He has removed the belt from his pants.
"
FALSE,D+,Short Stories,Harry Chapin,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6560,"
Harry had a problem. He wanted to write a song about a DJ, kind of a follow-up to ""Taxi,"" just to prove it wasn't a fluke. Harry doesn't meet many real people, so cabbies and DJs provide that touch of social realism. He wanted to set the song in Boise, Idaho, not because he had anything to say about Boise, but because ""Idaho"" rhymed with ""late night talk show."" Unfortunately, call letters that far west start with K rather than W, which messed up his rhythm. Akron, Ohio? Wrong rhythm again. Denver, Colorado? Nope. So he called it ""WOLD"" and hoped no one would notice. Note: this analysis is nowhere near as longwinded as Harry's stories.
"
FALSE,D+,Chicago,Chicago,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11074,"
Duke Ellington never got away with an extended work for horns and meaningfulness. What, then, makes James William Guercio and the self-designated revolutionaries who are his cohorts think they can? Sterile and stupid.

FALSE,D+,"I, Swinger",Combustible Edison,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8690,"
Finally, recorded evidence of the more-cited-than-sighted lounge-music wave, including Nino Rota cover, stereo panning, Canadian Club vocals, and of course a vibraphone. In today's anything-goes environment, they might conceivably make music hepper than Liz Phair's or Pearl Jam's and more enduring than Leon Redbone's or Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks', only they're not talented enough. ""Nothing coy here, no sly indie-rock wink, and never say `novelty.'"" Right.

FALSE,D+,Here We Go Again,Country Joe & the Fish,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10819,"
A sad ego trip.
"
FALSE,D+,Loose,Crazy Horse,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6644,"
Danny Whitten, Jack Nitzsche, and Nils Lofgren (remember those names) are replaced by George Whitsell, John Blanton, and Greg Leroy (forget those), leaving us (and them) with Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. I know rhythm sections are essential, but this lifeless country-rock should teach everybody how sufficient they are. The most disappointing follow-up in memory.

Wait a second--wasn't this a quartet?
"
FALSE,D+,Down at Rachel's Place,Mike d'Abo,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11423,"
Normally, I only play the first side of just plain dull records like this one, but because d'Abo wrote ""Handbags and Gladrags"" I not only played side two but played it twice. A waste of time.
"
FALSE,D+,Singer of Songs--Teller of Tales,Paul Davis,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6684,"
Local labels surely do a worthy work in this era of conglomerate rock. If it weren't for Atlanta-based Bang, Atlanta-based Davis might never have discovered that there's a modestly profitable audience for humorless singer-songwriters all across this land of ours.
"
FALSE,D+,John Denver's Greatest Hits Volume 2,John Denver,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6698,"
My God, he was right about cities after all--urban blights like television and Ticketron have turned this innocent folkie into the blandest pop singer in history. Only ""Annie's Song"" packs any of the old simple-minded charm, and four of these ten songs are devoid of any interest whatsoever--his folksy lies about country boys and feather beds are at least upbeat by comparison.
"
FALSE,D+,Hot August Night,Neil Diamond,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6708,"
From the first guitar riff of this profit-taking double live showcase, it's obvious that the man is some sort of genius rock entertainer, but for the most part the great entertainer is striving for bad art and not even achieving it. The humor here is almost as sententious as the phony canta libre and the country-western parodies might get a poorer, drunker man lynched.
"
FALSE,D+,The London Bo Diddley Sessions,Bo Diddley,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6716,"
This is the one the company will push, and it's his worst--give or take a joke or two, pro forma throughout. Hint: Bo's best-of is called Got My Own Bag of Tricks.
"
FALSE,D+,Celine Dion,Celine Dion,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=556,"
Montreal chanteuse goes gold Stateside, and I'm thinking, hey, North American Eurodisco for Anglophones, could be OK. Not hardly. Though the two Ric Wake productions lilt sweetly enough, she's a creature of the power ballad, with tympani all over her drum pads and Diane Warren hand-me-downs for hooks. Worst album of the year--that I can remember.
"
FALSE,D+,Sweet Linda Divine,Sweet Linda Divine,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10856,"
Linda Tillery is a somewhat excessive black girl with a razor in her larynx who did a pretty good record with the Loading Zone. Now Al Kooper, wearing his producer suit, has gotten hold of her and indulged her excesses as if they were his own. It was five years between ""Highway 61 Revisited"" and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."" Was it really worth the wait?
"
FALSE,D+,Pictures from an Exhibition,"Emerson, Lake & Palmer",1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6786,"
This cover version of Moussorgsky's mouldy oldie does have a big new beat, but you can't dance to it, and the instrumentation seems a bit spare. Anyway, the truth is that I don't even listen to the original much.
"
FALSE,D+,Watermark,Enya,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4736,"
A new name with a pedigree--she brought her family's upmarket Irish folk concept Clannad into the synthesizer age before leaving to pursue her own economic interests. Whilst humanizing technology, perpetrating banal verse in three languages (I'm guessing about the Gaelic after reading the English and figuring out the Latin), and mentioning Africa, the Orinoco, and other deep dark faraway places, her top-10 CD makes hay of pop's old reliable women-are-angels scam. At least the Cocteau Twins are eccentric. At least ELP were vulgarians.
"
FALSE,D+,Captive Angel,Dan Fogelberg,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6836,"
Such kind folks at Epic Records and Full Moon Productions--not only have they let Fogelberg record nine more songs, and taken down something he hummed in the rec room for Glen Spreen to orchestrate, but they've let him put some of his art therapy on the cover. Dimensionality is beyond him (or else he doesn't know much about breasts), and it does look as if somebody put out the angel's eyes with a poker, but after all, it's the spirit that counts.
"
FALSE,D+,Fotomaker,Fotomaker,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6845,"
In which the label that has already brought us Firefall, Festival, Foreigner, Funkpot, Fishwife, Failure, and Fuckall sponsors yet another dupergroup made up of yet another batch of craft-obsessed rock dues-payers. Unfortunately, this one is faceless even by low-profile dupergroup standards. (Say, there's a name for a band--Faceless.) After all, Firefall did blend second-line graduates of Spirit and the Flying Burrito Brothers into their distinctively unexciting rock country-pop. And Fuckall did fuse second-line graduates of Chelsea and the Harlots of 42nd Street into their harmlessly obscene rock punk-pop. But second-line graduates of the Rascals and the Raspberries make only for depressingly mediocre rock abcxyz-pop. This is formally appropriate--titles like ""Where Have You Been All My Life"" and ""Two Can Make It Work"" would be altogether overwhelmed by hooks, melodies, or singing of the slightest originality or enthusiasm. Beat the rush--boycott now, before anyone has even heard of them.
"
FALSE,D+,Fresh Out of Borstal,Fresh,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6871,"
This candidly Stonesish studio quasi-hype is dutifully class-conscious, but it bears about as much relation to the prison homosexuality alluded to in the ads as an aspirin dramatization does to open heart surgery. That is, lest my rhetoric confuse you: this is not a record about bugger-rape. Docked two notches for misrepresenting itself.
"
FALSE,D+,. . . And Then There Were Three . . .,Genesis,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6906,"
The departure of Peter Gabriel having long since left them a quartet, what might this title indicate? Ask ex-fan Jon Pareles: ""Without lead guitarist Steve Hackett, the band loses its last remaining focal point; the rest is double-tracking. Hence a sound as mushy as the dread Moody Blues, with fewer excuses.""
"
FALSE,D+,Motor-Cycle,Lotti Golden,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10860,"
I don't like this myself, but I also don't like Laura Nyro. If you do, you might glance at the lyrics on the back of the jacket and find out if you're interested.
"
FALSE,D+,Through the Fire,"Hagar, Schon, Aaronson, Shrieve",1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4908,"
I know, no point complaining about these grizzled dildos--it's only corporate metal. But shouldn't their merger at least produce a decent name for a law firm?
"
FALSE,D+,Greatest Hits Volume 2,Tom T. Hall,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6975,"
From the received novelty melodies of ""That Song Is Driving Me Crazy"" and ""I Like Beer"" to the prefab lyrics of ""Country Is"" and the odious ""I Love""--a list of things people get sentimental about! and the list gets them sentimental all over again!--this should convince any doubters in Nashville that T is just another professional manipulator, with all that liberal stuff just another marketing ploy. It damn near convinces me. And that's not even counting the two kiddie songs.
"
FALSE,D+,John Hartford,John Hartford,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10861,"
Hartford is an engaging singer and an excellent songwriter, but the production and arrangements on this record are criminal (boo Rock Jarrard! Boo Al Capps!) and the material very thin--nothing near the calibre of, say, ""California Earthquake."" Songs about warts take you just so far. Unipak.
"
FALSE,D+,I Love You,Eddie Holman,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11061,"
Some of this is almost palatable sweetie-pie crooning, the rest as bad as ""Hey There Lonely Girl,"" an early candidate (along with the Temps' Psychedelic Shack) for Soul Bummer of the Year. Rated just in case anyone suspects that I like all soul music.
"
FALSE,D+,The Man Who Built America,Horslips,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7031,"
In the past these rock pros from the Emerald Isle specialized in Gaelic folk motifs--pretty awful, but awful in their own way. This time they go for more generalized shamrock: organ doodles and half-baked harmonies haunt a concept album about Irish (note roots) immigrants who think quite a lot about the colleens (not called that, of course) left behind.
"
FALSE,D+,Drum,Hugo Largo,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4984,"
Former hardcore advocate and MTV copywriter Tim Sommer claims his latest fantasy reformulates ""the 30-year-old concept of what a rock band sounds like."" Right--and so do the Kronos Quartet, the Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir, and George Winston. With stringed/bowed instruments (no drums, get it?) under the sway of inaccurata soprano Mimi Goese--to say she sounds like Natalie Merchant mourning a lost orgasm understates her commitment to her affectations--this is the definition of arty twaddle. Inspirational Verse: ""Balancing glasses on your nose/By the crystal ball/Purified of vulgar things/Planted feet along the hall.""
"
FALSE,D+,Heads,Bob James,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11684,"
This was the number one jazz album in Record World not long ago, and I predict trouble. Already the people who put out those Environments nature soundscapes must be wondering why their records never make the list.
"
FALSE,D+,Frontiers,Journey,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5112,"
Just a reminder, for all who believe the jig is really up this time, of how much worse things might be: this top ten album could be outselling Pyromania, or Flashdance, or even Thriller. Worse still, Steve Perry could run for the Senate as a moderate Republican from, say, Nebraska, where his oratory would garner excellent press--and then, having shed his video-game interests, ram the tape tax through.
"
FALSE,D+,Rough Diamond,Madleen Kane,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7162,"
The perfect punk rock ashtray. Madleen looks like a Penthouse blonde with a camera-shy vulva and sings the same way--Andrea True telling little white lies. Promo copies of her LP come with a promo booklet featuring lotsa pix (dig those leg warmers) and text in six languages, including the original Japanese: ""She chooses to sing. With her own voice. . . . The wildest words grow tame. . . .""
"
FALSE,D+,Leftoverture,Kansas,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7164,"
Q: How do you tell American art-rockers from their European forebears? A: They sound dumber, they don't play as fast, and their fatalism lacks conviction. The question of humor remains open: Impressed as I am with titles like ""Father Padilla Meets the Perfect Gnat"" and Leftoverture itself, I find no parallels in the music.
"
FALSE,D+,Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra,Paul Kantner,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5122,"
A concept album about "" a San Francisco band that, in the near future, develops a computer assisted telepathic amplification technology"" which enables it to flee first to Australia and then to outer space? Godspeed, sez I.
"
FALSE,D+,Happy People/U Saved Me,R. Kelly,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12593,"
His productivity isn't exuberance, it's greed; his PG rating isn't scruples, it's cowardice. Happy People only gets steppin' when it flaunts his wealth, only achieves consciousness on a closing diptych that observes, ""We're so quick to say God bless America/But take away 'In God We Trust'/Tell me what the hell is wrong with us?"" Nice segue, Mr. Accused, right into the gross God-pop of U Saved Me, which points out that if you believe in God you'll earn a law degree and play for the Bulls, reflects humbly on divine forgiveness as it pertains to R. Kelly, and goes out on an anti-war hymn that shouts out to many African nations. Blatant consumerist fantasy-mongering from the tunes on down, and I believe that somewhere there's a court that'll convict him for it.
"
FALSE,D+,KGB,KGB,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7174,"
Heavy horseshit. Carmine Appice, Rick Grech, Barry Goldberg, and Ray (the K) Kennedy don't make a supergroup any more than Jim Price (last espied trying to bury Joe Cocker) makes a superproducer (overproducer, maybe). As for Mike Bloomfield--well, he's deserved better ever since he left Butterfield, and there's obviously no reason to believe he'll ever go out and get it.
"
FALSE,D+,In the Court of the Crimson King,King Crimson,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10882,"
The plus is because Peter Townshend likes it. This can also be said of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Beware the forthcoming hype--this is ersatz shit.

FALSE,D+,The Secret Value of Daydreaming,Julian Lennon,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10307,"
Just when you thought he couldn't get any worse he decides he has a right to be doing this, thus surrendering the aura of vulnerability that was Valotte's only spiritual virtue. And when this one stiffs I bet he comes up with a song about ""people who criticize.""

FALSE,D+,Discotheque,Herbie Mann,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7345,"
""You know what that is?"" said Carola, looking up from her book in astonishment. ""That's an easy-listening version of `Pick Up the Pieces.'"" Almost. The disco people seem to like this, but what do they know? After all, if the Chinese hordes were to overrun our nation, Herbie would be on the racks in a month with an LP called Little Red Book, and Chou might well like that one.
"
FALSE,D+,Smells Like Children,Marilyn Manson,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5920,"
Unmitigated consumer fraud--a mess of instrumentals, covers, and remixes designed to exploit its well-publicized tour, genderfuck cover art, titillating titles, and parental warning label. The lyrics to ""S****y Chicken Gang Bang"" are nonexistent, those to ""Everlasting C***sucker"" incomprehensible. Only ""F*** Frankie,"" a spoken-word number in which a female feigning sexual ecstasy reveals that it isn't ""Fool Frankie"" or ""Fire Frankie"" or ""Fast Frankie"" or for that matter ""Fist Frankie,"" delivers what it promises. It's easily the best thing on the record.
"
FALSE,D+,Love's the Thing,Barbara Mason,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7358,"
Not all soul singers bloom with age; some of them just get older. Ten years ago, young and foolish Barbara was cooing ""Yes I'm Ready"" as if the male seduction fantasy were her own, and it probably was. Now she sounds petulant, calculating, self-centered, not brave or sensitive enough to have a go at sisterhood nor bright enough to risk autonomy. Her sole commitment: fighting over men with other women. And she doesn't even have the guile to sheathe her whine.

FALSE,D+,Dave Mason at His Best,Dave Mason,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7363,"
Q: Given ABC/Blue Thumb's limited options, how much can this best-of differ from last year's? A: Well, it replaces ""Walk to the Point"" with the title tune from Headkeeper. Q: Why?
"
FALSE,D+,America Today,Curtis Mayfield,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7375,"
I had hoped the featureless doodling of his post-Super Fly albums just meant he was treading water while transferring from Viewlex to Warner Comm. Instead it appears that he was seeking new standards of incoherence.
"
FALSE,D+,Red Rose Speedway,Paul McCartney & Wings,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7380,"
Having decided that rock and roll was fun, a good enough idea within reason, he then decided that fun wasn't so much sex and humor and high spirits as aimless whimsy, and here he finally achieves disaster with that idea. His new love ballad meanders hopelessly where ""Yesterday"" shifted enticingly, and his screaming Little Richard tribute now sounds like Dicky Do and the Don'ts. Quite possibly the worst album ever made by a rock and roller of the first rank--unless David Crosby counts.

What a ripoff. Here I am expecting disco versions of ""Claire de Lune,"" Carmina Burana, and at least three Brandenburg concerti, and what do I get but eight tunes by W. Murphy? Take it from me, Walter--from Beethoven you make great schlock, transcendent schlock even, but from Murphy you just make schlock.

FALSE,D+,After the Fall,Nelson,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5846,"
Poignant in a way that sons of a drug-abusing father who was out of the house plenty even before the divorce should come up with such, er, positive messages. Disgusting in a way that children of pop privilege should luck into the extra sales gimmick of twinhood. And utterly apropos that Rick's boys are fifth-generation entertainers--circus, vaudeville, situation comedy, Hollywood rockabilly, and now . . . ""dynamic melodic vocal guitar rock."" ""Stylistically no one's doing what we're doing,"" Gunnar boasts, and he's right in a way. But what makes them truly unique is that he could just as well claim everyone's doing what they're doing.

Five of the six best songs here are on the debut; the other one, in case you care, is Robert Hunter's ""Kick in the Head."" Docked two notches for uselessness, another for the ""New Riders of the Purple Sage is a registered trademark,"" and yet another for putting a circle-R next to the title on the spine.

This is what folk-rock really means. This is what country-rock really means. This is what pop-rock really means. This is what all theories of salvation by music really mean.

FALSE,D+,Have You Never Been Mellow,Olivia Newton-John,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7519,"
After checking out the competition--I've given up on Helen Reddy, Anne Murray repeats herself, and Loretta Lynn's latest is a bummer--I began to entertain heathenish thoughts about this MOR nemesis, whose mid-Atlantic accent inspired Tammy Wynette to found a country music association designed to exclude her. At least this woman sounds sexy, says I to meself, but Carola soon set me straight. ""A geisha,"" she scoffed. ""She makes her voice smaller than it really is just to please men."" At which point I put away my heathenish thoughts and finished the dishes.

FALSE,D+,Nice,The Nice,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11052,"
The electric organ is an instrument of such vast and vague potential that its constant misuse is almost inevitable. One offender is Keith Emerson of the Nice, who has so much technical virtuosity he can quote Beethoven or somebody in the middle of a long Dave Brubeck cop. The only better indication of his level of taste is the whip he used to brandish as part of his Act. I don't know whether he still does this, because it is my practice to walk out after he starts his set with that horrible rondo. Lots of folks are impressed with Keith Emerson--Don Heckman reviewed this very record warmly in the Times--so I would like to designate the Nice Most Overrated Group This Side of the Moody Blues. Ugh.

It's reassuring that she came back to cut the album of her life, because this doomed musical's utter absence of pop instinct had me assuming the worst--that she was past learning what it means to communicate with an audience, that she'd twisted her angel's arm, that she didn't respect her own songs. Not only did she lack the modesty to stick with the best, she betrayed the good ones. The arrangements are dreck, and the performances--oy. Eminences from Rosanne Cash to the B-52's have covered her with the love she deserves, but the canniest Broadway belter would wreck material so sensibility-specific, and these unknowns are the kind they call hopefuls because deludeds wouldn't have the right ring.

Since the Osmonds are energetic enough to be worth criticizing, it ought to be mentioned that this group is not. All David Cassidy has is prime time and nice nipples, and the producer, Wes Farrell, has been giving commercialism a bad name for close to a decade now. Expert glop.

FALSE,D+,Reunion,"Peter, Paul & Mary",1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5656,"
To turn ""Forever Young"" into the post-hippie ""My Way,"" the way Dylan does, just means you've become a showbiz reprobate. To turn it into a rinky-dink reggae like these three geezers means you've been middle-aged and liberal since you were fifteen.

FALSE,D+,Atom Heart Mother,Pink Floyd,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2772,"
Believe it or not, the, er, suite on the first side is easier to take than the, gawd, songs on the second. Yeah, they do leave the singing to an anonymous semi-classical chorus, and yeah, they probably did get the horns for the fanfares at the same hiring hall. But at least the suite provides a few of the hypnotic melodies that made Ummagumma such an admirable record to fall asleep to.

FALSE,D+,Platinum Hook,Platinum Hook,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5696,"
Taken though I am with the nominal ingenuity of such pomp-rock tyros as Trillion and Tycoon, this disco concoction wins first prize in the latest name-that-band sweepstakes. Talk about your money and your mouth. But in the future perhaps an even more direct approach is indicated. Possibilities: Rack Jobber, Airplay, AOR, A&amp;R, Executive Vice President for Promotion and Marketing.

FALSE,D+,Definition of Real,Plies,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14304,"
Who better to address metaphysics than an autobiographical goon in a ski mask? He knows what reality is. It's giving grief a bad name. It's missing the daddy and dissing the baby mama. It's leaving a hater with a colostomy bag, collecting debts from suckers' wives in the only currency at their command, hiding in the bushes with your goon squad until it's time to empty 200 rounds into the object of your attention. Real hip-hop fans respect Plies for making like a goon. The rest of us are reminded of a colostomy bag. It all depends on your metaphysics.
"
FALSE,D+,Mista Don't Play Everythangs Workin,Project Pat,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10327,"
I don't try to play every horrible hip hop record--certainly not to the end. But this lump of thug gold got extra horrible after the single, so I stuck with it. He raps like your downstairs neighbor banging a broom on the ceiling, with beats to match. If a ho comes down from the suburbs and shoots him in the mouth, it'll only be poetic justice.
"
FALSE,D+,Southern Evil,Pumpadelic,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5832,"
Right, I didn't spell their name right--that would be aiding and abetting these been-and-gone scumbags, whose slogan is, ""Why wear one if you are one?"" That the term they prefer is ""dirtbag"" says everything we need know about how creamy they cum. I hope the repo man is already on whatever dumb shit they bought with their Kid-Rock-wannabe, David-Allan-Coe-nephew, ooh-now-I'm-really-impressed advance, which I also hope cost some a&amp;r fool his job. Another slogan: ""Abuse chicks, smell like hell, and drink Mad Dog."" Yet another: ""Give this record a spin and don't take it too seriously."" Oh, I get it--they were Only Joking.

FALSE,D+,Return of the Champions,Queen + Paul Rodgers,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13100,"
Where Freddie Mercury was a true queen, Paul Rodgers is a big disgrace. And that's not even counting the Bad Company cover, the Free cover, or, facts is facts, the HIV song.
"
FALSE,D+,Queensryche,Queensryche,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8246,"
Heavy metal's excuse for existing is its status as the generic expression of a white-male-adolescent underclass, but these five devotees of ""the American work ethic"" from an affluent Seattle suburb buy none of that--they're into selling. They woodshedded for two years, avoiding the seamy bar circuit in their pursuit of the rock and roll dream, which is of course a big contract. And when they got it they gave two weeks notice on their day jobs like the second-generation managers they are. What EMI paid for was the operatic tenor of Geoff Tate emoting ""fantasy"" lyrics over hyped-up new-metal tempos, and if you think the brand name panders to sexism and fascism, you're free to set up picket lines for as long as the First Amendment remains in force.
"
FALSE,D+,Romantic Warrior,Return to Forever,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7630,"
Right on schedule, two or three years behind John McLaughlin, Chick Corea tries to eat the fusion cyclotron. Where McLaughlin fell for a few silly orchestral trappings, Corea essays pompous, ersatz-classical compositions--while continuing to display Al DiMeola, Stanley Clarke, and Lenny White in all their dazzling vacuity. Jazz-rock's answer to Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer--the worst of both worlds.
"
FALSE,D+,Very Special Love Songs,Charlie Rich,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7635,"
If Behind Closed Doors compromised what Rich knew, this glop betrays it, which Charlie obviously can feel. The man sounds depressed and confused, as if he wishes Billy Sherrill's syrupy strings and sappy songs would go away but can't quite figure out why, since it was Sherrill who made him a star. Reportedly, the producer has socked a lot of Rich's blues and rock sides into the vault. Wait for them, and meanwhile thank him for these reissues: Fully Realized on Mercury (astringent strings), and Tomorrow Night on RCA (""Big Boss Man,"" not B.S.)
"
FALSE,D+,Stop All That Jazz,Leon Russell,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7703,"
The bad jokes start with the cover, which depicts Leon in a cannibal stewpot, the joke being that since he's not even tasty any more why would they bother? (Oo-ee.) Leon's version of ""If I Were a Carpenter"" has a part about rock stars and groupies that is even dumber than the original. (Stop, my sides are splitting.) And the title is a sly reference to the horn riffs which are the only music on this record I ever want to hear again. (Stop anyway.)

FALSE,D+,Healing Rain,Michael W. Smith,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12600,"
Dubya is the earthly king of Christian rock, returned to the pop fold after several profitable forays into the worship scene. His voice both strong and pleasant (though he's no Amy Grant), he commands an unusually detailed palette of stale CCR studio techniques (""Eagles Fly"" sports a sitar). He rocks mechanically hard on songs about perseverance and aspiration that don't mention the Lord's name and sounds sad about AIDS in Africa, or maybe famine (or animism). ""I Am Love"" is pretty mystical, and he essays ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" by the Jewish songwriter Paul Simon. In general, though, the words are not a plus.

"
FALSE,D+,A Star Is Born,Streisand/Kristofferson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7918,"
Due largely to Kristofferson, whose recording career will soon be as vestigial as George Segal's, the movie isn't quite the ripoff you'd figure, but the album, which lists as a pricey $8.98, most certainly is. As with all soundtracks, you get the stars' voices but not their chests, and Rupert Holmes and Paul Williams have ended up with the kind of rock and roll cliches that real rockers assume. What else could I expect? Neither Barbra nor Kris has made a listenable album, much less a stellar one, in the history of Consumer Guide.
"
FALSE,D+,The Sound of Sunshine,The Sunshine Band,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7931,"
You can't trust anybody anymore. Fronted by K.C., a/k/a H.W. Casey of Casey and Finch, they are the Booker T. and the MG's of the great Southern label of the '70s. But this is just the boys in the bands sans vocals, the post-soul equivalent of a Paul Kossoff or Vassar Clements LP. Wait for them to put ""Miss B."" on a K.C. collection.
"
FALSE,D+,The Original Soundtrack,10cc,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3,"
Is it supposed to be a parody to make your imitation movie mush more unbearable than any real thing, or just expert musicianship? And stretching your only decent melody (a nonsatirical love song) over six tedious minutes, is that a joke? And who is the butt of ""Une Nuit A Paris,"" the dumb yank or the greedy frog? Cor, or do I mean blimey, most of this wouldn't last long enough to close Saturday night.

FALSE,D+,38 Special,38 Special,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8000,"
For this group, booked by Ronnie Van Zant's agent, managed by his manager, and led by his kid brother, some special Inspiration Verse: ""It's a Saturday night ordinary/All the pros know what dues to pay/Ain't really good for nuthin'/'Cept to take some other rocker's chance away.""
"
FALSE,D+,Captured Live at the Forum,Three Dog Night,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11072,"
I once had hopes for this group, but success ruined them too, encouraging all of their most vulgar plastic-nigger excesses. Each of the (only) nine renditions is more flaccid than the studio version (that's right, no new material) and the ""Tenderness"" which closes the set, admittedly an exciting climax live, doesn't work any better than it did the first time it was recorded.
"
FALSE,D+,Topaz,Topaz,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11320,"
In which Rob Stoner proves his virtuosity by mixing arrogance, cynicism, and stupidity on one record, and Billy Cross comes up with Jasper Hutchinson, who can both whine and caterwaul in a mid-Atlantic Southwestern accent.
"
FALSE,D+,All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes,Pete Townshend,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8519,"
What intelligence must have gone into this album! What craft! What personal suffering! What tax-deductible business expenditure! In 1982, at 37, Townshend has somehow managed to conceive, record, and release a confessional song suite the pretentiousness of which could barely be imagined by an acid-damaged Bard drama major. That is, it's pretentious at an unprecedented level of difficulty--you have to pay years of dues before you can twist such long words into such unlikely rhymes and images and marshal arrangements of such intricate meaninglessness. A stupendous achievement.
"
FALSE,D+,In the Pocket,Stanley Turrentine,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8051,"
This is the sound track for a romantic comedy featuring Henry ""Hank"" Aaron as a bank vice-president whose hobby is private investigation. While ""digging"" into billiard-licensing payoffs, he falls for a lady eight-ball hustler (Leslie Uggams) who happens to be the daughter of Mr. Big, played by Barry White. Aaron decides to go crooked, but you know he'll never achieve the power or vulgarity of his father-in-law. Neither will Gene Page, who arranged this claptrap for Turrentine, a saxophonist whose fat, self-indulgent tone is apparently demanding the worst these days.
"
FALSE,D+,RA,Utopia,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8061,"
Todd Rundgren solo is a conundrum--a jaded, youthful pop technocrat whose inconsistency can be passed off as creative exuberance. Todd Rundgren bandleader is a disaster--a humorless rock progressive whose scientific know-how adds no saving details to his arid futurism. Roger Powell's circa-2001 improvements on the Hammond B-3 organ dominate as usual--it's not for nothing that Todd refers to the sun as ""Ra, holy synthesizer."" The first side is bad, the second unspeakable, yoking an appallingly unimaginative eighteen-minute ""fairy tale"" about stolen harmony to an infuriatingly impotent seven-minute preachment about Hiroshima. Why must those few rockers who espouse moral ideals do it so ineffectively? Oh, I know, mustn't criticize--just go out and achieve ""Eternal Love.""

Inspirational Verse (from Peter--note spelling--Hammill, yet): ""Fickle promises of treaty, fatal harbingers of war, futile orisons/swirl as on in the flight, this mad chase,/this surge across the marshy mud landscape/until the meaning is forgotten.""

FALSE,D+,Bow Down,Westside Connection,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5942,"
If you think East Coast Illuminati fantasies are silly, wait till you hear the ""gangsta rap in it's highest form"" that Ice Cube and two like-minded liars counter with. Not only that, they threaten to cut off the scrotum of ""All the Critics in New York."" Gosh, I sure hope they don't mean mine.
"
FALSE,D+,Whitesnake,Whitesnake,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8613,"
The attraction of this veteran pop-metal has got to be total predictability. The glistening solos, the surging crescendos, the familiar macho love rhymes, the tunes you can hum before the verse is over--not one heard before, yet every one somehow known. Who cares if they're an obscure nine-year-old vehicle for the guy who took over Deep Purple's vocal chores five years before that? Rock and roll's ninth or tenth ""generation"" of terrified high-school boys can call them their own. And may they pass from the ether before the eleven-year-olds who are just now sprouting pubic hair claim their MTV.

FALSE,D+,Soul-Crusher,White Zombie,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5821,"
The lyric sheet that spruces up this consumer-object-in-spite-of-itself makes a promise: ""Out of the chaos comes a reason."" But not out of the consumer object, an inedible noise-rock omelet distinguished from the competition by drawling voice-and-guitars. People consent to fascism because they think fascism will be more fun than this. They could be right.

FALSE,D+,Yanni Live at the Acropolis,Yanni,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4236,"
Affluent spirituality cum cornball romanticism from a florid New Age keyb maestro, his guitarless yet oddly rockish band (dig those drum solos), and one of those symphony orchestras that'll hook up with anyone who leaves enough cash on the night table. Given the august location of this ""event of a lifetime,"" it seems only appropriate to cite pseudo-Plutarch, the Roman protomusicologist who summed up the Greek ""new wave"" composers of the fifth century B.C.: ""Crexus, Timotheus and Philoxenus . . . displayed more vulgarity and a passion for novelty, and pursued the style nowadays called `popular' or `profiteering.' The result was that music limited to a few strings, and simple and dignified in character, went quite out of fashion."" Whether you're a diehard punk or a self-actualized higher being who got lost on the way to the futon ads, there's much to ponder in this ancient wisdom. And f.y.i.: Timotheus was the premier composer of his age, kind of a cross between Chopin, Wagner, and Andrew Lloyd Weber. If Yanni had any idea who he was, even Yanni would acknowledge that he had more to say to his time than Yanni does to his. I think.
