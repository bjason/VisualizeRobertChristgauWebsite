For the prelate who has everything, a Finnish (naturally) musicologist sings all of seven Elvis songs, including the oft-requested ""Wooden Heart (Cor ligneum),"" in what sounds from here like Eye-talian, but nobody's asking me. The style is Eurovision, the orchestration boilerplate, the voice tender and mild. Just thought you should know.

Sometimes I believe Warner Brothers can do no wrong. Well, this is wrong. Producer Richard Perry has done great things for Ella Fitzgerald and Fats Domino, but Bikel is beyond salvation. If he's a second-rate musical comedy star and a fourth-rate folkie, he's a sixth-rate contemporary singer. And I still call him Theodore.

For two years, BOA has toured harder than any band in history, with the biggest booking agent in the country breaking a trail of busted chops in front of them, and they still can't sell out the Academy of Music on a Saturday night. Why might that be? Because unlike most similar bands they have never achieved competence--they are actively untalented, incapable of even an interesting cop.

FALSE,D,Blues for We,Mel Brown,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10832,"
Bad album by an excellent guitarist. The fault is mostly in the production, which instead of dealing up obvious goop in the manner of Shorty Rogers and Harvey Mandel is so eclectic that it almost functions as a parody of eclecticism. Contains eight cuts: one black soul, one white soul, one country, one Lennon-McCartney, one bubblegum, one trad jazz, one blues, and one avant-garde jazz. Brown ain't that good. If you get turned on to him, try: ""The Wizard"" instead. Scanty personnel listings.

Any doubt that pop medievalism equals pop exoticism and both are the worse for it is put to rest by trance-dance's answer to Enya, who cheapen ideas that heretofore were merely shite with tunes to uplift or gull the unenlightened masses.  Since this will give said masses the wrong idea--something about anything you don't understand being mysterious so long as it's geographically or historically remote (hence not your own self-deluded life)--that just makes the music worse.

Anyone who tells you this accumulation of failed singles and unreleased tapes recaptures the fabulous rock and roll of yore must have spent 1966 in a garage trying to figure out the changes to ""She's Not There."" Tom Fogerty dominates, and back then the production was even duller than his singing and writing; John begins to sound like himself only on the two final cuts.

The brains behind Fleetwood Mac has always been a double threat because he's also the fingers--I've heard him keep up with Jerry Garcia on a good night. Here he lags behind Garcia on a bad jag, say side four of Live/Dead. Note title--maybe he's lost his marbles.

Apparently a compilation of old cuts (""Released through license from Quality Record Ltd.,"" the fine print says) this is recommended only to Guess Who scholars. They sure have come a ways.

FALSE,D,Rock Classics,Peter Hofmann,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4967,"
If all ten selections were as hilariously wrong as ""The House of the Rising Sun,"" which kicks off this chenu-wine Cherman heldentenor's bid for the unwashed market, it might qualify as a camp masterpiece. Instead it's merely dreadful, an object lesson in how poorly the technical paraphernalia of European good-and-beautiful serve American pop. You can hear why the effortless purity of Hofmann's three-octave range gets over with opera enthusiasts--Judy Collins would kill a whale for it. But ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" has never sounded lovelier than in Simon &amp; Garfunkel's original because their fragile harmonies underscore the modesty that makes the melody soar. And if not even Ray Charles could make much of ""The Long and Winding Road,"" he also had the good sense to avoid ""MacArthur Park"" and ""Nights in White Satin"" altogether. What is it they're supposed to have over in Europe? Oh, I remember--taste.

These evildoers sample as if enacting a worst-case scenario for the copyright mafia--except that they pay for the privilege, which means the copyright mafia doesn't even suffer as a result. And they trivialize every stupefyingly obvious piece of music they touch. Little Richard to Everlys to Cochran to Elvis to Haley--it's like being stuck on a tight-playlist oldies station that's afraid you may get a new idea about one of its touchstones if you hear it all the way through. So for perversity's sake I got one anyway: the big-band components of these syndrummed pastiches demonstrate that the great rupture wasn't as precipitous as we thought--that '50s teens lindied to rock and roll because the music swung. Which is fine with the evildoers, who mean to convince the '50s generation (and anybody else who'll buy it) that Chuck and Elvis have advanced on the nostalgia scale--that they're now as safe as the music our parents liked. This is the opposite of recontextualization, which suggests new meanings in familiar (and not so familiar) music, thus recharging it. Somebody sue the motherfuckers for crimes against history.

The broad arena-rock of expert nonentities robs the Beatle songs that jam this tour merch of all quirk and precision. Yet the Beatle songs still dwarf the proofs of his solo existence, which get lamer as he gets older. Either way his relentless smiley smile cloys on contact.

Ren isn't as half-assed or bald-faced as Eazy-E. But at least Eazy serves the social function of attacking Dr. Dre--while his delightful inner-sleeve photo of his homie in sequins and eye makeup doesn't make Dre a ""bitch,"" and wouldn't make him less a man if it did (though it may help explain Dre's, what shall we call it, insecurity around women), I figure the more energy these characters devote to tearing each other down the less we do. Ren, on the other hand, raps as dully as Dre himself--his blunt instrument doesn't approach the loud arrogance or thick timbre of, to choose an example strictly at random, Tim Dog's ""F--k Compton."" His rhymes are dumbass. To save on publishing he leaves most of the beats to his boys. And oy, what concepts. On side one he brutalizes black people, especially but by no means exclusively black women (sample witticism: ""Your pussy really stinks/Who the fuck bought you drinks?""). Then, to cover his tracks, he turns around and spouts the most ignorant, racist Afrocentric bullshit yet to hit the charts. Not only does he daydream about the random slaughter of ""Caucasians,"" he also advocates the murder of any black person disloyal enough to befriend them. Hey--I know those people.

It's hardly news that this platinum product is utter dogshit even by heavy metal standards; under direct orders from editors who don't know Iron Maiden from Wynton Marsalis, my beleaguered colleagues on the dailies have been saying so all year, and every insult goes into the press kit. Still, I must mention Mick Mars's dork-fingered guitar before getting to the one truly remarkable thing about this record: a track called ""Ten Seconds To Love"" in which Vince Neil actually seems to boast about how fast he can ejaculate (or as the lyric sheet puts it, ""cum"").

Donny listened to the radio for a couple of days and said to himself, ""Why should all these professional no-talents make the money? I'm a professional no-talent myself, and I've got a name and connections."" And in Dony's life the ability to create standard-issue pop-funk is a genuine liberation--he's Hollywood hip at last, and what a long hard road it must have been. But he sounds anonymous anyway, standard-issue, and corporate. After all, the best pop functions as a liberation even when it's formally received--celebrates a formula in ways that are audible, and infectious.

Musically, this is a step toward schlock that knows its name--a few smarmy melodies mixed in with the production values and synthesizer furbelows. Thematically, it's both sophomoric and disgusting--programmatic misogyny rooted in sexual rejections that were clearly deserved.

Assuming they've ever paid the rent in their lives, I mean? Maybe kids who crave intimacy as much as amateur sociologists claim--so much that they turn musical doodles into love objects, attributing to them the imaginary smarts and cutes long-distance crushes so often impart. Those of us who prefer talent will make out maybe four tunes amid the strum and clatter, including the autodestructing ""Soul Mate"" and the thematic ""Temporary Dream.""

Brief pieces suffused with the twixt-strings-and-keyboard echoes that are the special curse of synthesizers on today's auriculum, they favor harpsichord over piano and will dabble in anything a synth can, including drums and voices.

Look what he's done to ""Look What They've Done To My Song, Ma""--copped it--and ask your schoolteacher friends whether show-and-tell isn't considered a white cultural imposition in ghetto schools. What can it all mean?

In a moment of short-lived sympathy, I theorized that maybe this record bore the same ironic relationship to laid-back International Pop Music Community country-rock as the Stones' records bear to ordinary heavy metal. If so, the irony is that this is doubly sexist and Bill really doesn't know how to sing.

What hath folk-rock wrought? Or is it Marin County, or ""owning"" your own label? A lot of third-hand Barney Kessel and/or Dave Brubeck that couldn't have second-billed at the Half Note in 1957 plus some very occasional vocals from ol' Jess, who sounds like Mel Torme after 2000 micrograms and three months of Diet No. 7. Country vibes don't mean spilling your seed on the ground.
