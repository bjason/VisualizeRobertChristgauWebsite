FALSE,C+,Greatest Hits,Abba,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6279,"
Although four of these songs have gone top twenty here, the title commemorates the band's conquest of such places as West Germany and Costa Rica, where Abba's Europop is the biggest thing since the Beazosmonds. Americans with an attraction to vacuums, late capitalism, and satellite TV adduce Phil Spector and the Brill Building Book of Hooks in Abba's defense, but the band's real tradition is the advertising jingle, and I'm sure their disinclination to sing like Negroes reassures the Europopuli. Pervasive airplay might transform what is now a nagging annoyance into an aural totem. It might also transform it into an ashtray. God bless America, we're not likely to find out which.

FALSE,C+,Dirty Deeds Done Cheap,AC/DC,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4286,"
A 1976 Australian LP released in the wake of their ascension to the U.S. top ten, this is where those of us who weren't paying attention meet the blokelike croak of the legendary Bon Scott, asphyxiated by his own vomit shortly after Highway to Hell broke them Stateside. Now I understand why they say Brian Johnson has a great voice--he's got about about three times the range and wattage, the bloke as fantasy-fiction demigod. But those who prefer Scott's charm have a point. Like Ian Hunter or Roger Chapman though without their panache, he has fun being a dirty young man--he almost slavers through ""Ain't No Fun Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire,"" and ""Big Balls"" is fully outrageous in its class hostility. Needless to say, sexual hostility--disguised as fun, of course--is more his speed.

FALSE,C+,Blow Up Your Video,AC/DC,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4289,"
The brutal truth is that sexism has never kept a great rock-and-roller down--from Muddy to Lemmy, lots of dynamite music has objectified women in objectionable ways. But rotely is not among those ways. I mean, these guys have never known how to throw a party. Sure their costumery is good for a laugh, but Brian Johnson shrieks too much, which gets positively painful as he grows hoarse with the encroaching years, and they've always been stingy with their famous killer riffs. Their reunion with Vanda &amp; Young no more signals their renewed determination to make good albums than Elton John's reunion with Bernie Taupin. It signals commercial panic, and unlike Elton they're unlikely to reverse their downward sales path over the long haul. I eagerly await their retirement and the dynamite best-of I trust will prove subsequent upon it.

FALSE,C+,Five-a-Side,Ace,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6282,"
The single, ""How Long,"" is welcomed by some desperate souls as a breakthrough for England's pub rock movement. Bet if John David Souther lived in England he'd play pubs too. Super catchy, but even more banal than that term used as a superlative ordinarily implies, sung and played with a mildness infuriating in musicians of such skill but totally appropriate to lyricists of such underweening triviality.

It's got to be deliberate, the voice of the common man or some such. Nevertheless, making all allowances--overlooking quotes/references (""eight miles high""), universals (""the rent is due""), attempted wordplay (""a table for one and a broken heart to go""), and simple idioms (""count me in,"" ""white flag,"" ""heaven knows,"" ""it's up to you"")--I count an astonishing fifty-six full-fledged clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s""caught in the crossfire"" in the first line to ""the worst is over"" in the third-to-last. And while ""Only the Strong Survive,"" the biggest offender with twelve, streamrollers across despite it all, neither Don Henley soul nor emergent social conscience justify the dumbness density. I know the salt of the earth is the shape of things to come, but these words of wisdom are beyond the pale.

Acid house isn't stupid music; it isn't even bad music. It's music for some other species--with the Other, as always, relative to where one's Self happens to hang out. Singerless and virtually wordless, undeviating in its ""textless"" functionalism, it's impervious to consumer guidance: nobody who doesn't dance to it knows it exists, and nobody who does is gonna believe an alien like me. Nevertheless, it does exist, so say this: the best analogy isn't disco (though cf. MFSB and the Salsoul Orchestra) or dub or new age. It's fusion--beyond virtuosity, yet hopelessly in love with the almighty keyb. Though this guy isn't as weird and tricky as 808 State or A Guy Called Gerald at their fleeting best, his bottom seems suited to survival in an oxygenated environment, and once in a while he surges into something resembling life. There's the review. Now you can talk about it at parties.

Never let it be said that the youth of America can't recognize quality. These guys are spectacularly expert--with their dybbuk-or-angel vocal switchoffs, compulsive tempo shifts, dramatic dynamics, and multiple melodic and rhythmic elements, they're as exhausting to listen to as Stan Kenton, and with almost as much insight into the human heart. They predicate their worldview on their inability to win the love of Lara Croft, who led them on in a summer romance they now realize was an amoral farrago of lies and deception. So they consign her to many different hells, from ordinary suicide to my favorite: ""Watch the stars turn you to nothing."" And she thought she was so great.

""Genie in a Bottle"" was such a dazzlingly clever piece of teen self-exploration cum sexploitation that it seemed the better part of valor to hope it was a fluke. But this was avoidance--like LeAnn and unlike Britney, Christina already has ""adult"" grit and phrasing down pat, and so threatens to join Gloria, Mariah, Celine, and LeAnn herself in the endless parade of Diane Warren-fueled divas-by-fiat hitting high notes and signifying less than nothing. ""What a Girl Wants"" is clever, too, but in a far less ingratiating way--like its two-hour promotional video writ small, it raises the question of how this ruthlessly atypical young careerist can presume to advise girls not cursed with her ambition, and the fear that some of them will make her a role model regardless. Give me Left Eye any day.

The heartening sense of overall conviction here doesn't extend to many specifics, with the surprising exception of Gregg's rough yet detailed vocals.

FALSE,C+,Public Domain,Dave Alvin,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5215,"
If Harry Smith is what some people love about folk music, this is what other people hate about it, summed up by a title that claims humility as it sneaks presumption in the stage door--a title worthy of a brilliant record and dishonored by this dull one. Alvin can be a deft lyricist in the colloquial-songpoet mode, pinning the kind of homely literary detail the folk regularly established or bypassed with commonplaces, absurdities, generalizations, and luck. But it took him years to learn to sing his own stuff, and interpreting the canon he's worse than hopeless. It's not that these songs are all obvious or overdone--this nonfolkie had never heard a few of them. It's that they're so soft they squish even when Alvin tries to rev one past you, which usually he doesn't.

Will someone in the chart department tell us the last time the follow-up to a number-one album endured only eight weeks on the Billboard 200, topping out at 55? Although it's still alive on the r&amp;b list, which they can claim proves a racial militance that was never in doubt or the point, this looks like a stiff of historical proportions, more evidence that their short-term commercial success was a long-term musical fraud--limp, sententious rap feel-goodism quickly forgotten once it failed to drive the scary stuff away. Maybe in another three years, five months, and two days they'll come up with another slice of life like ""Tennessee""--or another guilt trip like ""Mr. Wendal."" But they don't have that long.

OK, two nice if slightly deliberate albums of power pop go virtually unnoticed, so you up the power, especially since you're running out of the cute tunes 'n' tricks that provide the pop. But then it isn't power pop any more--sounds almost like Angel, or Queen. Sounds pretty desperate, too.

Side one is playable, although ""God Bless the Child"" was born under a bad sign, and the hot live performances don't suit the living room as well as the more delicate studio versions available on three out of five songs. Side two, however, sounds terribly forced. Not only does John Nicholas's overstated, bloozey original make clear that Leroy Preston's songwriting is going to be missed, but his duet with Chris O'Connell is too close to Peggy Scott and Jo-Jo Benson to remain so far away. And ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" might just as well be ""Saints,"" or ""Send in the Clowns.""

These black Brits' considerable commercial success in their non-Ethiopian homeland guarantees no more than any other band's commercial success; though they're avowedly more roots, their songs for lovers (""Your Recipe"") and rhythmic extensions (""Soca Rumba"") are as serviceably undistinguished as those of Third World, a commercially successful band indeed. And I'm sure they could have made their U.S. introductions more winningly than with a year's dub album followed by a live job. Inspirational Intro: ""You know what live and direct mean? It mean live and direct.""

A rather ordinary-sounding white Southern boogie band, except that this one has its roots in pop--they began as the Candymen, the greatest cover band in history. Only they actually began as Roy Orbison's backup band. As you might imagine, they're tighter and slicker than your ordinary boogie band, which all things considered is a small boon. I hope somebody on Capricorn covers ""Wrong."" And I hope they find something as good as, oh, ""Good Vibrations"" to cover themselves.

For H.R. this precedent-setting band has devolved into a money gig--he feels more comfortable juicing his Afro-universalist utterances with the reggae-inflected world-rock of his solo records and his alternate group Human Rights. And though the title tune claims to jam the disco with acid rock and hardcore rather than hip hop/go go/bebop, the shit sure sounds like metal to me. Sure sounds like Dr. Know, too--on his own H.R. is only a bore, but in this context his male chauvinist arrogance comes through loud if not clear.

Where five years ago Baker was a soul singer who honored the traditional soul audience's lounge leanings, now she's an arena-lounge singer manufacturing generalized intimacy for 26-to-45s. Rid of funky minor-label producer-songwriter Patrick Moten, she composed two tracks for Rapture and worked on a third. Here she's down to two collaborations as the credits edge toward El Lay--if Britten-Lyle and the Perris have anted up, can Carole Bayer Sager and Toto be far behind? She's not a total loss yet--despite the universal lyrics and inflated choruses, three tracks make something of her established standards.

I admit to a weakness for Shel Silverstein, who wrote all fourteen songs on this record--or rather, these two records, as this is Nashville's first country oratorio or something (subject: America or something). But even for a fan, Silverstein's jokes and tugs on the heartstrings wear thin after half an hour (if not ten minutes). Nor does the audience of cronies yukking it up and singing along do much for Bare's interpretations, which verge on the obvious under the best of circumstances.

In case you were wondering what Bill Graham's been up to, here he is directing the career of a Nashville veteran with a great ear who's never fulfilled his great expectations. His CBS debut, Bare, was a Shel Silverstein collaboration that offered its fair share of pleasures, but it didn't sell, so this one goes rock-schlock, befouling good songs with strings that aren't up to Parton and Byrdsy cadences that aren't up to McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman. Fortunately, the new one hasn't sold either.

She's got a fine little instrument, like a nubile Bonnie Bramlett--the drawl pure cracker, the pitch and rhythm deep blue. But what she's selling with it is tractability.

Not so terrible, I caught myself thinking first time I played these imaginary soundtracks, and they're not--not by the standard of the early-'50s radio mush preserved on the companion Baxter's Best (""Unchained Melody,"" ""I Love Paris,"" oy). Here, selections from Ritual of the Savage and its many successors exploit mallet instruments with some verve and tickle those nostalgic for their grandparents' fantasies of benign imperialism. But even in the same dubious vein, Esquivel has more razzmatazz and Martin Denny is crucially sparer. The strings and occasional brass are de trop enough--if you can abide the choruses doo-dooing and ahh-ahhing away, start monitoring your insulin levels.

Rollermania in this country was pretty depressing--1977's ""You Made Me Believe in Magic,"" the last of their three top-tenners, could have been by Bread or Barry Manilow, and better the Partridge Family than that. Still, they got to put their name on three great singles, more than most people who make albums (or singles) manage: the number-one breakthrough ""Saturday Night,"" the semistiff ""Rock and Roll Love Letter,"" and the completely stiff ""Yesterday's Heroes,"" a 1976 song about how they had to take command or fade away that was written for them--at their command, I'm sure--by Vanda &amp; Young.

They can't have much faith in the new one if they're loss-leading with an old one (the one that turned them into a cult band, now finally--how did we stand the wait?--available in its pristine mono form). And indeed, there's no reason they should. Despite the title, it's not some sort of primitive surf doowop--sounds a lot like Friends and Holland to me. Fairly pleasant, but even the highlights aren't all that hot: a nice Brian Wilson oeuvre called ""Marcella"" (sounds like Smiley Smile) and a silly gospel song for the Maharishi.

The Brit version made sense, because lots of Beatle songs are unavailable on U.K. LP. In the U.S. the group's been cannibalized more efficiently--not counting the curious two-second Sgt. Pepper outgroove, only five of fourteen songs here are unknown to owners of their Capitol albums catalogue. Two early Lennon-McCartneys, the assured close-harmony ""Misery"" and the fragile quavery ""There's a Place,"" are very much worth your acquaintance. ""Sie Liebt Dich"" is fun, ""You Know My Name (Look Up My Number)"" is a goof, and ""The Inner Light"" is a B side--George's B side. Except for ""Across the Universe,"" which Phil Spector did not improve, not one of the nine alternate versions differs from the original by more than a whit. The U.K. Please Please Me includes ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place."" I regard it as a superior investment.

But stick this follow-up in the changer and the magic of compression raises the volume of these transparently calculated songs to barrage level. Even doing her humble bit, she yells in your ear. So what's all this about how she just lost her job but has so many reasons to be happy anyway--and so do you, girlie! Though the Sean Kingston collab generated sales and remixes and the album hung around in the top 40, it's yet to go gold. I never rejoice about the death of the record business.

Banned from South Africa himself, Belafonte sent arranger Richard Cummings and lyricist Jake Holmes in to lay down tracks with Makgona Tsohle, Brenda Fassie, even the Soul Brothers (who turned Simon down), and both representatives made a mess with the boss's full approval--Makgona Tsohle play cream cheese, the Zulu word for power turns into a woman's name, and the interracial love duet with Jennifer Warnes is no less saccharine for being punishable by death. Yet the Obed Ngobeni-backed title song is a triumph--a tremendously hot piece of assimilationist mbaqanga that conveys apartheid's insanity and mbaqanga's joy-pain in English ironic enough to get past the SABC.

From showbiz ""hard rock"" (""Heartbreaker"") to big-beat ""cabaret"" (""Don't Let It Show"") to received ""futurism"" (""My Clone Sleeps Alone"") to fake-Blondie ""Eurodisco"" (""We Live for Love""), she shows about as much aesthetic principle as Don Kirshner. Though she does have a better voice than Kirshner.

FALSE,C+,In Flight,George Benson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6388,"
Upon reflection, it seems to me that what Benson does these days isn't a sellout but an apotheosis--this kind of palaver has been the soul of jazz guitar since the '50s. Turn those amps up! Let's hear some distortion!
"
FALSE,C+,Pleasure Victim,Berlin,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8212,"
Although my tastes in porn don't run to designer whips, Terri Nunn's sex-object impersonation on the cunningly entitled ""Sex (I'm a . . .)"" generates a mild buzz. But that's the only good part--the rest is flimsy synth-pop sans even a flash of pink, unless songs about the Metro make you wet your pants.
"
FALSE,C+,I'm Your Woman,Sandra Bernhard,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8213,"
Marianne Faithfull's survivor and Grace Jones's dominatrix both went up against Barry Reynolds's austere mechanics from strength, and better men wrote their best songs--John Lennon, Iggy Pop, Shel Silverstein, Melvin Van Peebles. The music here is Reynolds's ballgame, and if Bernhard's compulsively slippery irony is strength, I'm a great artist. I assume she gets to certain under-30 women because they find the twin escapes of dominance and submission wickedly seductive, and trust they're far enough from her fantasy star-world to take her as a metaphor for what's most oppressed and/or neurotic in themselves. I assume guys think she's more fun than reading the personals.

FALSE,C+,Music: The Best of the Beta Band,The Beta Band,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13105,"
Rock-ambient Brits, you remember. Four albums, 1998-2004. First one actually three EPs. Can't remember how I was convinced to enjoy the second--has some tunes, my notes say, and I try to be kind. Young alt fans do get weary, so their third and fourth suffered disregard, and the Betas broke up in despair, dismay, or a snit. Where those tunes might be hiding on this prematurely useless 16-song best-of I don't have the heart to figure out. Why nine of the 16 are repeated on the 13-song farewell concert that inflates the package's price only their accountant knows for sure. Kindness can be such a waste of time.

FALSE,C+,Megatop Phoenix,Big Audio Dynamite,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4387,"
Forward-looking of Mick to devote himself to interracial rock-the-house. But strip away the samples and give the lyrics the respect they deserve and you're left with a mild voice over beats so dinky only college radio could dance to them. Plus a sweet pop song that isn't called ""Feelings"" because that title's taken.
"
FALSE,C+,Slam,Big Dipper,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5838,"
Marginally more lyrical on Epic than on Homestead (less like the Embarrassment, which I take as evolution rather than compromise), their one great new postpunk moment is called ""Monsters of Jazz"" (about music, natch). They exemplify Amerindie's throw-it-up-against-the-wall phase--modestly talented bands granted their arbitrary shot, stiffing, and diluting the credibility and capital available to inspired music. No tragedy, because it isn't important enough. Just sad.

FALSE,C+,Hometown Boy Makes Good,Elvin Bishop,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1147,"
Elvin sounds like he's on automatic, Mickey Thomas sounds like he wants to be a rock and roll star, and this album sounds like it might fly apart if you were to spin it at forty-five by mistake. It's still fun, I guess. But not enough fun.
"
FALSE,C+,Careless,Stephen Bishop,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6404,"
Bishop ain't bad for a pop singer-songwriter--his voice is three-quarters Simon and one-quarter Garfunkel and he's got as much brains as and fewer pretensions than either. He commits no sins. Omits quite a few, though--even boasts that he's outgrown material like ""I Feel So Miserable Without You, It's Almost Like Having You Here.""
"
FALSE,C+,Post,Bjï¿½ï,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6241,"
This well-regarded little item rekindles my primeval suspicion of Europeans who presume to ""improve"" on rock and roll (or for that matter Betty Hutton, originator of the best song here). I don't miss the Sugarcubes' guitars per se so much as their commitment to the groove, which--sporadic though it would remain, Iceland not being one of your blues hotbeds--might shore up the limited but real intrinsic interest of her eccentric instrumentation, electronic timbres, etc. Then there's her, how shall I say it, self-involved vocal devices. Which brings us to, right, her lyrics, which might hit home harder if she'd grown up speaking the English she'll die singing, but probably wouldn't. Anybody out there remember Dagmar Krause? German, Henry Cow, into artsong and proud of it? Well, take my word for it. She was no great shakes either. But at least she had politics.

Two years ago, when they were licking broken cymbals and mixing in keyb groans from a reel-to-reel, I told my diary they reminded me of the Swans and were as likely to go classical. So who've they been listening to? Somebody tinklier than I would have figured. Elliott Carter? Stockhausen to lay some arid accessibility on your ass? ""Original"" of them if so, they are that. Novelty records--rock and rollers can never get enough of them.

FALSE,C+,Slip It In,Black Flag,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4402,"
""Slip It In"" is by somebody who learned about sex from movies. ""Black Coffee"" carries this antidrug thing too far. ""Wound Up"" could be tighter. ""Rat's Eyes"" cries out in agony for Sabbath's chops. ""Obliteration"" is an ace accompanist's solo turn. ""The Bars"" isn't about prison--or saloons. ""My Ghetto"" is an outtake from the rant side of Damaged. ""You're Not Evil"" is right on.

FALSE,C+,Blind Melon,Blind Melon,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5805,"
The biggest assholes yet to go alternative platinum share management with Guns 'N Roses and woodshedded in El Lay before moving to North Carolina to research their image. Musically they're kind of a cross between Rhinoceros and Savage Resurrection, although without the steamroller drive of the former or the messy idealism of the latter. They do boast better chops, however. A quarter-century down the line, that's what bizzers call progress--chops, and MTV.

FALSE,C+,Natural High,Bloodstone,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6420,"
Any album that includes both a hit soul-harmony ballad and ""Bo Diddley"" (the band's from England, natch) deserves a second listen. But believe me, the tenth is a dubious investment.

FALSE,C+,I Wanna Be a Lifeguard,Blotto,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4418,"
One of indie rock's greatest failures stories, they burst upon us in 1980 with the title tune, a novelty number at least as hilarious as ""Snoopy vs. the Red Baron"" (which couldn't have cracked commercial radio in the boring commercial '80s either, I bet). Here they compile a best-of from their DIY EPs/LPs for a slightly larger DIY concern--they would have been happy to sign with a major, but not for shit money, no sir. In among the mildly amusing and hopelessly unfunny you'll find the definitive top-40 bar-band parody ""(We Are) The Nowtones."" The metal parody they don't have the chops for.
"
FALSE,C+,Blue Angel,Blue Angel,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4424,"
There's a lyric sheet for some reason, and God knows the colorized cover cultivates a look, but the selling point of this uptown power pop is Cyndi Lauper's cute, zaftig voice--the songs all feature little toon-tricks designed to show off its swoops and swells. Try the band feature, a '50s cover that goes ""Wo, wo, cut out,"" and the autobiographical '50s tribute, ""Late.""
"
FALSE,C+,The Magic of the Blue,Blue Magic,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6426,"
I've never been able to go all the way with groups that specialize in repressed-backbeat falsetto ballads. The few I've liked--only the Chi-Lites and the Stylistics for more than one song at a time--barely redeemed their simpiness by sounding sincere, or do I mean dumb, and in the wake of an inspired debut these hotshots just don't. Instant professionalism, I guess, combined with the usual song fatigue. Recommended only to those who want to know what the Stylistics will sound like after Russell Thompkins gets his B.A. and learns to sing like a sane, responsible adult.
"
FALSE,C+,On Your Feet or on Your Knees,Blue Oyster Cult,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6428,"
This live double, proof that they've earned the right to issue cheapo product, is a fitting testament. The packaging makes their ominoso joke more explicit than it's ever been, and if the music is humdrum more often than searing, maybe that means these closet intellectuals have finally achieved the transubstantiation of their most baroque fantasies.
"
FALSE,C+,Briefcase Full of Blues,Blues Brothers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6432,"
The studio-superstar backup band isn't exactly long on personality, but it rocks, and almost every song ranks as an underrecorded classic. John Belushi goes out of his way--earnestly, even awkwardly--to identify the original artists, which cancels out the Rasta jokes on ""Groove Me."" However. If Belushi told those jokes to supply his fans with their ration of dope humor, then shame on him. But if he was just nervous about treading in the voiceprints of Junior Wells and King Floyd, he had reason--he's not as convincing as most white blues singers, much less Junior Wells or King Floyd. Is this a top-ten album because people actually want to listen to it? Inspirational Patter: ""I'd suggest you buy as many blues albums as you can.""
"
FALSE,C+,Open,Blues Image,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6433,"
I love ""Ride Captain Ride,"" really. But the only mystery ship that transports anyone from the San Francisco Bay to Parchman Farm is rock and roll--rock and roll more inspired than this.
"
FALSE,C+,Dedication,Gary U.S. Bonds,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4429,"
This is impressive and good-hearted. Not only did B. Springsteen get a record deal for the rock and roller whose oldies have been topping B.'s show since whenever, he got him a hit. Featuring the voice of none other than B. Springsteen, who comes more naturally to these impressive, good-hearted, new B. Springsteen songs (as well as the Dylan and Browne and Lennon-McCartney oldies) than the rock and roller. For one thing, B. has more soul.
"
FALSE,C+,"For Emma, Forever Ago",Bon Iver,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14260,"
Re-accessing Robert Creeley gave me a grip on these solitary meditations, which lose definition faster than an angel's breath on a January morn. Beloved by sensitive young men like Justin Vernon, who recorded the album one winter in his father's Wisconsin hunting cabin after breaking up with his band and his girlfriend in North Carolina, the lyrics aren't as lax as one might fear--as in Creeley, the lines are short and the diction is spare. But the turns of phrase are usually cul-de-sacs, the flights into obscurity have bum wings, and do you really prefer, for instance, Vernon's best-in-show ""Now all your love is wasted?/Then who the hell was I?"" (much less ""Only love is all maroon/Lapping lakes like leery loons"") to this Creeley ordinaire: ""Soon everything will be sold/and I can go back home/by myself again/and try to be a man""? Yea, sigh his admirers sensitively, in musical context, you old cynic. His falsetto, his murmurs, his accompaniment--they're all so lonely, as when he introduces the climactic ""Re: Stacks"" with a doleful 45-second guitar strum. To which I can only compare Ralph Carney's grooveful, multifaceted 45-second intro to ""The Invoice,"" which in its subsequent minute says more about our shared aloneness than Vernon's whole record.
"
FALSE,C+,New Jersey,Bon Jovi,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4433,"
I see three ways to take the transparently pseudo Springsteenian sincerity of Jon's bid to improve his artistic reputation and his platinum multiple at the same time. You could lie back and enjoy its giant hooks, identifying with the masses all the while. You could cheer its de facto deconstruction of rock ""authenticity."" Or you could blow lunch. As someone who learned to love ""Livin' on a Prayer"" in heavy rotation at a swimming pool, I reserve the right to choose option one upon suitable stimulus from somebody else's radio. Now pass the bucket.
"
FALSE,C+,Have a Nice Day,Bon Jovi,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13059,"
Bon Jovi mean so little long or short term that it was only with this redolently entitled cheese bomb that I realized they hadn't actually broken up back in the fabled '90s. (Really--I took all their '00s albums for reunion one-shots, and couldn't figure out why the product kept coming in the three seconds I thought about it.) The commercial secret is as unchanging as Jon-Jon's mysteriously unwrinkled countenance--hard rock so inoffensive it's less Aerosmith than Air Supply. Not only is it impossible to tell whether the one called ""Bells of Freedom"" is pro- or anti-Bush, it's impossible to tell whether it's patriotic. A depressing argument for the existence of that intellectual fairy tale, the passive mass audience.

FALSE,C+,This Boot Is Made for Fonk-n.,Bootsy's Rubber Band,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=421,"
Bootsy sounds like a kiddie-show host at the end of his tether--trotting out sound effects, Steve Martin imitations, desperate appeals to DJs, anything he can think of. Except a good riff.

FALSE,C+,Diamond Dogs,David Bowie,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=956,"
In which a man who has always turned his genuine if unendearing talent for image manipulation to the service of his dubious literary and theatrical gifts evolves from harmless kitsch into pernicious sensationalism. Despite two good songs and some thoughtful (if unhummable) rock sonorities, this is doomsday purveyed from a pleasure dome. Message: eat, snort, and be pervy, for tomorrow we shall be peoploids--but tonight how about buying this piece of plastic? Say nay.
"
FALSE,C+,Never Let Me Down,David Bowie,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4440,"
Maybe he's lost touch so completely that he's reduced to cannibalizing himself just when the market dictates the most drastic image shift of his chameleon career. But maybe this is just his way of melding two au courant concepts, Springsteenian rock and multiproducer crossover. After all, why pay good money to outsiders when your own trunk of disguises is there for the rummaging? Of course, crossover artistes can generally sing. When Bowie wants to play the vocalist, he still puts on a bad Anthony Newley imitation.
"
FALSE,C+,Heathen,David Bowie,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11554,"
The ""Bowie's back"" huzzahs that accompany every one of this music mill's new releases beg the question of what he's back to and from. The reason Englishmen have actually touted him as the greatest rock artiste of all time is that he's the least American major rock artiste of all time, which is one reason his careful brand maintenance isn't filling any arenas over here. Just to be mean I compared his latest phoenix imitation to 1979's Lodger, a certified nonclassic I always kind of liked. Lodger won easy. He has indeed Learned to Sing, thus rendering himself more the chansonnier only art-rockers ever wanted him to be, and the strain is hell on his sense of humor. The textures are nicer now, but whose aren't? And while the songwriting ain't bad, it also ain't that good. Just switch between the Black Francis cover and any other track and you'll know exactly what I mean.

Mike Chapman adds few if any hooks and Annabella Lwin shockingly little verve to their pattering Afrobeats. None of Malcolm McLaren's pubescent sex fantasies was half as dumb or exploitative as ""Aphrodisiac."" And though I'm glad they're expressing themselves, only the glorious ""Rikki Dee"" (""I work at the WC"") tells me any teenage news I hadn't guessed.

Touted by the Dandy Warhols in the impressive Dig, Anton Newcombe gets a no doubt small, no doubt excessive cash advance to prove his genius with 38 songs the world passed on the first time. The world was right, and will be right again every time Newcombe revives. His recombined riffs rarely break the shambolic surface, and whenever two consecutive lines of lyric grab and hold, they complain. The Dandy Warhols' drones have some pull to them, their hooks some sock. They're funny, too. They overrate Newcombe because they do with panache and professionalism what he does with heroin and lies, and feel guilty about it.

FALSE,C+,The Age of Consent,Bronski Beat,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4460,"
Good politics don't have to be this monochromatic, and neither do albums with two good singles on them. Problem's pretty simple--the narrow dynamic range that afflicts so many falsettos, even those with impeccable reasons for singing like women. And before you call me persnickety, swear you wouldn't rather hear Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love.""
"
FALSE,C+,Right On Time,The Brothers Johnson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6461,"
I once tagged Earth, Wind &amp; Fire as black MOR, but these guys straightened out my categories. EW&amp;F is more like Elton John or early Supremes--formularized music worked out with undeniable verve. This is more in the area of Foreigner or Firefall--pop professionalism reduced to a concept in which all annoyances and other signs of life are eliminated. Funk is often automatic, but it must take some heavy discipline to make it bland.

FALSE,C+,Alright Again!,Clarence Gatemouth Brown,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=611,"
Texans, Jesus--give them a black man in a cowboy hat and they won't stop jawing about the wide open spaces until they fall off the barstool. And what is this thing they have for blues brass in platoons? I mean, Bobby Bland can sing over, under, and around that shit, but this old pro obviously hasn't bulled his way past a tenor sax in twenty years. Still packs a fairly sharp guitar, I grant you, and he can make you listen up with that violin of his. But he's fronting some very unswinging white boys, and his idea of contemporary is the stock-market woes of small businessmen.

FALSE,C+,Sho Is Funky Down Here,James Brown,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6465,"
Brown's farewell to his own indie label is so outre purists will probably prize it. Rock-funk instrumentals dominated by (literally) anonymous electric piano and guitar, both more rock than funk, which would never be said of the rhythm section. At moments it sounds like JB Meets BB--and I don't mean the bluesman, I mean Bela Bartok--in the person of arranger Dave Matthews. As for JB, he grunts a few times. Veddy interesting.

If Someone were to airlift this one tape to you in the tundra, the remakes would be godsends. But if you own another version of ""Sex Machine"" you own a better one. Ditto ""I Feel Good,"" ditto every aimless solo, and ditto the reading from Rand-McNally.

FALSE,C+,People,James Brown,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4462,"
Anybody who thinks his first Brad Shapiro album was mechanical should get a load of what a real assembly line sounds like. Original Disco Man was a labor of vanity, and when it didn't hype his career the way he'd been told it would JB went back on automatic. Shapiro &amp; Co. respond in kind.
"
FALSE,C+,Gravity,James Brown,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4466,"
Not a James Brown album--a James Brown-influenced Dan Hartman record, with James Brown on vocals. Unlike Brad Shapiro, who manufactured good music this way in 1979, Hartman takes his humdrum copyrights and urges the great one to go for the expressiveness he hasn't commanded in over a decade rather than the rhythm he'll take to his grave. Don't believe me--just compare any of Polydor's most recent compilations: James Brown's Funky People (featuring Lyn Collins, Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, and James Brown), Dead on the Heavy Funk 74-76 (salvaging a total of zero good LPs), or In the Jungle Groove (long-promised, worth-waiting for, full-length, '69-'71 dance classics). Hartman would love every one.

Never hep to his jive, I'm less than shocked by the generalized sentimentality disillusioned admirers descry within these hallowed tracks, though the one about the late great Lowell George (think it's him, any other El Lay rocker die recently?) is unusually rank. I grant that the sincere vocals and rising organ chords do make my heart swell in spite of itself once in a while. But I wonder whether the lost kids (i.e., Lost Kids) in ""Boulevard"" wear mohawks, and whether JB will ever find it in himself to sing to them. Inspirational Line: ""That girl was sane.""

A satire on, celebration of, and lament for the upper-middle classmates an Orange County liberal knows like he knows his neighbor's backyard, the title song is a coup: poignant, droll, political about his own experience rather than some victim's. And dat's dat. Anticlimax: the yearningly Springsteenian--get this title--""For a Rocker.""

Contrary to rumor, this is not an Unjustly Ignored Work of Art. This is a Bad Work of Art. Bruce's music is, yes, well-made, dense and dissonant and throbbing (no one else in rock plays so much bass). But it's designed to support Pete Brown's lyrics, which are, arghh, overwrought, obscure and literary and clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½""I trace your name in spinach""). I know, Brown has been disfiguring Bruce's work since Cream. But at least then he lightened up occasionally. And at least then his bad lyrics functioned mostly as vocal color for the instrumental interaction, whereas here they're enunciated in Bruce's forced art-song style and printed on a special page of the jacket.

Long before Brian Eno hyped ambient, there was the less pretentious term background music, and you can be sure our brave new age will goop up the margin between the two. At his most austere, Eno's old buddy Budd is hyperromantic, and this isn't exactly austere--with the proper inducements (hypnosis, or a large bribe), he might even call it a sellout. Weak-mindedness passing itself off as spirituality--it's what new agers seek in classical music. Budd's angle is to eliminate any vestige of difficulty from the concept.

Burnett is like the Band without self-consciousness--his vocal anguish is really moral, with a sense of history. When he opens with ""We Have All Got a Past"" he's only trying to talk someone into bed, but boy, does that title resonate.

It isn't all as archly mawkish as the rearranged dreamsongs from his group's worst album. Pretentiously dinky is more the prevailing mood--a soundtrack only, like so many arty soundtracks before it. One where Byrne, Meredith Monk, the Kronos Quartet, and some locals who couldn't have known what they were getting into do for Texas what Byrne &amp; Eno did for Africa.
"
FALSE,C+,Rei Momo,David Byrne,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=966,"
Byrne respects and understands distance, an essential faculty in world-beat projects, and his increasingly sinuous singing should make this Latin synthesis a natural. The lyrics are explicitly social without sacrificing the nervous literacy of his established voice. He picks good musicians and provides proper arrangements. And the result is a respectful, highly intelligent dud. Irritating though the muscular masculinity of sonero tradition may be, any doubts as to why it's there are dispelled by Byrne's inability to wrap his weedy chops around salsa that's too tasteful by half. And I'm beginning to suspect he writes rock lyrics--words that can only impact loud, grating, and straight-ahead.

FALSE,C+,Grown Backwards,David Byrne,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12343,"
The two opera selections signify one thing, and it's not that those voice lessons have finally paid off. It's that more even than Randy Newman or Tom Waits (or Sting), this likable Manhattan progressive conceives himself as a performer of artsongs. As a writer of same he has his moments. Somebody somewhere could do justice to the absurdly abject ""Glad"" or the smarmily rationalized ""Empire"" or ""She Only Sleeps,"" the love tribute of a sex worker's boyfriend. Byrne cannot. His voice devoid of Newman-Waits grit, his eclecticism even and controlled where theirs bristles with jokes, oddity, and gusto, how does he expect to connect with anyone but other likable progressives, and rather detached and inscrutable ones at that? The guy's been championing the ordinary since More Songs About Buildings and Food. But he makes such a point of approaching it from the outside you have to wonder whether as far as he's concerned that isn't just more exoticism, which for him is the only thing that comes naturally.

If you have any doubts about needing this handsome $94-list package, you don't. If you're moved to ask pop-friendly me, you don't. Every CD box is larded with marginalia, but the good folks at Revenant--who last year reckoned Charlie Feathers cut 42 ""essential"" tracks between 1954 and 1969--live for it. They believe consumers should share the thrill of digging through the crates, palpitating as the voice of genius emanates from a dusty reel of tape. So instead of winnowing out an hour or so of lost songs, jelled jams, and unjust outtakes, they throw in a 13-minute CD of dim studio chatter, a minute of Don Van Vliet playing the harmonica over the telephone, etc. Take it from pop-friendly me--if you've spent more time with the Captain's free sessions than with Ornette Coleman's, you need to get your priorities in order.

Chapman's voice is even sexier than her looks, she boasts the uncompromising macho ambition of the fanatic rock and roller, and her album is graced with the subtle touches that make fanatic rock and roll come alive. Yet oddly enough it lacks momentum--which I blame not only on producer Al Kooper but on a workaday band and on Chapman's own lingering role confusion. Not one cut sustains. The Bob Seger cover never rocks out, the Hank Williams tribute gets echoed to death, ""I Walk the Line"" is an elegant false start, and the I-was-born-to-rock-and-roll soliloquy is one of the slow songs--as are too many of the others.

So I ask myself: what could be more vulgar than the 20-minute ""Hair Anthology Suite"" that occupies one side of this lp? The answer is nothing, but somehow the old verve is lacking. Spector always excelled at singles, not albums, and that's part of the problem. But it's more than that. Except for the great ""Black Pearl,"" this is too ornate rhythmically, and in this age of super-production the instrumentation doesn't communicate the old outrageousness. Too bad about Phil.

Though a few mediocrities are eliminated and there's a vague chronological rationale (start with the pop stuff kinda and then backtrack kinda), this two-disc repackage could have been programmed by a random-play button.

Having never cracked the r&amp;b top twenty, he made one half decent album for Hi in 1973, and his broad delivery has gained no discernible acuity since. In short, he's a journeyman, and no matter what adoring Japanese innocents think, he's dull and overstated both. I know he's got Hi Rhythm behind him, but would you buy an Eddie Floyd album for Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s--especially with Teenie Hodges taking an endless organ solo?

Seekers after a reggae triumvirate insist that this album is an improvement, which is stretching the truth--the singing's a shade tougher, the writing's a shade sharper, and there are two relatively striking tracks, both of which detail Cliff's paranoia.

In which Cliff rerecords all the great songs he cut originally for Island and A&amp;M--that is, all the great songs he's written, about six total--at a new royalty rate. Always a passionately soulful live performer, he puts a lot into them, but the exigencies of in-concert arrangement take more out, and only ""Viet Nam,"" with its litany of war-torn Third World countries, offers anything radically new. Also new are a cover of Cat Stevens's ""Wild World,"" a singalong movie theme, and a brief sermon about the universal language.

He never gives up, and he never learns from his mistakes, exemplified by the stupefying professionalism with which his authentic JA band negotiates the U.S. pop-funk beats and changes on side one.

Harold Budd records in their studio. The Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir records on their label. I understand that they're more foolish than either (not naive, not after six years), and that they've been known to milk momentary momentum out of electric guitars, but the affinities are there--these faeries are in the aura business. So what are they doing on the alternative rock charts? Ever hear the one about being so open-minded that when you lay down to sleep your brains fall out?

Cohn sings like a sentimental Warren Zevon--an exclusively sentimental Warren Zevon, I mean. He's got some tunes.

I believe good singers (which Cole is) ought to sing good songs.

Before anyone knew she'd go platinum, netcrit Glenn McDonald presciently declared Cole the new queenpin of a female tradition he traced from Kate Bush through Peter Gabriel, Melissa Etheridge, and Sarah McLachlan. Although McDonald sanely declared this genre the obverse of male-identified metal, a skeptic with no tolerance for subpeaks in either would like to note that each is beholden to ""classical"" precepts of musical dexterity and genitalia-to-the-wall expression.

Already a veteran of three bands that meant a great deal to their tiny complement of fans and bubkes to everyone else (Dangerous Birds, Uzi, and Live Skull--how could you forget?), Thalia Zedek is now an established cult heroine. Read her notices and you'll learn that Come is both her song move and her blues move; listen to the music and you'll notice a few flatly projected melodies and some slide guitar. Since her lyrics range from unintelligible to incomprehensible and a groove would be too kind, we're left with a sound--the raw stylization of one woman's alienation. Those who happen to have been captivated by her ""dark,"" ""androgynous"" live shtick can read into this alienation what they will--most likely some parallel to or complement of their own, which is most likely different.

Despite sage advice from my female advisers, I cherished hopes that Coolidge's thick voice--which is grainy rather than gritty, like the Bramlett voice without the bravura--would grow on me the way Tracy Nelson's did. She does get more out of ""Seven Bridges Road"" than Tracy does by underplaying the overstatement just a little, and it's nice to hear ""The Happy Song"" as praise for a househusband.

Jazz-rock goes progressive, by which I mean cool, man. Coryell is himself, by which I mean a chameleon. But Steve Marcus sticks strictly to soprano, and Mike Mandel makes like he doesn't want anybody to know he once played piano in a (shh) rock band.

Too often his pessimism sounds like not just bitterness but spite. He didn't take over the world, and is he mad--not only can't he make the personal political, he can't even make it popular. The Mitchell Froom-produced arrangements here are stuck between Tom Waits as Kurt Weill and Tom Waits as Jackson Browne--Randy Newman is beyond them. So as performed, the good songs are overblown tragedies, the bad ones overblown trifles. The best is the simplest because it's the simplest--""Playboy to a Man,"" love to hear John Hiatt rockabilly it. The most tragic is the chiliastic ""Other Side of Summer,"" recommended to punk bands in the market for a song with a lot of words in it. And I admit ""Invasion Hit Parade"" almost makes the spiteful political. Its theory of life is that fascism has a great deal in common with songs you don't like on the radio.

Tragically but also irritatingly, Dolores O'Riordan indulges all the vices people too stupid for Woody Guthrie or Linton Kwesi Johnson say politics bring out in music: she's strident, moralistic, simple-minded, full of herself. Not only is she shocked to discover that wars are caused by, I would never have guessed, ""political pride"" and ""territorial greed,"" but she thinks she's a better person for telling Tchaikovsky the news.

Clapton, Bruce, and Baker made their money (and names) and ruined their music (and fellowship) in concert. About forty percent of what they released on record during their career was live, so this posthumous product is unnecessary by definition; it's also preferable to the live disc of Wheels of Fire (""Toad"" and ""Spoonful"" are their nadir), if not to the more shapely live cuts on Goodbye. The intensity of side one is unmistakable and attractive, but I'll take Clapton's graceful picking on Fresh Cream's ""Sleepy Time Time"" over the flat-out distortions here--Hendrix has all that amp stuff locked up solid.

Forget the careerist compromise, dazed ennui, and soggy despair, and take this hustle for what it pretends to be and at some level is: four diehard hippies expressing themselves. Poor old guys can't leave politics alone--there's more ecology and militarism here than when they were figureheads of pop revolution, and though the rhetoric is predictable, the impulse has a woozy nobility. Not that that's ever been reason to pay Graham's ditties any mind, or that Stephen's steady-state egotism is redeemed by stray references to judges and changing the world. But while David's cocaine confessional makes ""Almost Cut My Hair"" seem self-abnegating, his ""Nighttime for the Generals"" sure beats Sting. And Neil lends musical muscle and gets commercial muscle back. So, not as horrible as you expected--nor good enough to give a third thought.

No dolt, she figures it's in her best interest to sound like one--as well as an insider outsider like Gush and Bore, whose horrible lessons in playing it safe she takes to heart. ""We got rockstars in the Whitehouse/All our popstars look like porn,"" she whines on the first track, which the ""hit"" tops by claiming, ""I don't have diddly squat,"" while dissing her ""friend the communist"" (who I bet isn't, and I also bet doesn't deserve the putdown). And those are the good songs. Soon here come Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, turns of phrase like ""Lay it like it plays [a little dumb, but OK]/Play it like it lays [wha?]"" and ""With broken wings we'll learn to fly"" and (am I missing some irony here?) ""Life is what happens when you're making plans."" Over this I'd take not the White House (where she'd go in a second if invited politely) but certainly porn (which I note without prejudice she is).

Art-pop is like the dB's and XTC, when a fascination with craft spirals up and in until it turns into an aestheticist obsession. Split Enz was an art-rock band gone pop--sillier, crasser, more full of itself--and Neil Finn's California-based trio dispenses only with the silly. Hooks you can buy anywhere these days, and for directness you might as well apply straight to Bruce Hornsby--beyond the occasional hint of guitar anarchy, this is product for sure.

With the transmutation of junk a species of junk itself, an evasion available to any charlatan or nincompoop, it's tempting to ignore this patent arena move altogether. But by pumping his bad faith and bad relationship into depressing moderato play-loud keyb anthems far more tedious than his endless vamps, Robert Smith does actually confront a life contradiction. Not the splintered relationship, needless to say, although the title tune is a suitably grotesque breakup song among unsuitably grotesque breakup songs. As with so many stars, even ""private"" ones who make a big deal of their ""integrity,"" Smith's demon lover is his audience, now somehow swollen well beyond his ability to comprehend, much less control. Hence the huge scale of these gothic cliches. And watch out, you mass, 'cause if you don't accept this propitiation he just may start contemplating suicide again. Or take his money and go home.

Maybe they're SoundScan scammers like Vince Gill and Skid Row, reaping unwarranted cred from a revamped accounting system. Or maybe they're cool alternatives like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, poised to prove the sales appeal of self-dramatizing pessimism. Maybe they're even riding the actual-hit ""Friday I'm in Love,"" which actually sounds cheerful, though by Sunday it's over, actually. In any case, let it be noted that these new wave survivors, a specialized taste of undiscriminating undergraduates for years, have just now scored their biggest album ever, a redolent 13 years after they didn't actually kill that Arab. I ask you, where were the Moody Blues after 13 years? (Riding their second--and final--No. 1 album, since you didn't know.)

With Cyrus oversinging like Michael Bolton at a Perot rally, this album revolted me well before I got to its climactic title cut, about how brave guys help their fellow man by killing other men, presumably not fellow and most likely gooks or something. Only it turns out Michael Bolton was on the same side as Michael Stipe, and it also turns out that Cyrus manages a nice macho self-mockery on both his hit and the likes of ""Wher'm I Gonna Live?"" and ""I'm So Miserable."" Give him a few years of ups and downs and he could be the 21st-century Waylon Jennings. Can't wait, can you?

Dissing women is nothing. Any fool can dis women, educated fools included.

Serves him well in the business world, of course--nothing threatening about snide, goes with Hurby Luv Bug's beats. But there are less retrograde (and funnier) ways for rap to go pop.

Just like some ambivalent bloggerati--though for me the process involved historical research rather than a fond reminisce down my hard drive's memory lane--I prefer this fussy little succes d'estime's avant period. But not, of course, because I equate muso experiment with Good and pop accommodation with Evil. It's for the very reason their admirers proffer their forgiveness--the accommodation is half-assed, clumsy. These are ""rock songs"" in Ned Rorem's dreams--they're as ornate as a high-class geisha house. And where formerly Satomi Matsuzaki's Shonen-Knife-goes-to-college was a precious abrasion melded into strange background music you could ignore at will, here we're expected to ponder what she might Mean.

Five years ago, Denny sang lead with the progenitors of English folk-rock, Fairport Convention. Soon, however, she left-to-pursue-her-own-career. The group remained interesting enough to hold a following, but never broke through artistically or commercially, and although credible observers believed Denny had the stuff to become one of the finest women singers in the world, she didn't. One four-minute masterpiece on this otherwise sluggish album--the opening cut, written by Denny, called ""Solo""--deals obliquely with these losses. Now one hears that Fairport and Denny are regrouping. And so are Steppenwolf and John Kay.

Singer-songwriter folk fault Denver for his simple-minded escapism, implying a preference for subtle escapism in the manner of James &amp; Carly. But if escapism is the context maybe Denver's transparency is a (small) virtue. Good wholesome product, no falser (or true) than the run of the competition, tuneful and chaste with flatness for that common touch. Maybe the folk are offended because he sold four million albums in six months.

""New Life"" is worthy of Eno at his most rhapsodically technopastoral, but most of this tuneful pap crosses Meco (without the humble functionalism), Gary Numan (without the devotion to surface), and Kraftwerk (without the humor--oh, definitely without the humor). You'd think after seventy-five years people would have seen through the futurist fallacy--an infatuation with machinery is the ultimate one-sided love affair.

This is a monstrous record. The ""rock"" star who broke the Broadway barrier seems to be thinking Big Musical, in the urban sentimental mode (complete with Evil, of course) that does such small justice to the challenge of New York. Although fellow urban sentimentalist Robbie Robertson can achieve an awesome (almost fulsome) fullness with rock instrumentation, his production is basically pop program music. Yet somewhere in my cockles I found Diamond hooking me as I listened for the last time and I had to admit that it takes a special kind of chutzpah to create a monster.

On the other hand, how good can a Bo Diddley record be? Unlike Chuck Berry, who must also transcend a certain musical homogeneity, Bo hasn't written a whole songbook of great lyrics, and anyway, his homogeneity is a lot more homogeneous than Chuck's.

If any up-and-coming rock-and-roller aspires to auteur status it's Mark Knopfler, and among those with a taste for his rather corny plots (Romeo and Juliet, fancy that) this establishes his claim. Me, I note that this third album closes with his second gay-baiting song, and that I wasn't surprised . Better he should work on somebody else's stories--his guitar has emerged from Eric Clapton's shadow into a jazzy rock that muscles right past Larry Carlton and ilk. Steely Straits, anyone? Or would that be Dire Dan?

I admit that Mark Knopfler is a classy enough guitarist and producer to entice me into his nostalgic obsessions: at its best ""Telegraph Road"" sounds like supernal Mark-Almond, and the cheesy organ on ""Industrial Disease"" betrays a sense of humor. But the portentous arrangements on the other three cuts (right, that makes five, mean length 8:24) suggest nothing so much as ELP with blues roots. And Knopfler's sarcastic impression of a Harley Street M.D. on the very same ""Industrial Disease"" leaves no doubt that even his sense of humor is pompous.

Disinclined though I am to blame music on engineering, I reluctantly decided that what ailed this five-years-awaited fourth album wasn't just uncharacteristically inelegant arrangements and lyrics unworthy of Stony Browder but a fuzzy, cavernous mix that at times turned Cory Daye into another background element. Then I remembered that I'd gotten an advance last spring, and when I compared the two I was shocked. Remix engineers Gary Hellman and Rob Paustian--abetted I'm sure by schlock svengali Sandy Linzer and possibly Browder, credited with coproducing the new version--have ruined a crisp, spare, inelegant-on-purpose rock and roll album, smothering a great singer in artificial fog along the way. They've also deleted two songs, each strong enough to lead a side of the advance, neither (hmm) produced by Linzer. And you know what else? The little subhead that says ""featuring Cory Daye"" on the original cover is gone as well. Docked a notch or two to encourage boycott.

FALSE,C+,The Chronic,Dr. Dre,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1089,"
The crucial innovation of this benchmark album isn't its conscienceless naturalization of casual violence. It's Dre's escape from sampling. Other rappers, as they are called, have promised to create their own musical environments, usually without revealing how much art and how much publishing fuels their creative resolve. But Dre is the first to make the fantasy pay out big-time. The world he hears in his head isn't the up-to-date P-Funk fools say they hear--that would be too hard. Instead he lays bassline readymades under simulations of Bernie Worrell's high keyb sustain, a basically irritating sound that in context always signified fantasy, not reality--stoned self-loss or, at a best Dre never approaches, grandiose jive. This is bell-bottoms-and-Afros music, its spiritual source the blaxploitation soundtrack, and what it promises above all is boom times for third-rate flautists--sociopathic easy-listening. Even if it's ""just pop music,"" as some rationalize, it's bad pop music.

Dolby is a bright and honest fellow by no means in thrall to his synthesizers. ""She Blinded Me With Science"" proved he knows his way around a good beat, and the lyric sheet bespeaks a level of literacy rarely achieved by songwriters. But as with so many artists fascinated by synthesizers (and more than a few beguiled by their own literacy), his passion for texture subsumes what small knack he has for cruder, more linear devices. If there's an objective correlative for boring, that's it.

Anyone can sing rock, but that doesn't mean just anyone. Richard Nixon can't, and neither can Barbra Streisand, and I bet Peter Fonda can't either. Well, neither can Ray Manzarek or Robbie Krieger, whose voices share one salient quality: uptightness. This record has some terrific moments, starting with the first hook riff, and the musicians deserve their reputations. But even a good singer couldn't do much with a line like ""To roam is my infection,"" and this band could use a good singer.

Lazing around in Warren G's groove without making a pass at his tragic sense of life, these arrogant hangers-on would be yawns if they weren't the ugliest sexists to make a three week splash all year. Although the hatred is everywhere, it's most painful on an early ""skit""-song-""skit"" triptych: ""The Train"" (a backslapper about gang rape in the dark),""Fuck Ya Mouth"" (""To all our hookers and hoes""), and ""Slap a Hoe"" (a device invented for punks too yellow to do the job themselves). Heaven forfend the rappers actually doing any of these things, except maybe buy a Slap-a-Hoe--this isn't advocacy, it's constitutionally protected representation, harrumph. What I don't understand is why anyone who doesn't hate women is outraged when C. Delores Tucker goes just as far overboard in response. If they understand when self-serving black men express themselves in these, harrumph, metaphors, why don't they understand when self-serving black women counterattack by any means necessary?

As public figures and maybe as people, these imperialist wimps are the most deplorable pop stars of the postpunk if not post-Presley era. Their lyrics are obtuse at best, and if you'd sooner listen to a machine sing than Simon Le Bon, what are you going to do with both? Yet the hit singles which lead off each side are twice as pleasurable as anything Thomas Dolby is synthesizing these days. Which had better teach you something about imperialism.

Jon Landau wrote to suggest I give this a D, but that's pique. Conceptually, this is a brilliant album which is organized, I think, by two central ideas. First that ""self"" is most accurately defined (and depicted) in terms of the artifacts--in this case pop tunes and folk songs claimed as personal property and semispontaneous renderings of past creations frozen for posterity on a piece of tape and (perhaps) even a couple of songs one has written oneself--to which one responds.  Second, that the people's music is the music people like, Mantovani strings and all. But in order for a concept to work it has to be supported musically--that is, you have to listen. I don't know anyone, even vociferous supporters of this album, who plays more than one side at a time. I don't listen to it at all . The singing is not consistently good, though it has its moments, and the production--for which I blame Bob Johnston, though Dylan has to be listed as a coconspirator--ranges from indifferent to awful. It is possible to use strings and soprano choruses well, but Johnston has never demonstrated the knack. Other points: it's overpriced, the cover art is lousy, and it sounds good on WMCA.

Where Self-Portrait was at least weird, splitting the difference between horrible and hilarious, now he's forever professional--not a single remake honors or desecrates the original. All he can do to a song is Dylanize it, and thus his Danny Kortchmar band and his Steve Jones-Paul Simonon band are indistinguishable, immersed in that patented and by now meaningless one-take sound. And yet, and yet, there's a glimmer--the Dylan-Hunter throwaway ""Ugliest Girl in the World,"" guaranteed to remind the faithful how much fun the one-take ethos used to be.

Put on your neckboots and wade through the slickshit and you may get a kick from the lyrics--these boys like lotsa malaise with their mayonnaise.

Not as country-rocky as you might expect--the Eagles are pros who adapt to the times, and they make the music tough. I actually enjoy maybe half of these songs until I come into contact with the conceited, sentimental woman-haters who are doing the singing. I mean, these guys think punks are cynical and antilife?

This postsoul big band isn't as messy as the sum of its cross-references; on the second side especially, the heavy guitar, post-Memphis horns, and off-center 4/4 all work to similarly disquieting effect, and even the African kalimba is suitably weird. But at times the brass locks into gear just like Vegas, and the expert vocal harmonies neither fit the concept nor assert any personality of their own.

Leaping from mediocrity to wretched excess, they throw two discs on the market when they don't have the material for one. The lead cut/single, ""Let Me Talk,"" is too political in its fluffy way to break down the racism to today's top 40, and after that they never top the Doobies rip on side three--certainly not with the title number, which I blame on the fools who think they abandoned their principles when they gave up ersatz jazz.

They could use one--the three r&amp;b hits are set apart only by Barbara Roy's vibrato-tinged soul shouting.

Denying prior knowledge of Joy Division, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and Interpol, Staffordshire University's answer to the Arctic Monkeys cite as influences early R.E.M., Elbow, and the French Doors--not Jimbo in Paris, a Brooklyn band that shares members with, you know, Black Lipstick. I believe them, too. Though this strain of heartsick gravity was unknown on earth before Ian Curtis and the goth/new romantic inundation he heralded, it has since been imprinted on every Caucasian adolescent in the English-speaking world. And as leader Tom Smith demonstrates, it needn't be morbid or suicidal. His message is often sanely chin-up--as in ""Open your arms and welcome people to your town"" and even the relatively dark (if sonically comic) ""You don't need this disease you don't,"" 36 repetitions of which constitute virtually the entire lyric of ""Bullets.""

Roy Wood's departure leaves Jeff Lynne to re-create this band in his own image: a conventional art-rocker less ponderous and more long-winded than previously indicated, with an uncommonly lyrical side and his own sense of humor.

I like the way ""Mongoose"" grafts polyrhythms onto hard rock, and I'm pleased that they utter the word ""revolution"" with some notion of what it means.

I have no theoretical objection to the man's hard rock move--it's the dumb-ass conventionality of the actual hard rock in question that gives me a pain. Where Lloyd Maines and Ponty Bone were aces on their country-identified instruments, Ely's new guys are arena dorks in their dreams. You remember the tunes and licks after a while only because they're so similar to thousands of others you soon forgot. And where Ely's own songs have always worked best as change-of-pace, here they're expected to carry the shebang. Except for the febrile ""Imagine Houston,"" buried on side two, and maybe ""Cool Rockin' Loretta,"" a find of a throwaway but no more, they sink it instead.

Once they were winning wannabees stealing pop hooks in the basement.

Ugly as the Geto Boys and a lot dumber, the cross-dressing tale ""Jane 3"" climaxes with the rape she deserves; elsewhere the rhymes run three bozacks and three criminal-mindeds to one Mandela/Farrakhan.

""A bold new beginning,"" proclaims the sticker, and given their late-'80s sales it had better be, so essentially they go pop--rather than ""ironic"" new-wave metapop, a distinction that escaped every Tom Petty type who made Dave Stewart his new-waver of choice. Despite a few fabulous Elvis similes, this bold stroke is sorely lacking in je-ne-sais-quoi.

They're singing as good as ever, but not the same as ever--with the harmonies more luxurious and soulful, they can finally pass for grown men as they approach fifty. Unfortunately, maturity doesn't suit them any better than Dave Edmunds's lacquered, interpretation-enhancing production, because mature interpretation will never be their forte. They may sound like grown men and they may sound soulful, but that doesn't mean they sound like soulful grown men--a certain emotional complexity eludes them. Of all these hand-tailored comeback-special songs, only Paul Kennerly's ""The First in Line"" and Don's own ""Asleep"" are simple enough to fit.

It's a little disorienting to encounter a dance music that lives or dies aesthetically by its lyrics--partying's not supposed to be that way. Yet here it is. Back when Winston Henry was a struggling young soca man, he came by his sobriquet honestly; these days he doesn't miss a chance to kiss Reagan's ass or make like ""our skin color not get in our way."" As a result (?), his groove gets nowhere. Interesting that back when he was a struggling young soca man his ""Lorraine"" sported as ferocious a hook as the style has known, while now his pop moves are reduced to a certain slackening of the tempo and the occasional keyb texture.

""My category is alternative, period,"" avers the last intelligent person to make such a claim in this millennium. He doesn't want to be folk or New Age, and who can blame him? But if he were, some rich dunderhead might insist that he treat blues and pop rarities to his dolorously deliberate touch, like on those old Reprise albums Byron Coley sneers at. Instead he's encouraged to stagger toward an obscure destination mere mortals would noodle around, dumbfounding bystanders with the scraps of sound that flake off his beard as he goes. Once in a while tunes poke through the refuse, notably that of ""Chelsey Silver, PleaseCall Home."" These occasion proud huzzahs from young fools who can only forgive themselves such emoluments after a good cleansing scourge of spare solo indirection.

Back before they were musicians--before they played riffs requiring digital articulation and sang the occasional backup or even response--they tossed off live product all the time. The formula was simple--Mark E. harangued and the band crashed and droned. No atmospheric gunk like ""Mollusc in Tyrol"" or incompetent covers like ""Pinball Machine"" and, yes, ""Victoria,"" which in the great tradition of bad live albums betrays its studio version. ""Mollusc in Tyrol"" and ""Pinball Machine,"" God help us, are studio versions.

Stuck between pretentious young purists who believe catchy love songs betray their hardcore heritage and eager younger fans who believe catchy love songs fulfill their teenthrob destiny, these Warped Tour cover boys aren't terrible, but are they ever ordinary. Only their record company would claim that emotional vocals, dramatic dynamics, poppy-punky tempos, and not actually all that catchy tunes add up to ""their own sound.""

Since the singing makes Rex Harrison sound like Mario Lanza, it's tuneful in only the most abstract sense. (Already the fanzines are paying attention.) Without the usual vocal surges it's also quite static. (Veddy interesting.) What hooks there are inhere in the chord changes. (Sounds more like art all the time.)

But the more I listen the more irrelevant that seems--when you crave a little authenticity, you don't go to a cute factory for it. What they need is more stringent quality controls than they're likely to get from chief producer Robin Halpin--not to mention the bozos who captain the ill-conceived Fat Boys excursion, or even ""Tender Love""'s Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who've never made balladry their long suit.

He's a singer who's more interested in impressing the deacons (and their wives) than feeling the spirit--overripe, self-involved, and in the end pretentious. And this material is far from his best--stuck with the low-grade rock gentility of ""Walk Away Renee"" and ""If I Were a Carpenter"" and the sermonizing of ""What Is Man"" and ""In These Changing Times,"" he's a typical victim of Motown's decadence. Despite some good rhythm tracks--they always seem to get good rhythm tracks out there--the only one of these songs you'll remember fondly is ""Just Seven Numbers,"" a simple-minded throwaway about swallowing your pride and making that call.

I overlooked it on Maggot Brain because the music was so difficult to resist, but here the strings (told you about their taste in white people), long-windedness (another double-LP that should be a single), and programmatic lyrics (""Miss Lucifer's Love"" inspires me to mention that while satanism is a great antinomian metaphor it often leads to murder, rape, etc.) leave me free to exercise my prejudices.

If Gabriel can't resist orchestrating his rock and roll, better he should lay on third-world rhythms than simulate first-world themes. But self-conscious primitivism hasn't cured his grandiosity--lyrical protestations notwithstanding, the only time those rhythms are around him and inside him, in control and in his soul, is on ""Shock the Monkey,"" which has a good old first-world hook. Only Gabriel probably doesn't want to be cured--bet he admires African music not because it flows like a stream but because it taps the divine, and while he may know in his head that animists can't have one without the other, he's not about to become a believer.

FALSE,C+,Cats Under the Stars,Jerry Garcia,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6884,"
There seem to be three good songs here until you listen to the lyric of ""Rubin and Cherise."" The other two, ""Cats Under the Stars"" and ""Rhapsody in Red,"" are both about music. Come to think of it, so is ""Rubin and Cherise.""
"
FALSE,C+,Live,Marvin Gaye,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6887,"
There's inspired singing here, but even on the stupendous version of ""Trouble Man"" Gene Page's orchestra intrudes--Gaye hasn't managed to mix the instruments into the unified background presence of his recent studio albums. Also: seven great oldies banished to a ""Fossil Medley,"" and ""Jan,"" conceivably the worst song he's ever written.
"
FALSE,C+,I Want You,Marvin Gaye,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6888,"
This isn't as disgraceful as would first appear--as disco-identified mood mewzick for light necking it offers nifty engineering, pleasant harmonies, and the occasional snatch of melody. But as a Marvin Gaye record it's a Leon Ware record. Ware is the producer who cowrote every one of these . . . tunes? segments? . . . cuts (which is more than Marvin can claim). But was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it.
"
FALSE,C+,Dream of a Lifetime,Marvin Gaye,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4858,"
Like a lot of rock and roll geniuses, Gaye was also a nut (or jerk, if you prefer). One reason he worked so assiduously in the studio was that he was loath to let us see all the way inside him, which means that these posthumously consummated outtakes and private jokes are by his own best standard too unmediated to carry much aesthetic weight. By my own best standards, too. On ""Ain't It Funny (How Things Turn Around),"" the only track that bears Gaye's rhythmic and harmonic signature rather than Gordon Banks's or Harvey Fuqua's schlock-it-to-'em, and ""Savage in the Sack,"" a joke he knew enough to find funny, his wit and charm shine through. Elsewhere he's just letting off guilt in heavenly visions or sexual fantasies out of control. Maybe bondage freaks will find ""Masochistic Beauty"" a turn-on--what do I know? I know what I infer from ""Sanctified Lady"" (formerly ""Sanctified Pussy"")--that this man found himself despising women for doing the kinky things he forced them to do. And there's no way that's a turn-on.

FALSE,C+,Romantically Yours,Marvin Gaye,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4859,"
The sad testament of a tormented weirdo who longed to redeem himself in the world of middle-class convention. On side one he covers ""standards"" that are beneath him (""More""), beyond him (""Fly Me to the Moon""), or beside the point (""Maria""). On side two he attempts to write his own. The singing isn't bad--was it ever? The strings are godawful.

FALSE,C+,Bloodshot,The J. Geils Band,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6895,"
Never has the mass audience blunted a group's fine points so quickly. Tight arrangements? They boogie endlessly through riffs they were playing three years ago. Low-profile funk? Peter Wolf now shows off every emotional inadequacy of his phony growl. Resourceful material? The borrowed songs are almost as bad as the originals.  Humor? Their idea of a funny is to rhyme""shiny"" and ""heinie."" I hope they know where to shine this one.

FALSE,C+,Love Stinks,The J. Geils Band,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4861,"
So it's broad--nothing wrong with broad. Just ask the uproarious single and title tune. But really, the rest is more overbearing white r&amp;b--Seth Justman's organ blams, not to mention his furbelows on the endless-at-3:35 ""Desire,"" are the work of a man who thinks ""No Anchovies, Please"" is funny.

For a while I was tempted to buzz Phil Collins over his former fearless leader. He's a warmer singer, God help them both, and the formerly useless Tony Banks proves adept with the keyb hooks. But in the end I couldn't tolerate the generalization density--not just of the lyrics (where Peter Gabriel's personal and geopolitical details offer some evidence that he's been there) but of the hooks, which end up feeling coercive, an effect unmitigated by Collins's whomping instrumental technique. And just to prove they're still Genesis, we get solos.

FALSE,C+,Thanks I'll Eat It Here,Lowell George,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6907,"
You are of course familiar with the recording industry phenomenon in which a vocalist enters the studio (or many studios) with a few (or many) well-regarded musicians and they all ""cut"" between eight and eleven songs written by the vocalist, the vocalist's friends, and some lucky black people. Here the smartest member of Little Feat does this. Unfortunately, singing has never been his strong point, and the compositions are as flaccid as any he's ever made public. Or maybe it only sounds that way because we're used to hearing him atop Little Feat's contradictory funk, not the obliging groove well-regarded musicians usually achieve under such circumstances.

FALSE,C+,Obituary,George Gerdes,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6908,"
Gerdes casts his jaundiced larynx upon foibles cultural and countercultural as well as the usual romantic reverses. Very waggish.

FALSE,C+,Out of the Blue,Debbie Gibson,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8237,"
People think there's something cute about this schemer, but I ask you--is it really possible to be a self-made millionaire and the girl next door simultaneously? I'll take a Harvard M.B.A. any day. Paul Anka wrote his own songs too, and he had more of a flair for language. As for beats, well, I'm not going to argue with ""Only in My Dreams"" or ""Shake Your Love."" But the one she produced by herself is a flat-out dog.

FALSE,C+,Electric Youth,Debbie Gibson,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6087,"
Casting about for a clue to this cipher, I found a gem in the bio: ""My mom and dad took me to literally thousands of auditions, lessons, and performances."" Making her a showbiz kid manque who immersed her perfect pitch and competitive Chopin in disco and Billy Joel, with every pop dream supported by doting parents who didn't want to raise a rebel and got their wish--so far. Unable to fall back on even an alienated childhood for inspiration, her music is synthesis without thesis or antithesis. A mimic and nothing more, she emits banalities about relationships and life choices that are no doubt deeper than anything she's actually experienced--so far.
"
FALSE,C+,I Still Believe in You,Vince Gill,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4124,"
As bland as Nicolette Fogelberg, with Tony Brown running the broad-spectrum lyrics through his good-taste machine as if he wants to be Peter Asher when he grows up, Gill is the real country-hunk menace because he's so reproducible. I admit they pin a few classics--""Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away"" and ""Say Hello"" have the ring of general truth. But when they don't, it's '70s singer-songwriter all over again. Eddie Rabbitt just didn't know how to market himself.
"
FALSE,C+,Gilley's Greatest Hits Vol. 1,Mickey Gilley,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6913,"
Gilley is Jerry Lee Lewis's cousin and reputed imitator. He's also proprietor of the largest country-music club in the known world. But his semi-mythic stature is unjustified. His piano arpeggios never get mean. His voice lacks all of Jerry Lee's shrill urgency--more like Jim Reeves with a (certain) sense of rhythm, or Bob Luman without the bite, or maybe even Perry Como Arkansas-born and Houston-raised. And his taste is mainstream country at best. If you like songs with roses in them--three of the ten here qualify--you'll enjoy this more than I do. But expect no rock and roll nor rockabilly nor any but the tamest honky-tonk.

FALSE,C+,New Miserable Experience,Gin Blossoms,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5903,"
Even if you hate weak guys a lot more than I do, you can't deny that ""Hey Jealousy"" is a classic--Peter Buck himself would kill (or at least steal) for that gold-plated guitar hook. But though the guy who came up with it is now dead, the group and its handlers jangle on through mediocre follow-ups programmers wouldn't have played twice before ""Hey Jealousy"" softened them up. Released in 1992, the album is now double platinum, on the charts a year and a half after it broke. And I wouldn't put it past them to sell the next one too. The marketplace--what mere journalist can fathom it?
"
FALSE,C+,Songs From Liquid Days,Philip Glass,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4865,"
From Satyagraha to Mishima, much of Glass's recent work has invoked the mood if not the methods of nineteenth-century classical music, a realm of discourse where I'm reluctant to pass judgment, though I will mention that this hardly makes him unique among soundtrack composers. When it comes to vocal production, though, I have my proud prejudices. Without passing judgment on Satyagraha's Douglas Perry, who applies his tenor to one song here, I'll insist without fear of ignorance that he's a less than apt model for the Roches and Bernard Fowler (Linda Ronstadt can do what she wants). Even Suzanne Vega's lyrics read better than they sound. Which may just mean Glass is too spiritually enlightened to set meaningful texts to music.

""We're everything your parents ever warned you about,"" they warn. ""We can't feel nothin', got no heart or soul,"" they boast. ""The Godz are rock and roll machines,"" they admit.

FALSE,C+,Moontan,Golden Earring,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6918,"
The single off this, ""Radar Love,"" was voted best of 1973 in England but ran out of radio detecting and ranging waves in this country, which made Grand Funk's ""The Loco-Motion"" number one instead. Yah, yah, our stupid-rock is better than your stupid-rock--especially when yours comes from Holland.

FALSE,C+,Timeless,Goldie,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1416,"
If Goldie is to jungle what Tricky is to trip hop--the ""accessible"" name brand for strangers in wonderland--then Martin Denny was Dr. Livingston. Occasionally some diva takes up a tune, but mainly this pleasant, far from arrhythmic soundspace posits an impressionistic respite from hardcore techno, with warm links to fusion, movie music, and the tragically neglected legacy of Rick Wakeman.

FALSE,C+,The Chronicles of Life and Death,Good Charlotte,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12592,"
Like a thousand hit bands before them, they've seen the great big world and feel wiser, and like a thousand hit bands before them, they've forgotten the wisdom--strike that, the knowledge--that made them a hit to begin with. Beyond some rich-and-famous irony, not a single suburban detail soils an hour of good intentions. And you know the music overreaches too.
"
FALSE,C+,Bad Boy,Robert Gordon,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4878,"
As our increased familiarity and his increased facility reduce his dependence on ironic context, he becomes unnecessary--totally unnecessary, I mean. Sure he uses his excellent voice better than genre loyalists give him credit for. But that makes him either a ""real"" rockabilly or an interpreter with moldy-fig tastes--competition for either Ray Campi or Roomful of Blues. I mean, like wow. He was more interesting, and more emotionally effective, as a joke with no punch line.
"
FALSE,C+,Fresh Fish Special,Robert Gordon With Link Wray,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6924,"
Gordon has perfected his craft since cutting his first album, and the follow-up is less lively as a result, because the heroic stance he's homed in on is rockabilly balladeer, which is a lot harder to approximate than '50s rock and roller. After all, the credulous lucidity of Presley's slow songs is beyond mortal imitation, and how much secondhand early Twitty (or Husky) does anyone need?

FALSE,C+,Movement,The Gossip,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11939,"
A fat sexy lesbian teenager whose entire trio escaped Arkansas for Olympia? A big voice with its emotions out front? What's not to love? Nothing, declare gossipmongers bowled over by their strenuous gigs. To which well-wishers must inquire, Er, how about music? Beth Ditto gives no indication she could sing the tunes that aren't here. Brace Howdeshall applies punk chops to a soul concept. Kathy Mendonca doesn't know what an offbeat is.

What's happening to me? Maybe it's that damned billboard. Or maybe I'm beginning to appreciate--I said appreciate--their straight-ahead celebration of beat, amplification, and youthful camaraderie. After all, rock and roll has always been loud, and its rhythms have always been described as ""heavy."" And at least Mark Farner doesn't pretend to bluesmanship.

FALSE,C+,They Said It Couldn't Be Done,Grandmaster Flash,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4882,"
I was and am rooting for Flash, Creole, and Rahiem--they have good hearts, and from the Fats Waller cover and the way ""Iko Iko"" sneaks scratch-style into the lead cut, you can tell they're trying. But Creole isn't powerful enough for a lead rapper, Rahiem's crooning is wimp ordinaire without bombast for ballast, and sometime Herbie Hancock vocalist Gavin Christopher not only isn't anywhere near as funky as the Sugarhill gang (which I assume everyone knows) but has none of the pop production flair that might move them into Rick James territory, assuming that's even a desirable destination any more. And the words! ""Sign of the Times"" is the kind of confused protest you could hear on sucker twelve-inches a year ago, ""Jailbait"" isn't so fucking good-hearted, and ""Girls Love the Way He Spins"" is the claim that's supposed to make the competition hang up their mikes and go home. Why do groups break up? It's enough to make you lose your faith in capitalism.

FALSE,C+,On the Strength,Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4884,"
Like a big band that costs too much to put on the road, their fluid five-man rat-a-tat-tat is a throwback to a more innocent era; their attempts to keep up--their ""boyee""s, their samples, their Steppenwolf cameo--are depressingly flat. And despite an amazing ""I have a dream"" cover, Mele-Mel's return doesn't do all that much for their moral fervor. A ""Gold"" worthy of the subject wouldn't slip past miners and murders on its way to the IDs, and to hear onetime love man Rahiem make pimp jokes is to wonder just how he'll get by after their next label drops them.
"
FALSE,C+,Going for Broke,Eddy Grant,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1128,"
Though it pains me to put it in black and white, Grant is half hack, and pop gambles are by their very nature never as all-or-nothing as his brave title pretends. The dance cuts don't walk on sunshine, the rockers sow no special feel for that beat, and as a ballad singer he's such a born belter it's amazing he brings off even the charming ""Blue Wave.""

FALSE,C+,Mighty Joe Moon,Grant Lee Buffalo,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5904,"
Grant Lee Phillips doesn't sing subtly enough to pine so lyrically or forcefully enough to suffer so unremittingly. That folkloric drawl may be the way he talks, but it sounds like he picked it up at the movies along with the rest of his ideas. It's pointless to suggest he stick in a few laughs because there's no chance they'll be funny. I do recommend, however, that he abandon his quest for the meaning of John Wayne Gacy.

Despite the hooks, highlighted unnaturally by do-or-die production, this is definitely the Dead, not Journey or Starship. But only ""When Push Comes to Shove,"" a ruminative catalogue of paranoid images that add up to one middle-aged man's fear of love, shows up the young ignorami and old fools who've lambasted them as symbols of hippie complacency since the '60s were over. One problem with the cosmic is that it doesn't last forever.

Can these be the same guys who backed Joe Cocker? From producer and pseudonymous pianist Chris Stainton I expected better--but not, I guess, from vocalist-composer (formerly just guitarist) Henry McCullough. The Band gets away with putting a nonsinger up front by shuffling five of them, and all five nonsing with more passion and style than Henry.

Tompall Glaser's slurred, soft-focus baritone might grow on me, I suppose, but as of now he's one more singing legend I'd rather hear about than hear. A touch too sentimental, a touch too nasty underneath, and whether he's playing Stills to Waylon's Young or Nash to Waylon's Crosby, it's all sour goop to me.

FALSE,C+,American Idiot,Green Day,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12713,"
If you're wondering what this concept album means, don't labor over the lyric booklet. As Billie Joe knows even if he doesn't come out and say it--he doesn't come out and say lots of obvious stuff--this is a visual culture. So examine the cover. That red grenade in the upraised fist? It's also a heart--a bleeding heart. Which he heaves as if it'll explode, only it won't, because he doesn't have what it takes to pull the pin. The emotional travails of two clueless punks--one passive, one aggressive, both projections of the auteur--stand in for the sociopolitical content that the vague references to Bush, Schwarzenegger, and war (not any special war, just war) are thought to indicate. There's no economics, no race, hardly any compassion. Joe name-checks America as if his hometown of Berkeley was in the middle of it, then name-checks Jesus as if he's never met anyone who's attended church. And to lend his maunderings rock grandeur, he ties them together with devices that sunk under their own weight back when the Who invented them. Sole rhetorical coup: makes being called a ""faggot"" something to aspire to, which in this terrible time it is.

Nomenclature niggle: not ""chamber pop."" Serving up two kinds of genteel escape, pastoral and aesthetic, this is chamber folk-rock--or, less kindly, folk-prog. From the Beach Boys on down, chamber pop is about tune and hook embellishment. These guys are in it for the atmosphere. There are vaguer lyrics out there, but the reason the band's claque is gaga for the line ""We'll swim around like two dories"" isn't how evocative the image is (it isn't, which should count for something), but the extra squeeze of choirboy tight-ass Daniel Rossen pretties it up with. Applied to the straightforward ""Deep Blue Sea"" on Dark Was the Night, their skilled playing remains modest enough, but on this subtler and more pretentious material, the skills predominate, and just in case they don't, let's add a string quartet here and real choirboys there. Plus, they still hum. Less than last time, but a lot.

I prefer this hunky purveyor of semiclassical ear massage to his polar coordinates, John Raitt and Andrea Bocelli--lacking the voice of either, he rarely shows off, and the ease is a relief.

Sick of going into debt to make exquisitely conceived studio albums that don't sell, Arlo here delivers a mostly live LP--with undistinguished  folkie-rockie added by his road band, Shenandoah--that strings together pointless Elvis and Beatles covers, one-dimensional folk songs, and a tall tale that would have trouble making first string guard on a high school basketball team.

Hagen is one of those Yurrupean artistes who consent to perform ""rock"" because it's vunderful theater. Big of her with her operatic training and all, dontcha think? And she does have a new-wave sense of humor--instead of taking on Maria Callas with her umpteen-octave range she does impressions of Linda Blair and Mercedes McCambridge. Unfortunately for those of us who believe rock is vunderful songs, her drama transcends the form. The exception is the scary antiheroin minidrama ""Smack Jack.""

Four country hits on Haggard's first straight studio album in a year and a half, but only the simple goodbye song ""I Can't Be Myself"" escapes bathos. ""The Farmer's Daughter,"" ""I'm a Good Loser,"" and ""I've Done It All"" have an acceptably archetypal ring. Forget the rest--Hag already has.

Country legend or no, Haggard has no more business doing an album about broken relationships than Public Image Ltd. As a result, material that might be touching from a more austere singer is barely credible, and the three songs that open side two--one by Merle and Jimmy Dickens, one by Merle's off-and-on wife Leona Williams, and one by the austere Willie Nelson--ooze with the kind of moist self-pity ordinarily encountered only in leaders of the men's liberation movement.

It wouldn't be strictly accurate to claim Haggard has pissed his talent away, but the temptation to say so anyhow beckons. His laid-back vocal signature is the lazy man's friend. His originals suggest that he has no reject pile--just entunes any old piece of verse for the annual session. And again and again his famous ecumenicism camouflages lame genre excursions--on this album, the Bellamy-reggae ""Sea of Heartbreak."" A slight improvement over 1988's feckless Out Among the Stars, due mostly to a formulaic title tune Hag didn't write. But if he thinks he isn't getting away with shit, he needs a shrink.

Beloved of their art therapist, their parents, Lester Bangs, and whoever owns Armageddon, Jad and David Fair's boxed three-record set is enriched with a poster, a (truncated) lyric sheet, and a one-pic-per-thick-red-page comic entitled ""Becky the Monkey."" Most of the budget went into the display--the sound suits the one-take learning-our-chords musicianship and vocals that make Jonathan Richman sound like Vaughan Monroe. Originals usually concern girls and sometimes mention artists; covers include ""Funky Broadway,"" ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" and ""She's Cracked."" Also included are several lengthy instrumental experiments and a live disc. Won't these superstars ever learn to boil their self-indulgences down into one tight, well-selected album?

It wasn't inevitable that the return to form heralded in the trades should accompany the waning of whatever made them mildly interesting to the so-called consumer press, but the coincidence is worth noting. Except for ""Kiss on My List"" (number-one singles are laws unto themselves), the mildly interesting stuff is commercial filler: gently clever like ""Big Kids,"" secretly dark like ""Diddy Doo Wop (I Hear the Voices)."" And for all the hoo-hah surrounding Daryl and his ""repressed"" solo album, his singing is as pallid as his partner's: ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling"" is the greatest thing to happen to oldies stations since Grease.

Break up? Them? Nah, that was just a sabbatical, and to prove it here they are, crafting that platinum as craftily as they know how to justify their brand new advance. Daryl's stiff had nothing to do with it. Of course not. 'Cept that both records do overdo the overdubs, less fulsomely on this very model of second-hand black than when Daryl calls all the shots, but fatally nevertheless. I dare you to make out hitbounds like ""Missed Opportunity"" and ""Rockability"" or talismans like ""Downtown Life"" and ""Keep On Pushin' Love"" in the time it takes a music director to push reject. The album came out in May. It's dropping out of the top 200. It's not platinum. Justice abides in the world.

This Finnish fivesome is led by glam guys named Monroe and McCoy who yowl English-language lyrics that must impress Finns more than native speakers like myself. The quintet's patina of two-guitar anarchy is cute if overcalculated, but they seem to have spent more time contemplating their Dolls photos than their Dolls records.

Abetted by Brian Ahern, who would have been wise to add some Anne Murray schlock, Harris shows off a pristine earnestness that has nothing to do with what is most likable about country music and everything to do with what is most suspect in ""folk."" Presumably, Gram Parsons was tough enough to discourage this tendency or play against it, but as a solo mannerism it doesn't even ensure clear enunciation: I swear the chorus of the best song here sounds like it begins: ""I will rub my asshole/In the bosom of Abraham.""

This flows better than the first, but it also makes clear that Emmylou is just another pretty voice, a country singer by accident. I mean, Linda Ronstadt has the best female voice in country music, and even she doesn't satisfy the way an original like Dolly Parton or Loretta Lynn does. And since there's not a cover version here that equals its prototype, all she accomplishes with her good taste in material is to send you scurrying for the sources. I prefer Donna Fargo. Not Lynn Anderson, though.

Though the polyrhythms degenerate at times into steamy clutter, Harrison comes up with keyboard hooks I'd like to hear elsewhere; I recommend ""Slink"" to G. Clinton Assoc. But Jerry should keep his teeth clenched at all times. Bright enough not to try to carry a tune or anything, he apparently hasn't figured out that the talky voiceovers he essays instead are the worst fad of the year--it's as hard to avoid making them pompous or nagging or twerpy as it is, well, to sing.

She's known since ""Rapture"" where the dance action was, which is why Nile Rodgers produced KooKoo. So this last-ditch two-LP disco-targeted repackage, half of it totally extraneous 1988 remixes of group and solo titles by Jellybean, Coldcut, and lesser mortals, proves that knowing it ain't doing it. The spare-to-wimpy electrotrack of the original ""Rapture,"" for instance, is decisively more graceful than Teddy Riley's new beats. DOR was her destiny. And new jack is a new generation.

And with most of the hits all the way studio, the live stuff is long on covers, permitting Ann to run her suboperatic chops smack into ""Unchained Melody"" and ""Tell It Like It Is."" But the live ""Bebe Le Strange"" and the distaff ""Rock and Roll"" make them sound like contenders we need nevertheless.

Nope, Don wants drama and plenty of it--seven of 10 instrumental intros are 30 seconds plus, with three up around an L.A. minute (as distinguished from a ""New York Minute,"" 'cause Don says your life can change in one of those).

Suddenly, for no discernible reason, the Hollies seem to be aiming their schlock at the housewife market. The nadir, an attempted artsong called ""Marigold Gloria Swansong,"" is as aimless as bad (i.e. current) Bee Gees; usually they come on like the Sonny and Cher of slick harmony. The music hasn't lost its iridescence, but though they do generate one great soap opera--""Too Young to Be Married""--most of this is too crass for giggles.

It takes more than unsullied venality and the will to power to reign as the most revolting pop singer in Christendom. It takes active aesthetic miscalculation and, truth be told, more than a little luck. Like falling into the lame dance grooves of Jermaine Jackson and the odious megaschlock of Michael Masser, with Narada Michael Walden limited to ""How Will I Know""--which becomes your breakthrough song as well as the only critically forgivable thing on your best-selling debut album in history. So this time Walden gets seven shots, with Masser down to two and Jermaine returned to the bosom of his family, and the results are forgivable--she does have a good voice, you know.

Between ""Dead Homiez,"" which mourned murdered friends in a voice some called soft, and Boyz N the Hood, which required him to simulate thought, the St. Ides spokesperson was worried about his image. To use the only noun in the hard lexicon that suggests normal human sensitivities, he was acting like a ""faggot."" So here he reclaims his perpetually threatened manhood. Early on he mitigates the usual gangsta shit--gat as penis and pit bull, female body as pestilence and plague--with such touches as an antigang track and a nurse with attitude. But eventually he breaks new ground. In addition to many fascinated rhymes on the complex subject of who fucks who in the ass and how, he nuts out on white devils who crave ""a taste of chocolate"" because ""white bitches have no butt and no chest."" He inveighs against ""Jap"" and ""Jew."" And he proposes a ""nationwide boycott"" of Korean-owned inner-city businesses that escape the torch, poking gentle fun at the Korean accent along the way.

In a year when hards from Cam'ron to Trick Daddy illed with enough self-critical ambivalence and sly style to keep moralists off balance, Cube's boasts and threats are as utilitarian as Chucky Thompson's emailed-in beats. With faking the gat life no longer a realistic possibility, he's down to pretending his penis is a lethal weapon. And lest you hold his nonexistent sense of humor against him, the honcho orders up a Chris Rock cameo.

On ""God Forgive Me,"" the finale until the wittily grandiose Zionist-baiter ""Exodus"" was tacked on, comes a belated hint of the sardonic persona-mongering that once terrified a republic: Ice begs absolution for inventing the ""gangsta rap"" that ""changed the course of the world."" Maybe that's not as ridiculous as it seems. But certainly no such claim can be made for this clipped collection of pimp-dope-biz boasts/tales, which transcend genre hackwork only when anabused 16-year-old coos the title hook of ""Always Wanted To Be a Hoe"" like she can't wait to get the next dick in her mouth. Watching the O.G.'s back is a jaw-dropping procession of old-timers you hoped had gone into management, including Brother Marquis, Ant Banks, King Tee, Onyx, Kam, and, always last and always least, wee little Too Short.

Of course they know how to play--art-rockers usually do.

Distinguishable from competing relics of the Church of Iggy by the oddly qualified boast ""The Great Lost Stooges Album?"" (they do enjoy their punctuation over at Bomp!!), this one recycles the Raw Power follow-ups of the Rubber Legs EP, with dimmer sound than the ruinous underbassing Bowie inflicted on that piece of classic-openers-plus-filler, and also dimmer songs--""Cock in My Pocket"" might make somebody a second encore, ""Rubber Legs"" is a worthier title cut than ""Open Up and Bleed,"" and the rest belonged on the cutting room floor. Plus, wouldn't you know, equally dim live tapes designed to prove yet again that they did actually vamp longer than Hawkwind and Grinderswitch put together--anything rather than get down to business. Really, folks. He was seminal. He was damn good. He's not bad to this day. He wrote more anthems than Richard Berry himself. But anyone who thinks he's the spirit of the music has been taken in by the doomed theory that rock and roll is transgressive by definition.

The two first-rate songs, ""Minefield"" (about dancing in one) and ""Give Me"" (""What you can't get back""), were both singles. Each leads off a side that passes from the mind before it vacates the ear. Only the surrounding confusion of configurations indicates that the year isn't 1962--the B side of the ""Minefield"" twelve-inch features a ""Give Me"" remix plus the very mildly interesting ""No. 4.""

Compared to the diluted simple syrup of Swirl 360 or the teen-idol rappa-billy of Jimmy Ray, Imbruglia's modern pop is Rumours. Not only is she extraordinarily pretty without being too blatant in her babitude, she's got the brains and will to make up her own songs (and did I mention how pretty she is?). Thus she's earned our respect. But under all their state-of-the-studio-art, her competent songs are no more distinctive than the competent songs of hundreds of less pretty women. This was no stiff--RCA milked platinum and a follow-up single out of the sure shot she didn't write herself. But we should be proud that iconicity proved beyond Imbruglia's means. It's three cheers for democracy every time someone goes even a little broke underestimating the taste of the American public.

Incubus's wrinkle on awful points up how old-fashioned the death-metal and rap-fusion approaches to hard rock have become. The new menace is prog-variegated structures, tempo shifts, lyric interludes, DJ flava, and (daringly) love songs. This nets a lovely eight-minute closer featuring Steve Vai's ""ko-kyu,"" which sounds like a koto to me. It also nets many mediocre pop songs with pretensions.

Refreshing for white guys, especially white guys as dumb as these two, to complain about the slave owner on the dollar bill--simpleminded, but an act of cultural nonconformity nonetheless. Cool to give away a special-offer CD where you rap over stolen gangsta tracks, too. But when a real gangsta's bitch fucks his homey he kills everybody in sight. These kiss-offs just kill the girl, every chance they get. And though they claim clown, they rarely get funnier than ""I'd cut my head off but then I would be dead,"" and that on the cut everybody uses to prove how dumb they are. Personally, I think saying fuck 93 times in one song is a riot. Tell Fatboy Slim the news.

They bitch because everybody compares them to Joy Division, and they're right. It's way too kind, and I say that as someone who thanks Ian Curtis for making New Order possible. Joy Division struggled against depression rather than flaunting it, much less wearing it like a designer suit. What's truly depressing is that, just as the hairy behemoths of the grunge generation looked back to the AOR metal they immersed in as teens, these fops tweak the nostalgia of young adults who cherish indistinct memories of much worse bands than Joy Division, every one of them English--Bauhaus, Ultravox, Visage, Spandau Ballet, Tears for Fears. At a critical moment in consciousness they exemplify and counsel disengagement, self-seeking, a luxurious cynicism. Says certified British subject Peter Banks: ""Emotions are standard and boring.

Liberal plaints about hardcore protofascism are so ignorant that it's a little surprising to find a band who fit the bill. Oh, they do an anti-Moonie number and probably couldn't hack it in the KKK, but ""Put on Your Warpaint"" (""They send us spies/We send them grain"") is galloping anti-Russkie paranoia and ""White, Straight and Male"" (""I'm a victim of the quota system"") middle-class backlash at its most vicious. Relatively oblique about race (""no speak-a English"") and women (""I don't wanna catch your herpes""), they make it up on gays; though homophobia is only to be expected in sexually insecure young men whose brains are up their asses, and though pedophilia is hardly beyond criticism, I do think ""Man/Boy Love Sickie""--""You've got no human rights/We have to protect""--goes a bit far. Worst of all, sometimes they make it stick: ""White Castle at 3 A.M."" and ""Dance Club Meat Market"" are riotously memorable, two more scary reminders that lots of straight white males are feeling more squeeze than their talents deserve these days.

An orchestral album? By Joe Jackson? Sounded like the quickest reject in history, but I should have known better than to expect something so distinctive from this perpetually well-meaning guy. Not terrible by any means.

FALSE,C+,Maybe Tomorrow,Jackson 5,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7070,"
It's getting serious when the only discernible appeal of the title hit is that Michael is singing. The follow-up ""Never Can Say Goodbye,"" has more going for it. As do ""Sixteen Candles,"" originated by the Crests, and ""Honey Chile,"" originated by Martha &amp; the Vandellas.

FALSE,C+,The Flag,Rick James,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5064,"
I generally ignore charges that political content is commercially motivated, but with James I buy 'em. The Real Rick was the moist romantic fop of Glow, and when his self-expression didn't get over he churned out some lines on the Bomb, honing his craft by the by.

FALSE,C+,Wonderful,Rick James,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5065,"
Free at last from Mr. Gordy's plantation, James gives up that begged, borrowed, or stolen funk. ""Loosey's Rap"" casts Roxanne Shante as skeezer and proud (kudos in the Special Thanks list but not the credits to Big Daddy Kane and Marley Marl); ""So Tight"" is expert Larry Blackmon (ditto to ""Cameo for inspiration""); James himself could have sired ""Judy"" and ""Wonderful"" and ""Love's Fire."" But he still can't resist ballads, a big mistake for a man who spells l-u-v like c-u-m. Docked a notch for first peeping as ""the girls go down,"" then suggesting that a devil lesbian get straight by dropping to her knees and fishing his dick out.

FALSE,C+,Kettle Whistle,Jane's Addiction,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5206,"
As its current projects crumble from irrelevance to negative cash flow, a band that never made music or money commensurate with its myth bestows upon a shock-sated marketplace outtakes, demos, live tracks, and four proofs of physical reunion. Chutzpah has never been Perry Bernstein's problem.

This man has the looks and voice and technique and support of an instant superstar. So why isn't he? Maybe because he neither writes nor interprets songs with the soul to match his freeze-dried facility.

FALSE,C+,Bark,Jefferson Airplane,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7106,"
This isn't as bad as the faithless claim (a lot better than Bite, for instance), but it's definitely a collection of weirdnesses rather than an album: duh boys in duh band sing a cappella, Grace sings German, Grace defies cop, Hot Tuna outtake, fiddle feature, and so forth. And so on.
"
FALSE,C+,Long John Silver,Jefferson Airplane,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7107,"
Easily the most coherent album to come from Airplane Associates since Volunteers--the music is muscular, the hole left by Marty Balin finally covered over. But the printed lyrics are catchier than the tunes. Grace sings like she's facing Mecca, and Paul sings like an automatic pilot. Which suggests that maybe a hole is still there.
"
FALSE,C+,Dragon Fly,Jefferson Starship,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7109,"
The key cut here is Grace Slick's gnomic ""Hyperdrive,"" in which supertechnology (spirit-powered, perhaps?) cuts through ""corners in time."" If in 1973 you'd been responsible for Baron von Tollbooth and the Chrome Nun (Jefferson Jitney), Thirty Seconds Over Winterland (dead live), and Bodacious D.F. (Marty's party), you'd want to think you'd turned a corner in 1974 yourself. But though this does achieve a slick modernization of their polyvocal sound (Barbata-powered, definitely), with Papa John Creach's fiddle and Craig Chaquico's guitar synthesizing past and future for purposes of metaphor and stage presentation as Marty Balin's cameo contribution links them audibly to their own history, it also proves that you can't get along forever on generalized imprecations against the powerful and invidious oriental-occidental comparisons.

FALSE,C+,Flight Log,Jefferson Starship,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7112,"
The truism is that their history matched the counterculture's from optimism to visions to anger to dissolution, and this compilation devotes more than a disc to phase four. I really tried to pin down some overarching theme I'd missed at the time, but dissolution seems to be it--not only did they have nothing to say, they didn't have much to say it with. The three Hot Tuna cuts sound fresh and intelligent by comparison, and the '60s stuff--only two repeats from Worst plus a live ""Somebody to Love""--is, well, optimistic and visionary and angry.

FALSE,C+,One Eyed-Jack,Garland Jeffreys,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7116,"
If this were a ""sellout"" it would be mottled with slavish attempts at a catchiness inimical to the reggaefied groove Jeffreys explores so deliberately. Take it as Product Due from an artist who for some reason hasn't written any of his best songs in the past year, and hope his muse returns.

FALSE,C+,Guts for Love,Garland Jeffreys,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5071,"
Jeffreys's odd weakness for rock without roll is the ruination of this overproduced, undercomposed anachronism--even the reggae grooves are tinged with synthesized AOR melodrama, and the dance numbers do not jump jump.
"
FALSE,C+,Aqualung,Jethro Tull,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7122,"
Ian Anderson is like the town free thinker. As long as you're stuck in the same town yourself, his inchoate cultural interests and skeptical views on religion and human behavior are refreshing, but meet up with him in the city and he can turn out to be a real bore. Of course, he can also turn out to be Bob Dylan--it all depends on whether he rejected provincial values out of a thirst for more or out of a reflexive (maybe even somatic) negativism. And on whether he was pretentious only because he didn't know any better.

FALSE,C+,Bleed American,Jimmy Eat World,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10323,"
Jimmy Eat World are who Blink-182 want to be when they grow up--even played B-182 frontman Tom DeLonge's wedding. Since JEW frontman Jim Adkins specializes in sensitive leaps and catches, this bodes well for DeLonge's visits to the marriage counselor, but it'll ruin his whine. Like most emo bands only at a higher level of tunecraft, JEW are so surprised to discover that punks become adults that they're impressed by feelings even a folksinger would know were banal. Their label hopes that pop fans won't care--that if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis.

I won't deny Buckwheat Zydeco's blunt punch or Boozoo Chavis's toothless charm. But tell me this squeezeboxing party animal ""invented the contemporary zydeco sound"" and I'm on the next bus to Biloxi. How do you play the guitar rhythms of ""Tighten Up"" on accordion? Approximately, but not so's anyone content with such clueless covers of ""Boogie Chillun"" and, Lord help us, ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" is oing to mind. I'll grant you ""Cisco Kid"" if you'll admit you have trouble remembering anything self-penned beyond ""Give Him Cornbread.""

As Joel's craft improves--I can recall four of these songs merely by glancing at titles--he becomes more obnoxious: the anti-idealism of ""Angry Young Man"" isn't any more appealing in tandem with the pseudoironic sybaritism of ""I've Loved These Days."" But I do catch myself in moments of identification with the three place-name songs on side one--""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" more than the overrated ""New York State of Mind.""

Dear Elton: If you're trying to claim it's all Bernie's fault, just hold on. One half of a songwriting team can always bail the other out of rock and roll as competent and (not counting that new sexist streak) unexcessive as this, as each of you proved on Honky Chateau. Maybe Bernie refuses to outgrow his pistol envy. But that's no reason for you to make the music not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper.

FALSE,C+,The One,Elton John,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5876,"
Fun automaton, floundering has-been, or unnoticed fixture, he hung in there, so that 1992 was the 23rd consecutive year he put a single in the top 40. Since Elvis himself only got to 22, this statistical aberration merits a tribute, and though I was disarmed by the news that he'd not only come out but was donating all singles royalties to AIDS research, I decided to take it as a long overdue hint to ignore his albums. Unfortunately, the first single was an all-too-well-plugged Eric Clapton feature. Then came an AIDS ballad drenched in midtempo melodrama, followed by a title tune that's just as soupy with less content. So here's hoping somebody at MCA likes ""Sweat It Out,"" a fast dance number about vanquishing the forces of reaction. Inspirational Verse That Saves Me a Review: ""No more Tears for Fears/Give me tears of rage.""

FALSE,C+,Heartbeat,Don Johnson,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5086,"
Is the news that a competent singer has emulated his best buddies' music enough to get him on the cover of Rolling Stone? Formally, after all, it's the 1986 equivalent of a fifteen-minute extravaganza about Atlantis--bizzers at their most empty and self-congratulatory. What redeems it up to a point is Miami Vice's garish vision of El Lay rock as the epitome of high-rolling sleaze, hyping jaded emotions into some semblance of recognizability. And what does it in is Johnson's competence. Tina Turner can make such stuff signify, but Johnson, who rasps through his TV lines, goes clear when he sings. Isn't knowing Don Henley good for anything?

FALSE,C+,Shine On,George Jones,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5093,"
Charley Pride couldn't get away with the lucky songs Billy Sherrill's stuck George with this time, and though the unlucky songs are better, superstar guilt and second-convolution cheating just don't suit him. Granted, ""Ol' George Stopped Drinkin' Today"" is a near-perfect fit. But when it comes to ""Almost Persuaded,"" I'll take the original--by David Houston, Tammy's first singing partner.
"
FALSE,C+,Portfolio,Grace Jones,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7155,"
This disco queen sings flat enough to make Andrea True sound like Linda Ronstadt and Tom Verlaine like Art Garfunkel, which is nice--very liberated, very punky. But it's less than ironic that a woman who demands an end to jealousy--that is, who demands the same license to fuck around that male rock stars claim as their due--should (as a fashion model) occupy a similar power position. And while I prefer her version of ""Send in the Clowns"" to Judy Collins's, I'd just as soon she cover ""Pretty Vacant"" or something.

FALSE,C+,Used Guitars,Marti Jones,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2279,"
She satisfies that familiar hankering for self-expression, a disquiet known to any female interpreter worth her salt, by doing her lesser songwriting buddies some favors--at least their material will be identified solely with her.

FALSE,C+,"Oran ""Juice"" Jones","Oran ""Juice"" Jones",1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5105,"
Supposedly, this is the lowdown on love men: when his lady ventures off her pedestal, Juice drops the sensitive act and treats her like a gangster. And love him or hate him, he's about talking, not singing. I mean, personally I find his brand loyalties and ""y'unnerstand?""s kinda revolting, but he talks 'em like he walks 'em, so I can understand why hipper folks think they're hilarious parodies of the player's life and line. What I don't get is why any lady should be fooled by his sensitive act--he's got the falsetto to negotiate the second-rate Chi-Lites songs his raps are buried in, but not to put them across. Which makes the concept a cheat and the album a bore.
"
FALSE,C+,Pirates,Rickie Lee Jones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5107,"
Crossing Springsteen and Waits from a male-identified female point of view, Jones doesn't let on whether she's narrating or evoking. She slurs like a convinced lush. Her impressionistically structured, jazz-tinged studio arrangements are the El Lay equivalent of art-rock. In short, she writes and sings and composes as if she has something to hide. From herself, most likely.
"
FALSE,C+,Lost in Space,Jonzun Crew,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5110,"
I love ""Space Cowboy,"" in which hooks from Tom Tom Club and Clint Eastwood converge on the ghost of Gary Numan. Elsewhere, however, Numan's shade has all too much space to him/itself. Sure the cross-rhythms are niftier, and I know Bambaataa has given this kind of silliness his blessing. But not everybody can be blessed--or silly.

FALSE,C+,Janis Joplin,Janis Joplin,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7159,"
Because it captures such subtle yet essential virtues as intelligence, humor, and compassion as well as the big stuff she was famous for, film may have been Janis's real medium, and I recommend the documentary to which this double-LP is the putative soundtrack. But it ought to be seen and not heard--most of these cuts are available elsewhere, and the newly compiled early tapes are the rather tinny record of a singer who hasn't found her music or her band.

Between fun and the idea of fun falls the shadow--in a word, self-consciousness. Self-consciousness doesn't stop Fannypack, but these Danes aren't tuned-in enough for stereotype play. It didn't stop the B-52's, ditto, plus the Danes lack Fred, Cindy, Kate, and especially Ricky. If anything, their model is the much simpler and purer KC and the Sunshine Band, who upon direct comparison prove not so simple and hence purer. Pardon my poop. But I'm out of this party.

FALSE,C+,Blows Against the Empire,Paul Kantner/Jefferson Starship,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7165,"
Not counting friendly neighbors, there are only two changes from the usual Airplane lineup on this ""solo"" venture: Jerry Garcia replaces Jorma Kaukonen for reasons of interstellar propulsion, and Paul Kantner replaces Marty Balin for reasons of ego. As much Marty's ego as Paul's, probably--I wouldn't want my name on this thing either. Kantner's singing is as murky as his melodies (there's a connection there somewhere) and for all the record's sci-fi pretensions (does Philip K. Dick actually like this stuff?) it never even gets off the ground.

FALSE,C+,World Beat,Kaoma,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5123,"
I find it impossible to work up the fine pitch of loathing this piece of product arouses among the right-thinking. It's only a) hit-plus-filler and b) Europop, lame two ways by definition, which is no reason to listen to it but also no reason to be dismayed by its lameness; the lameness of the Brazilian dance-pop it rips off is more dismaying, because it's more misguided. In a time when Third World musicians dream of First World rich-and-famous, when Parisian sensibility deracinates the rhythms of the African diaspora one day and adds muscle to them the next, when France seeks to regain world cultural preeminence by embracing an essentially spurious multiracialism, lambada fits an inevitable market niche. It's Europop with a cafï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ au lait face and a bouncy bottom, and on the hit and the two cuts that follow it has the vulgar vitality"

As if he were Dick Griffey or somebody, admirers cite the radio appeal of this Brooklyn pheenom's smooth concoctions and recall the heroic deeds of Berry Gordy. Whether that rings true with you depends on whether you value the radio of the '80s as much as that of the '60s.

In a year when the big rappers have either repeated tired outrages or outgrown them, Kelly's crude, chartwise new jack swing is black pop's most depressing development. An effective singer in the post-Stevie new-soul mode whose way with a beat is confirmed by an impressive catalogue of bestselling productions, he aims his common denominator straight at the solar plexus. He has no apparent interest in tune--the Spinners' ""Sadie"" sounds positively angelic after ""Summer Bunnies"" and ""I Like the Crotch on You."" And despite a few moments of class consciousness, he displays far less human decency in his quest for booty than such unaltruistic competitors as Jodeci and Boyz II Men. But lest anyone suspect he lacks moral acuity, he offers this Inspirational Liner Note: ""To all those women out there when I step off in a club--don't treat me like I'm just anybody because you end up treating me like I'm nobody and that's wrong.""
"
FALSE,C+,At His Best,Eddie Kendricks,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7172,"
Rarely has a talented singer been so ill-served by his corporate connections without failing altogether. Kendricks doesn't have the depth of a natural solo performer--the sweet clarity of his falsetto rang nice spiritual overtones against his more earthbound fellow Temptations, but it gets thin all by itself--and he needs good material to compensate. This ain't it. Most of these songs were hits, but the two uptempo smashes, ""Keep On Truckin'"" and ""Boogie Down,"" are proto-disco at its most ominously one-dimensional, and except for the Tempts' ""Just My Imagination"" and the never-a-hit ""Skippin' Work Today,"" the rest range from passable (""He's a Friend"") to deplorable (""Shoeshine Boy"").

FALSE,C+,Life Is a Dance: The Remix Project,Chaka Khan,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5135,"
This peculiar compilation of newly commissioned remixes makes two artistic assumptions. First, that Chaka's voice and expressive reach render her the Aretha of the '80s. Second, that for various house-identified producers to fiddle with eleven of her solo titles is both an homage to and a reinterpretation of her oeuvre--even when, as does happen, her voice and expressive reach are reduced to icing and florets in the process. I accept neither. And I discern a commercial assumption underneath it all--here's a low-cost way to milk Chaka's cult.

The queen of world music isn't merely a big voice--she's also a compact body. Plus, terrific Afro-Parisian clothes sense. And to top it all off, a crew cut. In short (five-one, maybe five-two), she's a disco queen with a gimmick--earthier than Ya Kid K, maybe, but less grounded. And the follow-up doesn't even have ""Batonga""'s synth riff to jolly you past the guitar solos. (Well, actually it does--it just doesn't have another one.)

Initially this record sounds like a mechanical follow-up to Tapestry. Then you begin to notice the subtle musical advances and the ever more assured backup, especially from guitarists Danny Kootch and James Taylor and saxophonist Curtis Amy, and start humming ""Sweet Seasons"" or ""Song of Long Ago."" Then you realize it's really just a mechanical follow-up to Tapestry. I love Carole King, but her value is as limited as it is intense, and her lyrics are banal even when she doesn't write them.

For a long time I thought this was the worst rock band in history simply because it was the most pretentious, but sometimes pretensions are (at least partially) earned. Their second album is more muddled conceptually than In the Court of the Crimson King, quite a feat. But they're not afraid to be harsh, they command a range of styles, and their dynamics jolt rather than sledgehammer (properly electric, that). Also, they can play: kudos to drummer Michael Giles and guitarist Robert Fripp, who also illustrates the old adage, ""Better a Mellotron than real strings.""

Ray Davies is a sensitive artist, but he's never had an idea worth reducing to prose in his life.

Hook-laden and hard-rocking, this is the best-crafted Kinks album in over a decade, which means that for someone who's found Ray Davies's world-view increasingly mean-spirited and mush-brained, it's also the biggest turnoff. Back when he was chairing the Village Green Preservation Society, Ray's dotty lyricism put his nostalgia in appealing and appropriate musical perspective; his current clean-cut arena style makes him sound smug and strident, as well it should. Opening with a piece of radio pimpery in which a deejay becomes not just a benefactor (lie enough these days) but a hero of modern mythos, it moves on to songs about paranoids, battered wives, murderers, and dirty old men that reveal minimal charity for either side of the interactions they put down.

Success of the Vegas/television sort does more than pollute the sensibility--it diverts one's attention from the grubby business of making records. It took two production teams to turn out this arrant product, a sure sign she knows something's wrong. Strongest cut: the Pips' (and Eugene McDaniels's) ""Street Brother.""

FALSE,C+,The Ernie Kovacs Album,Ernie Kovacs,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11318,"
Kovacs could make me laugh very hard when he was alive, but that was 15 or 20 years ago, and like a lot of comedy his material doesn't age well, at least not for me. I mean, a lisping poet who complains to Brooth about his martini? (Compare Bob and Ray's ""Charles the Poet, on RCA's sadly deleted Golden Age of Comedy.) As with the TV revivals the record is not without laughs, but they come about once every five or 10 gags, wan little chuckles that feel forced even when they're involuntary.

FALSE,C+,Gorillas in the Mix,Bernie Krause & Human Remains,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5163,"
""Every sound on this record has been created from the voices of animals except as noted in the credits,"" claims the credits intro, which goes on to list six different keybmen and no other players. And sure enough, the coyotes, dolphins, whales, walruses, and (yes) turkeys who carry the electrofunky tunes all sound like synthesizers. Now is that sick or what? Hi-hat chores go to the snapping shrimp, kick drum to the ruffed grouse, and so forth, with the key copout ""from the voices,"" for rarely are the voices of animals heard on this disc; whenever a horse or crow or pig or otter is allowed an untreated interjection it comes as a moment of grace. You don't have to be an animal rightser to believe that only a hairless biped could conceive anything so cosmically cutesy.

FALSE,C+,Rock & Reel,La Bottine Souriante,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5220,"
Winking whenever the folk do something cute (or dirty), wearing an I [Heart] Jazz button on their collective sleeve, this accordion-fiddle-horns nonet epitomizes the cloying multicultural sophistication that infests ""world music."" I'd hoped they were French, but in fact they're Quï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½becois, which makes sense--the Breton-Celt connectio""fun"" fun. Bilbao's Kepa Junkera proves it's possible to keep eclecticism clean. This kind of stuff gives purism a good name.

FALSE,C+,Keep Smiling,Laid Back,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5339,"
The Danes in this duo are to disco what the Germans in Trio are to rock and roll--just as deliberately minimalist but, in the tradition of the genre, a lot smarmier. If you wanna be rich, scratch 'em where they itch.

FALSE,C+,Trouble,Ray Lamontagne,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13097,"
I admire LaMontagne, who's had nothing handed to him. But it bodes ill that the Stephen Stills album that moved him to quit his factory job was a '90s one. Just as we live in a world where some radio stations get on Stills's latest, we live in a world where some record buyers suck up folk-rock verities--to which LaMontagne adds nothing but a backstory. Since his admirers bring up Van Morrison, it is my duty to report that he lacks Morrison's voice, poetry, Gaelic soul, and r&amp;b feel--in other words, everything that once made Van worth bringing up. Nothing lasts forever, folk-rock included.

FALSE,C+,Shine,Daniel Lanois,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12203,"
Born September 19, 1951, Lanois has mortality on his mind, and ""I Love You"" nails it: ""Come sure, come soon, come leave just one song/One song, one beat, one dust, one end, one for all/One stone for the marking for the dream when it falls."" But this isn't literature, and since true fatalism requires a steely resolve that the failed humility and fake passivity of Lanois's gauzy sound don't comprehend, I pray somebody makes those lines worth hearing. Or no, not pray--there's enough of that in ""Shine,"" a hymn to Sol, and ""Falling at Your Feet,"" a hymn to God.

FALSE,C+,A Night to Remember,Cyndi Lauper,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5353,"
Can you believe she's talking this one up as a triumph of self-expression (meaning ""personal"" songs, like that Kodak ad) over spiritual adversity (meaning commercial shortfall)? How embarrassing to have placed hope in this woman. And how sad to compare the bold finds and off-the-wall vulgarity of the only good album she'll ever make to this bigtime pop--a parameter stretched not an iota by songs about one's very own breakup, not to mention strokes as prudently defiant as the lyric about not being a pet, which was probably Christina Amphlett's idea anyway.

FALSE,C+,Love More Than Pride,Laura Lee,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7264,"
The title of this belated but opportune package from Lee's old label says it all--in her previous incarnation, she was a not-quite-great voice without a gimmick, just like so many of her sisters. For some reason, two minor hits from 1967--""Wanted: Lover, No Experience Necessary"" and ""Up Tight Good Man""--aren't included. Might give it a little more flair. Might push it over thirty minutes, too.
"
FALSE,C+,Come On Feel,The Lemonheads,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5890,"
Evan Dando is a good-looking guy with more luck than talent and more talent than brains who conceals his narcissism beneath an unassuming suburban drawl. Twenty years ago he would have affected an acoustic guitar and acted sincere; now he affects a slacker-pop band and acts vulnerable. His songs don't bite, they sidle over and nibble your ear when you're not looking, and if you throw him a withering glance, no problem--he'll just move on to someone else. Exception: the one about drugs.

FALSE,C+,Mind Games,John Lennon,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7268,"
A step in the right direction, but only a step. It sounds like outtakes from Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, which may not seem so bad but means that Lennon is falling back on ideas that have lost their freshness for him. Still, the single works and I hope he keeps on stepping. Favorite Plastic Ono Band outtake: ""One Day (at a Time)."" Favorite Imagine outtake: ""You Are Here.""

FALSE,C+,Imagine: John Lennon: Music from the Original Motion Picture,John Lennon,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5365,"
Nothing wrong with the music, though you can do without the bait--""Imagine"" work tape, carefully hoarded new song work tape.

FALSE,C+,Diva,Annie Lennox,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5877,"
The honorable Timothy White avers, ""Her vocals have never felt performed,"" which those of us who don't commune regularly with the stars can take as a sign that the guy's been in show business too long. It's our belief that Ms. Lennox's vocals have never felt anything but performed--and that this palpably phony quality was her chief charm even though it meant that at her most nuevo wavo she was destined to turn conventional pop singer sooner or later. So here she goes normal, if that's what you call somebody who emotes banalities to her baby daughter loud enough to wake the disco: ""precious little angel . . . [percolating bass] . . . bundle full of love . . . drowned in my own tears . . . [cool trumpet solo] . . . gift from heaven . . ."" Thank your maker she fades it instead of going out on a high note.

Certainly not ""Nubian."" Biology not being destiny, not ""Cameroonian"" either. ""Princesses"" metaphorically if at all. Not ""Miriam Makeba meets Wyclef Jean"" or any half of same. ""Soul II Soul meets Zap Mama"" a smidgen. ""Sisters"" if they say so, ""soul"" if the ""5th Annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards"" says so. ""French"" definitely, ""hip-hop"" forget about it.

If only they'd had twenty-four-track consoles in the '60s, maybe Byrds albums would sound as great as their legend. And if only Mitch Easter had something to say, maybe Let's Active albums would sound as great as Byrds albums--although even Michael Clarke provided more forward motion than this.

If the blood were literally young, the Killer would now be the Vampire. Instead, producer-wunderaltekacker Andy Paley is the Ghoul. Jerry Lee can still rock the 88s, but his natural voice is a croak or a wheeze, as he proves by heroically holding ""Gotta Travel On""'s final ""long"" until it tails into the pitchless pit he's already filled with croaks and wheezes. He couldn't get away with ""Thirty-Nine and Holding"" at 45. Yet at 60 he still wishes he was 18 again.

This went number one in England--they're getting so stuck up over there they're even growing their own simpletons. The melodies throw a hook now and again, and the harmonies are tarter than CSNY's--that deep-seated modal tradition, y'know. But though they complain in ""City Song"" that ""your music""--by which they mean our music, fellow urbanites--""it doesn't speak, it swears,"" their own lyrics aren't worth mumbling.

Aphrodisiac they ain't--just Hispanic and, supposedly, fly. Hell's Kitchen scullions who've made good in typical one-part-talent-to-ten-parts-application Fame fashion, they're just streetsmart enough to want nothing so much as to escape to the suburbs.

Lisa got to sing ""I Wonder If I Take You Home"" because she sounded like the kind of amateur who might put words to the tune of yah-yah yah-yah-yah. At album length her musical comedy training comes to the fore. A Rosie &amp; the Originals for our more pretentious time.

FALSE,C+,Down on the Farm,Little Feat,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7286,"
Not a bad Doobie Brothers parody, but the harmonies were better last time and the laugh lines are in short supply. Might be funnier if they targeted the Doobies '79 rather than the Doobies '75.
"
FALSE,C+,The Rill Thing,Little Richard,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7287,"
Little Richard produced this alleged comeback in Muscle Shoals. He also wrote most of the songs, including the ""hit,"" ""Freedom Blues"" (""Tutti Frutti"" it ain't), and the title track, a slow ten-minute funk instrumental on which he doesn't even seem to play piano (very rill). I continue to value his singing. Best compositions: ""Lovesick Blues"" and ""I Saw Her Standing There.""
"
FALSE,C+,Voice of America,Little Steven,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5385,"
I deeply respect Steven Van Zandt's brave translation of rock and roll libertarianism into internationalist antiwar propaganda, and I don't think he's done badly by the songwriting--somebody cover ""Fear,"" or ""Justice,"" or ""Among the Believers."" But please, please, please don't make me listen to him sing them anymore. His voice is devoid of dynamic or dramatic zip. When he's not bellowing, he's plodding. And he's got a band to match.
"
FALSE,C+,Throwing Copper,Live,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5919,"
On stage, this intently mediocre young band is U2 without a guitar sound. On record, it's R.E.M. without songs. Fittingly, it generates the ""idealistic"" arena-rock U2 is no longer hungry enough to bother with and R.E.M never had the stomach to work up. Only with the old guys I wouldn't put the saving word in quotes.

FALSE,C+,Bigger and Deffer,L.L. Cool J,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5388,"
Like the pop-metal egotists he resembles every which way but white, J proves that there's something worse than a middle-class adolescent who's gotta be a big shot this instant--the same adolescent the instant he becomes a big shot. Overrated though it was, the debut had guts, spritz, musical integrity, and Rick Rubin. Breakthrough though it may be, the follow-up has a swelled head, a swollen dick, received beats, and quotes from Berry, Brown, and the Moonglows that confuse me. Could it be that the planet existed before he brought it to fruition?
"
FALSE,C+,Nils,Nils Lofgren,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7296,"
If Lofgren's early mini-Western, ""Rusty Gun,"" was the modestly laconic offering of an up-and-comer who remembered, then ""No Mercy,"" the boxing melodrama now getting airplay, is the rodomontade of a shoulda-been-a-contender. I bet cocomposer Lou Reed wrote the best line, but Nils sings it with indubitable bitterness: ""I thought you were being ironic when you ripped your jeans.""
"
FALSE,C+,Flip,Nils Lofgren,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5389,"
The wuntime wunderkind is ""talkin' 'bout survival,"" which he at least points out beats ""self denial,"" and I guess it's a small miracle that he's no longer the blustering never-was of the late '70s. But 1983's Wonderland testified more gracefully to his eternal youth, and even there it was hard to tell what he's learned since 1971. To seek eternal youth in the absence of temporal wisdom is one of the great American vices, and most Americans aren't even wise enough to know it.

FALSE,C+,Keep the Fire,Kenny Loggins,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7297,"
I used to think Kenny had no sense of rhythm, but his problems were actually less severe--he just couldn't rock. This Tom Dowd-produced Doobie-disco job swings just like Jesse Colin Young. And if you think it isn't Doobie-disco, tell me why the one great song on the record was written with Michael McDonald. ""This Is It,"" it's called, and it is.
"
FALSE,C+,Vox Humana,Kenny Loggins,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5390,"
""My goal was to transform my music into a more and more personal medium,"" says this harmless case study in contemporary pop of his first self-produced album, so he must think a lot about ""love,"" a word which appears in seven of the nine songs. The subject is all-important for sure, but tricky to make new, as they say. Loggins succeeded in 1979 with the put-up-or-shut-up epiphany ""This Is It."" Here he hopes his rhythmic savvy and supple falsetto prove epiphany enough for Contemporary Hits Radio. Which given the promotional budget and catchy arrangement of the confidently entitled title tune, they already have.

FALSE,C+,The Best of Friends,Loggins and Messina,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7298,"
I suppose this compilation deserves points for hummability and getting it over with--eight of the ten songs are from the first two albums, so it's about time--but there's just too much to forgive. The memory of K. clapping his hands like a seal while exhorting a Cheech &amp; Chong crowd to ""boogie."" The memory of FM programmers offering up ""You Mama Don't Dance"" as a tribute to the uptempo demons. The note that compares that song to ""Wilbur Harrison's version of `Kansas City'"" (it's Wilbert, you ignorami, and it sure ain't ""Kansas City""). And especially the note that connects the even limper ""My Music"" to ""the simplicity of the early Chuck Berry days."" The nerve. Chuck Berry had genius, energy, soul, spunk, wit, irreverence, brains, urgency, a good beat, a criminal record, a number-one record, brown skin, a pompadour, and a duckwalk. All they've got is a million dollars--or less, I hope.

""A cross between Jimi Hendrix and Ritchie Valens,"" guitarist Henry Garza suggested modestly last year, and strangely, the big problem isn't that Henry is no Stevie Ray Vaughan. It's that these three Chicano brothers lack the main thing the forever incomparable Hendrix and prematurely sainted Valens shared--youthful pizzazz. The Lonely Boys' dad, Ringo Sr. (Ringo Jr., make of it what you will, plays drums), has been touring them so long that by now they're old pros--assimilated, acculturated, attenuated. So the obvious comparison is also dead accurate: Los Lobos tamed.  You want something fancier, call them a cross between Santana and Air Supply.

With David Byrne and Arto Lindsay replaced by the Soho equivalent of studio musicians, Peter Gordon turns to self-consciously chickenshit disco/soundtrack mewzick, kitsch he posits as punk and/or no wave and/or minimalism's next convolution. No no no, ""posits"" is wrong, bring that back to ""parodies."" How about ""exploits""? Whatever, the important thing is that their friends think it's cool and people they meet at parties don't.

Wish I could work up the fine pitch of loathing this received, synthesized, male chauvinist pop metal theoretically deserves, but in fact it's not completely awful: ""Working for the Weekend"" articulates a real class dilemma, ""Get Lucky"" puns on the band's careerist fortunes, and ""Emotional"" is a better Stones rip than ""It's Only Rock 'n Roll.""

As a statement of principle, the title track is scary-good and creatively derivative; put into practice it's scary-stupid and oppressively ordinary. How do we get MPR? By play-acting bully-boy scenarios that sound petty enough to be from life and making up others we'd never have the guts for--one production number climaxes with, eek, a hand grenade! And by showing an endless profusion of imaginary bitches who the man is--the other production number climaxes when three gold-digging skeezers, as they were called in the good old days, end up with their blood all over the tracks.

Maybe the Allmans supported Bush too, though I bet not; maybe that fox Ronnie Van Zant would have turned into Charlie Daniels, though he would have nuanced it. But Daniels is Donald Fagen up against the backup-singer cheerleading and golden-oldies smarm of Johnny Van Zant, and where the Allmans replaced their mythic front line with Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, who jam at least as tight and hot, Gary Rossington didn't anchor that peachy a guitar section to begin with. A few of the post-Ronnie songs are surprisingly decent--""Red, White and Blue,"" for instance, is about Johnny's neck, hair, and collar. But you know what else it's about, and in case you don't he has four or five ways to rub it in, including thanks to God for the lovely Nashville night. Not Memphis, not Jacksonville--Nashville.

""You can take your change on down the road/And leave me here with mine,"" Johnny Van Zant begins one of the two songs that take up the title theme after has run through the pleasures of home, the perfidy of woman, and the mixed blessings of the music business for the umpteenth time. Like the wary younger sibling he's always been, Johnny will always hold onto a quarter and settle for what he knows, or thinks he does. Really, he ought to have some inkling that nobody worthy of his trepidation wants to ban hunting, burn the Bible, or slam old Uncle Sam, although actually that no smoking sign means exactly what it says. On the other hand, ""Unwrite That Song"" would make a nice B side for Darius Rucker.

The first soundtrack ever patterned after a field recording, this suite/montage/succession of hums, moans, claps, and plucked fragments, all keyed to Lightnin' Hopkins's gorgeous gospel blues ""Needed Time,"" is regarded by one trustworthy observer, Greil Marcus, as Taj's most eloquent music.

Things finally get going toward the end of side two with an insane Howlin' Wolf imitation and a calypso-blues trucking song complete with CB.

These minor early-'70s hits aren't what her admirers consider the best (that's coming out right now on Dot), but they do foreshadow her concept, in which she applies her limpid center and soft edges to such soul classics as ""Show Me"" and ""Do Right Woman"" and then sells them to the country audience--by upping the tempos, oddly enough. Hard to figure what's so innovative--didn't that Presley guy do something similar? And when he went to Vegas, he went on his own terms.

I approve of their Latin-funk concept and I'm struck by their name--a mandrill is one mother of a baboon, and what do you think a man drill might be? But their music has proven disappointingly tame. Even the big hit sequence on side one--""Fencewalk"" to ""Git It All"" to ""Hang Loose""--isn't exactly a rampage. Which is probably why the hits weren't go-rillas.

All I know is this poster girl for the DIY fallacy is still the ultimate NPR middlebrow, addressing disillusioned love songs to the biz the way Christians address illusioned ones to the Lord Jesus.

As this group moves closer to the jazzy style it no doubt covets, it begins to show the corners of its rhythmic box. As well as minimal self-knowledge--Mann's strength has always been song interpretation, after all.

Instead, his banned-in-Wal-Mart slipcase job will fade into the haze of records people found interesting at the time. Its strategy is to camouflage the feebleness of La Manson's vocal affect by pretending it's deliberate--one more depersonalizing production device with which to flatten willing cerebella whilst confronting humankind's alienation, amorality, and failure to have a good time on Saturday night. Catchiest songs: ""The Dope Show"" and ""I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)."" Duh.

Maybe she could sing the telephone book and make me like it, but compared to the telephone book, ""You make love like springtime and I can't control my passion/You make love like springtime even when love's not in fashion"" lacks serendipity--especially after five minutes, with seasonal changes for variety and a jazzy 3:20 reprise for excess measure.

Despite a few jarringly saccharine choral bits and some dumb screeching, this mostly instrumental enterprise by John Mayall grads Jon Mark and Johnny Almond is indeed relaxing--so relaxing people are getting excited about it. That's what happens when you confuse enlightenment with more mundane contemplative states. Miles Davis's In a Silent Way on the one hand and Booker T.'s Melting Pot on the other are just as pleasant and offer both thrills and substance underneath. This offers neither.

The first analogy is Alice Coltrane, who also trivializes a faith her husband brought miraculously and paradoxically alive with simple-minded music, but though it's just as well Rita doesn't play the harp, Merry Clayton and Patti Austin are more to the point: beware of backup singers' solo albums, no matter how surefire the single or committed the session men.

Major-label flunky that he was, Eno sold them out--one of their No New York tunes could be ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" told by an imbecile, signifying nothing. Arto Lindsay is more steadfast--at this Christmas 1978 session he reveals his eternal CBGB billmates as the skronk nightmare of DNA's dreams. The voices are mixed-back exclamations and yowls. The guitars are all sludge, bang, and buzz--no chords, no timing, no articulation, maybe an upsurge occasionally. The drummer's job is to destroy any rudiment of a beat. Noise won't get much purer than this--I don't think.

FALSE,C+,De-Loused in the Comatorium,The Mars Volta,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12204,"
The most unrepentantly prog band to break in years began when Puerto Rico-born guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Mexican American vocalist Cedric Bixler Zavala rejected At the Drive-In's post-hardcore strictures, with Rodriguez citing salsa as a crucial influence. But his guitar montunos aren't salsa any more than Jon Theodore's Haiti-inflected heavy-muscle drumming is vodun. Salsa requires a groove, which the old people know embodies the community to which each individual is subordinate--such as At the Drive-In's forward thrash, which subsumes the complex songforms and explosive guitar from which the Mars Volta audibly proceed. In the case of Rodriguez's phrases and noises, romantic individualism has its uses. But Bixler's highfalutin inanities--the imagined dreamlife of a suicidal artist, all clotted surrealism and Geddy Lee theatrics--need whatever subordination they can get.

This is the sort of record you buy out of duty and then never play, not because it's a comedy record but because it isn't funny out of context.

Led by matched admirers of Jimi Hendrix and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, anchored by a former Anita Baker road drummer, and spiced by a former Three O'Clock gittar man, their sorta-major sorta-debut is way too all-embracing at 17 songs and umpteen cross-genres, following their sorta-indie demo album and live EP into college-radio nowhere. I don't care whether they're progressive and postmodern and goofy and smarter than the person next to you (but not you). And I also don't care whether they can play their instruments. Because they can't play their influences.

The hit vies in rank sentimentality with ""Candle in the Wind,"" hooked to a male groan also unlike anything I've ever heard. Subject: dead homies, a hard reality turned soft metaphor. The rest is underproduced propaganda for, reflections of, or fantasies about thug life that hold intrinsic interest only for live homies and their wannabes.

The beats speed up without losing their deep post-Cali bump, especially on the nonstop ""Make Em Say Uhh #2."" The artiste camouflages his rapping by passing work to his brothers and collecting chits from Bone-Thugs and Snoop. Political analyses are essayed. So the brutally predictable solo smashes by said brothers, the cold Silkk the Shocker and the crude C-Murder, are less fun. But they're also less aggravating. In addition to givens about social services and law enforcement, we get ""Niggas don't kill niggas--media kill niggas,"" ""why the government don't protect superstars,"" ""no Grammy nominations,"" and complaints that his taxes are too high. We get all the usual misogynist ugliness and black-on-black crime. We get Snoop calling Puffy out without going so far as to utter his name. ""The ghetto's got me crazy"" I know--that's the cliche P patented with his groan. But ""too legit to quit""? Where have I heard that before?

Back when he was one more nothing bandleader riding a chart fluke, there was something likable about Rob Thomas--something common, something dork-gets-lucky. Carlos Santana changed that fast, and with this album well into its second year on the Billboard 200, Thomas is now officially a menace. He's always emoting some new excuse with his not-bad voice, and he looks like he spends a couple grand a month on haircuts alone--a neat cross between Michael McDonald and Gregg Allman who'll be doing duets for decades. Next chapter: the solo debut.

FALSE,C+,Matching Mole's Little Red Record,Matching Mole,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2309,"
On the band's debut LP, never released in the U.S., Robert Wyatt proved his right to transliterate the French machine molle with the quavery, exquisite ""O Caroline,"" then guided the mostly instrumental album through what sounded in turn like Mahavishnu with a sense of humor, gently chaotic musique concrete, and the folk-rock of inspired amateurs. But here, in another installment of that endless soup opera The Curse of the Art Rockers, he changes keyboard players. The villain's name is Dave McRae, and I grant you he's not as highfalutin as Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman--this is avant-garde fatuity, very modular and/or atmospheric. Guitarist Phil Miller tries his best with songs about God and the initiation of a lesbian virgin, and Wyatt plays mouth and drums. But both of them let McRae take the album away.

Popular groundswells do vary in discernment, as students of jogging, nail care salons, and tax limits know. Like his homeboy and forebear Bruce Hornsby, Matthews jams politely. His instrumentation invokes classical, jazz, and bluegrass niceties. And although one can understand the deep-seated impatience with agony-as-entertainment his renown reflects, he's as bland as a tofu sandwich.

FALSE,C+,"Some Days You Eat the Bear, and Some Days the Bear Eats You",Ian Matthews,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7368,"
This is Matthews's eighth album of the decade (fifth solo), and though people still tell me he's deserving, I think he epitomizes the homogeneity of the new (country-rock) schlock. If the proof of his acuity is his covers of such songs as ""Propinquity"" and ""Blue Blue Day"" and ""Da Doo Ron Ron"" and (on this LP) ""Ol' 55"" and ""Dirty Work"" and ""Do I Still Figure in Your Life"" and ""I Don't Wanna Talk About It,"" the proof of his soft edges is that the originals are always more idiosyncratic.

In which Ian Matthews splits from Fairport Convention, hires a (good) pedal steel player, and sings like an angel. As you know, angels keep their intelligence discreetly concealed--no one would suspect that the song that goes ""Alright, everything's alright"" bears the title ""A Commercial Proposition,"" or that the drip who begs ""Please Be My Friend"" is off his rocker. The sobbing overlaid on Steve Barlby's ""The Watch"" does hint openly at irony. But what can the man who wrote ""Colorado Springs Eternal"" know from irony?

FALSE,C+,Band on the Run,Paul McCartney,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2687,"
I originally underrated what many consider McCartney's definitive post-Beatles statement, but not as much as its admirers overrate it. Pop masterpiece? This? Sure it's a relief after the vagaries of Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway, and most of side one passes tunefully enough--""Let Me Roll It"" might be an answer to ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and ""Jet"" is indeed more ""fun"" than ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey."" But beyond those two the high points are the title track, about the oppression of rock musicians by cannabis-crazed bureaucrats, and the Afro-soul intro to ""Mamunia,"" appropriate from relatives of the Nigerian children who posed for the inner sleeve with Sah and helpmates.

Of the seven cuts this doesn't share with 1978's twelve-cut, fifty-four-minute Wings Greatest, only the lost 1972 B side ""C Moon"" and the 1983 M.

""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" is a major annoyance. I tolerated McCartney's crotchets with the Beatles because his mates balanced them out; I enjoyed them mildly on McCartney because their scale was so modest; I enjoy them actively on ""Monkberry Moon Delight"" because it rocks and on ""Smile Away"" because it's vulgar and funny. But though nothing else here approaches the willful rhythm shifts and above-it-all silliness of the single, most of the songs are so lightweight they float away even as Paulie layers them down with caprices. If you're going to be eccentric, for goodness sake don't be pretentious about it.

FALSE,C+,Way Back to Paradise,Audra McDonald,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5328,"
Compared to Streisand, Garland, and Callas, said to augur a New Era of Popular Song, this two-time Tony winner proudly situates her big range and Juilliard technique on the far side of the chasm now separating Broadway theater from American music. Aficionados may follow the (satiric?) logic of, for instance, the sudden high note that punctuates the Adam Guettel-William Makepeace Thackeray trifle ""A Tragic Story."" But we who prefer our singing speechlike will figure she's just showing off again, which given the songs is perfectly appropriate. Ignorant of groove, eschewing verse-chorus-bridge, orchestrated to suggest the demon jazz only insofar as 20th-century European composition mooched off it, these are not tunes playgoers will hum as they flag cabs on West 45th Street. They are the sterile spawn of Stephen Sondheim and Ned Rorem, and although they signify little when sundered from their paltry dramatic contexts, serious they remain--what few comic moments they countenance duck their heads as McDonald prepares for her next octave leap.

FALSE,C+,If That's What It Takes,Michael McDonald,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8243,"
On his solo bid the El Lay soul man sounds like he should leave his therapist, not his group. He's feeling so hard the sense of strain is constant, as if ordinary romantic travails are driving him to the edge of existential patience. Yet despite it all not one of these common-sense homilies has the common wisdom of ""This Is It"" or ""What a Fool Believes""--there's a smugness about his determination to go with the serially monogamous flow. And I sure hope the next single is ""Love Lies"" or ""No Such Luck""--I'm sick of the rest already.

FALSE,C+,It's Your Call,Reba McEntire,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5892,"
There's no point expecting scintillation--even her new best-of doesn't have more than two-three zingers on it. So what's most irksome about this dull, bland megahit is what it says about the new Nashville. Reba has her pride, and ""For Herself,"" written with two other women, remains an honorable female-autonomy vignette even after you forget the tune (a good thing, because the song hasn't ended yet). But genderwise she's about as adventurous as Clint Black or Alan Jackson--just right for a world where Wynonna Judd is a protofeminist heroine.

Unlike his wife Faith, McGraw committed no egregious sonic offenses on his way to the top of the country charts, and given the kneejerk disdain Middle America elicits from my bicoastal cohort, I'd as soon leave him alone. But in a nation polarized far more cynically and effectively by the ruling class than the shallowest alt ideologue could dream, he has to be called on his love song to a Lady Liberty whose America includes no urban places, on his imperialist assumption that Mexico is for runaway spouses ha ha, even on his domestic bedrock, as if that's as socially responsible as rugged individualism need be. And then there's the matter of ""Who Are They,"" which goes so far as to blame ""safe sex"" and the replacement of ""what the hell"" by ""what the heck"" (I swear) on the owners of this newspaper (honest, named as such), called ""funny boys"" when he means ""faggots"" because ""They"" so decree. Fuck that. I don't much like how David Schneiderman treats unions, but I'm here to tell Timbo that my boss is a better family man than any damn country roadhog. ""I wonder if They like to fight,"" muses Timbo on his way to finding out where ""They"" live. Me, I use my words. If any Nashville thug lays a hand on me, I'll sue him within 50 cents of his ignorant life.

A waste. Vocalist Parker, an underrated blues pro, and organist McGriff, who has a name as a soloist but is better off accompanying, should produce a more than passable record almost automatically. But not when they're burdened with strings, insipid soprano choruses, and hopelessly inappropriate material. Is a bluesman singing ""The Inner Light"" supposed to make contact--and money--in St. Albans? Sonny Lester--remember that name--produced.

If EPMD's surprise rise was a revelation, the unheralded progress of this Bay Area rapper up the black album chart is a story in the trades. With his stolid boasts, heavy beats, and circumspect samples, he sounds like D.M.C. gone solo, but he's also got a local base, some new jack steps, and a video. In short, he's a pro as in product--already.

Old enough to know that irony stales on the tongue and dogged enough to notice when the songs peter out before the album is over, I'm less disappointed than the post-graduate pre-adults who were so tickled by the meta-faux hedonism of the Wesleyan duo's debut. After all, this airy prog-psych self-indulgence is merely an elaboration of the back half of that debut--the half I tuned out then but appreciate some now, because, even as self-indulgent elaborations go, the follow-up's a doozy. Last time they pretended they wanted to be frothy, decadent pop-rock stars. This time, with their best new one by far a praisesong for Brian Eno, they reveal that in real life they're wiggy, woolgathering dilettantes. Once they test the depth of the woolgathering market we'll find out whether they wanted to be pop-rock stars more than they knew. Given the tendency of unrecouped production budgets to cut into the royalties generated by one's hedonism, it's probably a good thing Ben Goldwasser's girlfriend is studying dentistry. A more reliable income stream than modeling, you bet.

Who has this boy been listening to? Morrissey? Anita Baker? June Christie? Harry Connick Jr.? Whatever the sleazy details, his announced decision to hold off on the dance music till next time half-proves he doesn't know as much about stardom as he thinks, and the ruminations with which he proclaims his seriousness finish the job. As a public figure he's no Bono or Boy George--he's a good-looking, replaceable teenybop idol. So only teenyboppers, and not too damn many of those, are likely to care that he feels demeaned by false fame. It's as a musician that he's won respect, and not even a pop musician--a dance musician. Ironic, isn't it, that the danciest thing here is yoked to (and undercut by) his highly unoriginal thoughts on this matter? And though the McCartneyesque ""Heal the Pain"" sounds like a hit ballad, most of this cocktail music is no more interesting than the cipher who sings it so ""well."" I'm betting it doesn't move a quarter of Faith's units, which ought to enhance his appreciation of dance music pronto.

It's going too far to claim that she's taken on a corporate personality--a very unusual individual does definitely peek out through the curtain of groupthink that hides these songs from the singer and from us. But that individual seems to have taken on so many advisers because she's afraid of herself, and such fear is not attractive in an artist of Bette Midler's power.

From anybody else, the second live album in under four years would have me charging unfair trade practice. From Bette it has me begging for intros--which rarely forthcome on a concert-flick ""soundtrack"" that plays better on screen than turntable. Streisand's claque is right--she's a sloppy singer, which without the diversionary shtick of Live at Last sometimes matters. On anything she's perfected in the studio, for instance. Or when she expresses herself all over ""Stay With Me"" or ""Fire Down Below,"" good notions that suggest cabaret may be her musical calling after all. ""E Street Shuffle"" she can handle--maybe because it has a plot.

Figures that a major-label, major-management band expressly obsessed with nuclear holocaust and man's inhumanity to man should smell slightly progressive, which I do not use in the lefty sense.

Some doctrinaire new wavers see the rapid success of this Jacksonville sextet as a reactionary portent, but as an old Skynyrd fan I can't get upset. They do boogie better than, let's see here, Missouri, Bama, Crimson Tide, .38 Special, Wet Willie, Atlanta Rhythm Section, or (mercy sakes) the Charlie Daniels Band. Really, they sound pretty good. Only one thing missing: content.

FALSE,C+,John Michael Montgomery,John Michael Montgomery,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5923,"
Nashville belched up the usual candidates for ritual slaughter this year, but most of them just weren't worthy. From ten-gallon wimps like Clay Walker to Village People rejects like Tim McGraw, the hunk boom of the early '90s is already playing out, and though Clint Black could have been so much more, in fact he still shows flashes even if he did check in with a Christmas album. This guy is slipping from lower on the evolutionary ladder and higher up on the heap. He took album three double-platinum on a bare-faced, two-fisted imitation of Garth Brooks, whom he has the gall to cut with Hank Williams Jr. Garth is great in part because he'd never give a woman a 10 or cap a well-reported verse-and-chorus about the hard labor of divorced motherhood with a covertly resentful verse about how the little lady needs a man.

FALSE,C+,Return of the Moonglows,The Moonglows,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7459,"
On the one hand, this revival of the great '50s group is obviously a money-making scheme. On the other hand, ex-Moonglow and Motown producer Harvey Fuqua has done a serious updating job--strings, after all, are the correct studio equivalent of the group's smooth polyphonous style, and ""I Was Wrong"" fuses the two periods beautifully. But there were strings in the '50s, too, and it meant something for the Moonglows to replace them with voices. On both hands, I'd rather listen to the real stuff.

FALSE,C+,A Sense of Wonder,Van Morrison,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5497,"
By marrying r&amp;b usages to Celtic mysticism in an art that honors both and then some, Morrison proved there was more to r&amp;b than even Ray Charles had dreamed. But when inspiration fails him, he's left with uninspired art. At his most automatic, Charles still has r&amp;b.

FALSE,C+,Mott the Hoople,Mott the Hoople,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7466,"
Despite the hype, these guys strike me as an ordinary hard rock combo. Their sameyness is not disguised by the melange of influences on side one--early Kinks, Bob Dylan, Sir Douglas, Bob Dylan, Sonny Bono, Bob Dylan, and Bob Dylan--and on side two this melange is quickly boiled down to its medium: sloppy hard rock with heavy leanings, big on post-Kingsmen instrumentals.

Mould-Maimone-Fier are some kind of supersession, but they're no band, and between the cello and the acoustic guitar and the moderato and the lyric sheet that ought to have a little typeface note like at the end of a Borzoi book, I find myself disliking their record intensely. Until the raving finale, it's so respectable, so cautious, as if honest thought were a suitable substitute for wisdom, sarcasm, a good joke, or a suicide run for the next intro.

FALSE,C+,Mountain Climbing,Mountain,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7467,"
We all know they're the original Cremora--what this makes clearer is that they're Jack Bruce's third of the jar. On ""For Yasgur's Farm"" Felix Pappalardi emulates JB's self-dramatizing vocal propriety as well as his bass lines, but when Leslie West runs an acoustic guitar solo from raga to flamenco without ever touching the blues you know he's not doing an Eric Clapton tribute. Can't fit the humongous ""Mississippi Queen"" into this theory, but I can tell you who wrote ""Theme for an Imaginary Western"": Jack Bruce and Pete Brown.

FALSE,C+,The Best of Mountain,Mountain,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7469,"
Mountain Climbing is the only album of theirs I've ever enjoyed even momentarily. This selects all of its enjoyable tracks and adds relatively classy filler like ""Nantucket Sleighride"" (heavy-metal myth discovers America) and ""The Animal Trainer and the Toad"" (one of two songs on this record to mention Beethoven). So I guess it's better. But it's not that much better.
"
FALSE,C+,Iaora Tahiti,Mouse on Mars,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5924,"
It's a shuck to apply the postfelicitous prefix ""post"" to instrumental rock, which has been a nothing tradition for a long time. In 1995 as so often before, chops were laughable, compositional notions paltry, big concepts quickly exhausted, and from Pell Mell to Eno/Wobble to FSOL to four out of five ambient comps to two out of three dance comps, the records weren't just forgettable, they were inconsequential. That's not true of this German duo, who care far more about details than their obvious godfathers Kraftwerk and at least as much as their vocal labelmates Pram. They may be quiet, but they ain't ambient--as background music, they're pretty irritating. Unfortunately, they're irritating up front as well. There's plenty of variety, and a well-constructed multibeat fantasia called ""Saturday Night Worldcup Fieber"" tickles me every time. But all this occurs within an aural universe that has little use for the lefthand three quarters of the piano. Its philosophical roots are in the so-called space-age pop that will remain lounge-rock's legacy long after joke bands from Black Velvet Flag to Friends of Dean Martinez have moved on to prostitution or website design--the vague sound/approach now reified in a three-disc RCA exhumation, a reminder that nothing released under the auspices of a major label stays incredibly strange for long.

FALSE,C+,Working Wonders,Judy Mowatt,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5511,"
The positivity of reggae's most autonomous woman isn't rendered any more credible by her brightly idealistic delivery--sounds like she's leading the community sing at Camp Nyabinghi. Her genteel Rastafarianism partakes of the usual fundamentalist delusions--she ignores Babylonian propaganda about Ethiopia, and she's sufficiently protective of her wonder worker's masculinity to insist that unlike those other women she's ""not up to any tricks""--without the saving grace of fundamentalist conviction. If you're going to be unreasonable, you might as well get all possessed and transported about it.

Hooking up with Imagination's Swain &amp; Jolley for hologram soul that takes advantage of her giant voice as well as their cushiony electrodance, she gives off all the right signs, romantic victimization prominent among them. I don't believe a word, even though I know it could all be ""true."" Maybe an aura of artificiality is the point--do I take Leee Johns literally?
"
FALSE,C+,A Little Deeper,Ms. Dynamite,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12126,"
If all beats are created equal, then Niomi Daley's spare garage is as strong as Kimberley Jones's thick hip-hop. If flow is as flow does, then her earned plasticity is as fresh as Lauryn Hill's easy liquidity. If singing is basically a matter of sincerity, then her straitened cadences express as complexly as Erykah Badu's high-flying scats. If conscious is enough, then ""Tell me how many Africans died for the baguettes on your Rolex"" will educate as deep as ""Black like the perception of who on welfare."" But good music isn't the same thing as a catchy feature story, and this Mercury Prize winner has less flavor than a plate of mashed. She's biracial and the eldest of 10 children and manifestly good-hearted, and when she goes ragga on the way out I wish she hadn't been groomed for something bigger and blander. But she made her choice.

FALSE,C+,Waitress in a Donut Shop,Maria Muldaur,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7476,"
In which a new '50s nostalgia, beatnikism, is manipulated to exploit reasonable doubts and fears about sex-role redefinition. No woman hip (or even tasteful) enough to love Skip James has the right to pretend there's such a thing as an earth mother. And if the production last time was too safe, this is what it was guarding against--ecch-lectic cliches.

FALSE,C+,Soul's Core,Shawn Mullins,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5331,"
Sincerity was smug long before irony was, and while Mullins devoted a long, honorable folk-circuit career to reinventing the feeling before he stumbled on his very own ""Taxi""--six indie albums in the trunk of his car and he could still muse, ""I don't know what I've been lookin' for, maybe me""!--I figure he'd rather be called smug than dumb or, heaven knows, insincere. Pretty good at observing/concocting the kind of composite characters journalists get fired for, he's so wrought up about their humanity that he rarely captures their humor or grace. That would require establishing a distance from them, and while they may live with distance, poor souls, he can't countenance it in himself. He's like a one-night stand who feels constrained to tell you he loves you instead of making clear why he finds you attractive. Feels icky, right?
"
FALSE,C+,Street Lights,Elliott Murphy,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7480,"
This time I can't blame the production--if anything, Steve Katz's understated hard rock and adept background voices lend emotional weight to songs that would otherwise sound hopelessly immature. Murphy's voice has always been callow, but whereas two-and-a-half years ago he came across as a compassionate kid who reached out toward the world as a natural function of this self-discovery, now he sounds like an effete young man who strikes out at the world as a natural function of his self-involvement. The distinction is less than clear-cut, and perhaps too sharp to apply to an artist of such laudable moral ambition, but anyone who praises someone whose ""wounds are open for the sake of art"" (ugh! what a line!) has never heard the one about the heart and the sleeve.

FALSE,C+,Danny's Song,Anne Murray,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7485,"
Murray's kind of pop must flirt with blandness if it is to be seductive at all, and this time she Goes Too Far. Conventional material is a big problem--even the title tune has been defined elsewhere, and by Kenny Loggins. In fact, there are a couple of live tracks here that have been defined elsewhere by Murray herself.

FALSE,C+,Keep on Jumpin',Musique,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7491,"
Just to reassure anyone pinheaded enough to suspect that I've gone over to The Enemy, I thought I'd mention this disco cult item, one of those tragedies of amyl nitrite poisoning that so distress sympathetic observers like myself. To start with the worst, half the record is devoted to a stupefying pop melody yclept ""Summer Love"" for 6:17 on side one and ""Summer Love Theme"" for 8:00 on side two. By comparison, the serviceable dance mix of the title track shines, and the headliner would be brilliant in any company: 8:20 of spare polyrhythm that never stops jumpin' and might be mistaken for the Wild Magnolias in the age of mechanical reproduction (except that it's faster). The problem is the title, which not surprisingly dominates the lyric. I grant that (""Push, push"") ""In the Bush"" is a phrase that sticks in the mind, but so is ""sit on my face."" I can imagine dancing to either in the heat of the 8:20. But would we have anything to say over coffee the next morning?

FALSE,C+,Sexplosion,My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5862,"
Disco-porn lite for kids who have so much trouble figuring out kink isn't sinful that they flip to the jive about how it captures the truth of male-female dynamics, patriarchal oppression, human nature, or whatever else feels-good-do-it. It beats S'Express's Intercourse, which must have been named after the town in Pennsylvania, but if you crave the real shit, sample the Lords of Acid's Lust. These Chicagoans are betting you'll feel more comfortable with a fake. In the '90s, when artists start talking both-a-parody-and-a-celebration, it's 50-50 the concept they can't put their finger on is exploitation.

Why is this the artiest of En Why's numerous art-pop bands? Because in their fascination with plectral interaction they eschew what makes art-pop pop, or rather, ""pop""--toons. Inspirational Titles: ""Europe,"" ""State of the Art,"" ""AEIOU.""

Snazzy guitarist turned decent-enough synth guy, the Spirit of Bebop Deluxe comes up with more dance hooks than Dolby--more even than Duran, at least on this U.S. compilation. And sings like Bowie doing a Jon Anderson impression or vice versa.

FALSE,C+,In Concert,Rick Nelson,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7496,"
Reassuring to learn there are constants in this changing world--a dozen years ago, Nelson was an inspired fake, and he still is. At worst this is a tasteful country-rock album marred by a mildness typical of the style and one too many Dylan covers. ""Hello Mary Lou"" far outshines any of Rick's four originals, but ""Hello Mary Lou"" has always been a terrific song, and I'd go see this band in a club in Denver any time.

FALSE,C+,Poor Man's Paradise,Tracy Nelson/Mother Earth,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7499,"
Jack Lee's three songs include one about how California was too hectic for him, and the only tune better than that comes from Willie Dixon, a specialist in the blues music a band of more or less the same name once played.

FALSE,C+,Tougher Than Leather,Willie Nelson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5530,"
In the end, I don't know what the fuck this supposed concept album is trying to say, and if Nelson does he should continue to keep it to himself--something about murder and honor and other romantic clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s. But since he felt duty-bound to write the thing, it does of necessity include a number of those modern rarities, new Willie Nelson songs! Including two that somebody el""Nobody Slides, My Friend"" and the new-cowboy advisory ""Little Old-Fashioned Karma."" Plus, for (symbolic) life, a rousing new version of ""Beer Barrel Polka""!
"
FALSE,C+,Without a Song,Willie Nelson,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5531,"
With music as subtle as Nelson's you wonder whether you're imagining things. Maybe we've just had it with his shtick--maybe a Martian couldn't tell the difference between this and Stardust. Then again, what do Martians know? Not only is Nelson choosing cornier material--self-serving schlock like the title song, awkward fripperies like ""A Dreamer's Holiday""--but the relaxed, let's-wing-it delicacy has simply disappeared. When he tries at all, he usually oversings, and he's finally hitting the wrong clinkers. If you don't believe me, compare this ""Autumn Leaves"" to Stardust's timeless ""September Song."" Or ask yourself whether Julio Iglesias doesn't sound right at home on ""As Time Goes By.""

FALSE,C+,Nevada Fighter,Mike Nesmith & the First National Band,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7506,"
This begins perfectly, with Nes fleeing the ""Grand Ennui"" (which I heard as ""Opry"" first time). And continues honorably with ""Propinquity (I've Just Begun to Care)"" (the Stone Poneys tribute). And then falls flat on its face with three vacant originals and a side of moderately well-chosen but extremely unnecessary covers. Nesmith just isn't a strong enough singer for such stuff--makes you think he got his gig through connections.

Newbury has somehow attracted the meaningfulness vote by patching bits of ""Dixie,"" ""All My Trials,"" and ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" into a new copyright called ""An American Trilogy,"" but don't worry, not everything here is so ponderous and thick with emotion. Not so ponderous, anyway--he's still mulling over that love affair, and he does get weepy about it. This is the new Nashville? Because his relationships break up in California?

At five million and counting, this isn't the rank offense its demographic tilt would lead you to expect--auteur Maurice Starr has positioned two exceedingly cute uptempo hits atop two overly balladic sides. Really, why shouldn't a black svengali mastermind the safe white r&amp;b ripoff for once? Funkier than the Osmonds or Milli Vanilli. As hip as New Edition.

FALSE,C+,Ys,Joanna Newsom,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13508,"
Original is one thing, worth doing another--and if only indie ideologues knew the difference. So much that is sprightly about the debut is subsumed here by ambition, to be kind, and privilege, to be brutally accurate. The through-composition does gain melodic grace over time but would mean little without the ministrations of Van Dyke Parks, whose fancy stuff requires simpler tunes than Newsom wishes to provide. And the libretto--ach Gott! Supposedly inspired by milestones in Newsom's life, these whimsical pastoral allegories reveal only that her taste for the antique is out of control. All those who gave this a rave should proceed directly to Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene or John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. The new Arcade Fire will only waste their time.

Nine great songs, three of them covers, including the previously unavailable ""Don't Mess With Cupid."" If I knew no other versions, I'd recommend these 1972 demos, but as it is Johnny sounds tame, doomed drummer Billy Murcia halting, Arthur out of tune (shocking!), and David perhaps halfway to the wit and assurance that brought this great band together.

Featuring the original lineup plus a tactful second bass and full of unavailable originals and covers, this live recording from their 1975 fling with Malcolm McLaren looks like a gem and sounds like shit. Literally: audio is maybe a notch above Velvets-at-Max's or Beatles-at-Star-Club, with David undermiked and the guitars buried behind Arthur &amp; Friend. What's more, the originals are all Syl's, highlighted by ""Teenage News,"" which he improved on his generally forgettable solo album four years later. For documentarians only.

FALSE,C+,Revelation,Joe Nichols,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12597,"
You have to hand it to jingoists Darryl Worley and Montgomery Gentry--they evince heart or hair. This bland, well-respected tastenik is neocon in neotrad clothing. Coding as cannily as Alice Cooper, he opines: ""There's nothing wrong with people singing about stuff they believe in, but to get up and give a political speech and give your political views and forget what we came to the show for, that's ridiculous."" As for hits bewailing Christ's disappearance from the classroom, that's just stuff he believes in. And the title tune, about sinners saved by a dream of the rapture, why, Waylon Jennings did it once. How tasteful do you want?
"
FALSE,C+,Why Should the Fire Die?,Nickel Creek,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13098,"
Of course they're still ""really"" ""newgrass,"" but mainly they're a prog-pop band accessorizing their chords with mountain sonics. One effuser goes so far as to claim ""a younger, better-scrubbed Dave Matthews Band minus the blowhardiness, a rootsier Ryan Cabrera,"" while a tradder fellow adduces Bill Evans and Debussy. For some of us, unfortunately, all those loose-lipped compliments are negatives--Kind of Blue aside, we don't even like Bill Evans. Nor would I advise any three prodigies to reduce a James Joyce story to 54 words and rather more notes. The young-prodigy-tries-to-love title tune is a winning exception, and ""Doubting Thomas"" intimates spiritual struggles that arouse one's curiosity. But like most schmoograssers they're committed to virtuosity for its own sake, and like most young musos they've been too focused on technique to learn much about how music interacts with life.

Folkies, I guess--front man Mojo on acoustic guitar, Skid on harp, washboard, etc. But with strange roots: the blues rant that leads off quotes both ""Road Runner"" and ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" as it rambles insanely from inspiration to inspiration. Mojo is definitely touched by something--he preaches like Jimmy Lee Swaggart in the devil's hands, gobbles mushrooms and sniffs turds, sleeps on your couch. But he also fucks your mama and your girlfriend from behind, solicits head from ""art fag hags,"" and for his last trick beats up some gal who must have had it coming. Some white boys just can't handle the blues.

FALSE,C+,Tragic Kingdom,No Doubt,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5939,"
Like any pop skyrocket, Gwen Stefani is video-driven, and so hebephrenic you know she unprotests too much. The production's as bizzy as the Ivy at lunchtime, too. But this act's real problem is ska. Since the dawn of two-tone there hasn't been a single band in the style--excluding the punk Rancid but including Madness and the Specials--that was as songful as its fun-besotted partisans claimed. When that hippity-hop beat is hyped up for postpunk consumption, its energy somehow precludes tune. Not that she could sing in the same shower as classic Cyndi Lauper anyway. But classic Belinda Carlisle is another story.
"
FALSE,C+,Return of Saturn,No Doubt,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2591,"
Gwen Stefani is forced to battle the perception that she's shallow because shallow is what she is. Like any human being, she has real feelings, but they run about as deep as her hair color and her commitment to ska, and wasn't it polite of me not to bring up her gift for the pithy phrase and the catchy tune? Occasionally her pushing-30 doubts about the single life are touching, like when she imagines Gavin Rossdale would make a good dad. But after five years, two producers, one Spin cover, and one lead review in Rolling Stone, the single Interscope sent her back to the salt mines for is the best thing on her automatic-platinum follow-up. So maybe marriage wouldn't be such a bad idea. No no no, not to Gavin--better she should land a really nice accountant. They have feelings too.

Nyro is one of those hypersensitive types--they're usually women, which says more about women's oppression than their gifts, though it pertains to both--who can't see the condition for the nuance. There's no denying she's unique--her jazzy pop-gospel synthesis is without precedent or facsimile. No denying that she's serious, either, and probably in a good way--dedicated to her vision and her craft rather than pompous or solemn. But for an unsolemn person she cracks very few jokes, and her way with words, like everything else about her, is self-consciously romantic. She was born 150 years too late. When she's on, her music can overtake you anyway, but there's no ""Wedding Bell Blues"" or ""Stoney End"" on this album--melodically, ""Up on the Roof"" dwarfs her every meander. The plus is on general principles.

FALSE,C+,Mother's Spiritual,Laura Nyro,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5562,"
Though for a long time Nyro's heartfelt commitment to solipsism blocked her access to the greater truth, the romantic generalizations of matrifocal ecofeminism prove as ideally suited to her moody style of gush as the pat improvisations of ""women's"" folk-jazz do to her once unique and still arresting swoops and changes. Now that she's not only a refugee from the city but a mom herself, she's created an album ""dedicated to the trees."" Of course, earth motherhood can be a bummer sometimes, so if she can get hold of ""a ship from space"" she'll take her leave of this ""world that cannot give."" Then we'll be sorry. Inspirational Footnote (to the line ""while hawks* destroy""): ""*This word is being used in its traditional sense of war consciousness and not in reference to the spirit of the soaring bird.""

Steadfast stylistically since ""Back Stabbers"" in 1972, Kenny Gamble's three-man mouthpiece ought to make an ideal best-of--if you dig Kenny Gamble. I regard him as a gifted pop demagogue--black capitalist masquerading as liberator. The oppressively patriarchal ""Family Reunion"" is the lead cut, setting the tone of a collection three of whose four sides are rendered unlistenable by Gamble's sermonizing and/or sentimentality. What's more, the O'Jays deserve him. Eddie Levert is the master of the soulful harangue, parading the trappings of emotional commitment with literally incredible showbiz chutzpah. When I happen to agree with what they're saying, or when an inoffensive lyric is attached to one of Leon Huff's greatest hooks, I like them fine.

Those who wish Afropop were more political should reflect on this avowed revolutionary's Fire in Soweto--first banned in South Africa, which is no feat, it then became the theme music for Liberia's Samuel K. Doe, who soon proved one of the continent's worst despots. And as with most protest pros, neither Okosuns's ""progressive"" music, rock-colored reggae plus ye olde indigenous rhythms, nor his ""progressive"" lyrics, which praise Jah and Jesus and ye olde African woman, have gained passion or precision with the years.

FALSE,C+,Tubular Bells,Mike Oldfield,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7561,"
A musician with the technique and formal imagination of Terry Riley or Philip Glass can create electronic keyboard meditations worthy of hokey adjectives like ""mysterious"" or ""majestic."" The best I can come up with here is ""pleasant"" and ""catchy."" Oldfield isn't Richard Strauss or even Leonard Cohen--this is a soundtrack because that's the level at which he operates.

""Why are you sad?"" inquired the alt-rock mag. ""I dunno,"" replied the former child actor d/b/a Palace and such. ""I guess I was born."" Admired for his reticence, sexual ambivalence, and general refusal of formal commitment, I mean closure, Oldham lacks neither talent nor originality, and up against some truly lousy competition this is his most melodic record. But to declare him a new avatar of Appalachian purity is absurd, not just because he's a rich city kid who can't sing, but because his purity is a candid affectation--a standard variation on late alt's agoraphobic cultivation of ineptitude as a token of spiritual superiority. Why is he sad? Because sad is easier than happy--almost comforting, in a chickenshit way.

What the Geto Boys were to the insanity defense, Onyx are to the irony defense. Not that they'd cop to it themselves. They're not honest enough, for one thing. And they're also not smart enough, which doesn't mean they're as dumb as they pretend to be--or dumb in the way they pretend to be, either. The official line is that nobody takes them seriously, or literally, or something--that not only are they obviously not nigga-killing, whitey-robbing, pussy-stretching bad guys, they obviously aren't pretending to be. Instead, if you're still with me, they pretend to pretend, greatly amusing those in the know with the old nigga-in-your-nightmare routine. So for me I guess they're something like Frederick Barthelme. Vulgar fellow that I am, I still prefer my jokes boffo.

In case you're interested, this band is mucho hot among Eastern rock cognoscenti (read, know-it-alls). Very pleasant, too, although John Hall doesn't sing as tasty as he plays. The only impressive song is ""Half Moon."" Anything Janis Joplin used to sing is impressive, so that may not mean much.

What a waste. With a bigger boost from his hustler-bandleader dad, who started recording Johnny Jr. at 17 and got Al Kooper to produce the lad's first album, this genius in disguise might have become a very successful studio guitarist. You get to keep meeting the stars, and if you're biz-savvy, ad work eventually provides a reliable income stream. Instead Shug merely created what experts from the High Llamas all the way to Tortoise agree was ""almost like a new style of music that could have developed but never did."" Given his vocal inferiority to AWB, Hall &amp; Oates, and the Brothers Johnson, this presumably refers to the funk-lite fusion experts from the High Llamas all the way to Tortoise have taken it upon themselves to defunkify, with cultural consequences not yet detectable.

I loved the title cut, too--on the radio--but this is not, as I had hoped, the auspicious debut of a new soul talent. Invictus is the Holland-Dozier-Holland label that represents their breakaway (as producers) from Motown, but this album represents no breakthrough.

Gone is the jazz feeling Danny Thompson and Terry Cox can insinuate so cunningly, not to mention the American songs, and I prefer ""In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida"" to the eighteen-minute ""Jack Orion,"" about a noble fiddler betrayed by his serving lad. Don't they realize that every verse of ""Cruel Sister"" used to end ""Fa la la la la la la la la la"" because in the olde days people had nothing else to do at night?

Young Blue Suede's Original Golden Hits is still in catalogue on Sun, and (for completeness freaks) his entire Sun output is available on three Charly imports.

Does he whine them in that weird, self-pitying child-drawl? Sure, he regresses every time out.

Anybody who thinks Jamaican music is all ganja and so-Jah-seh should check out this not-bad collection of soul remakes, produced by Kingston's answer to Herb Alpert, Byron Lee (whose own American LP, Disco Reggae, includes a slinky version of ""Shaving Cream""), and showcasing an accomplished duo of long popularity. Not bad, like I say, but nothing to make you jot down WLIB's Caribbean hours on the door of your refrigerator.

With their damn newsletter at 80,000 and counting, the growth of their economic base is impervious not just to criticism but to any eventuality that doesn't involve the breakdown of the American transportation system. So give 'em 10 years, and don't worry you'll miss something in the meantime. Phish isn't a classic two-guitar jamming band like the Allmans or those guys from Marin. It's a keyb-guitar-bass-drums quartet, its music dominated conceptually by the high-cholesterol chords and florid arpeggios of Page McConnell's piano. Occasionally there's a good song--naif that I am, I like the one called ""Simple."" But they've never put more than a couple on one studio album, and this two-hour live double is where they show off their base-building specialties, e.g. ""a mind-blowing 35-minute version of `Tweezer'""--which is actually only 31, praise God, and guess what else they got wrong?

Pickett's variation on the New Pretentiousness in Black Music is to progress beyond simple horn riffs into the busy little world of producers Brad Shapiro and Dave Crawford. As an idea, it's better than most--Duke Ellington did a lot with something similar--but in practice it's just about unlistenable. The nadir is ""Don't Knock My Love--Pt. 2,"" a fantasia for brass on which Pickett doesn't sing at all. But Wade Marcus's strings can make anything worse, and Pickett sounds as desperate when his interpretations are spiritless as when they're frantic. Best cut: a cover of Free's ""Fire and Water."" Hmm.

Though I wish this rewarded close listening like John Williams, Fripp &amp; Eno, or the Archies, it's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it--tends to add both literary and political resonance. With this band, aural resonance is a given.

Feature: ""The lonely, ever uncool, always corny piano man."" Bio: ""Liam Hayes's new record is not just about pop, it IS pop in the classic (circa 1973) sense of the term."" Wha? Has Chicago moved to another planet? (Again?) Hayes's closest relative by far is Palace Inc. CEO Will Oldham whittling mountain music down to a doleful whisper. If he's anything, and his aesthetic is so attenuated you have to wonder, he's cool, and if his aesthetic is about anything it's about being about. Hayes's snaillike, lachrymose presongs resemble no pop in history, much less 1973. (1973?) And while it's possible to imagine a piano man this anonymously self-absorbed, no cocktail lounge would permit him to sing--unless he owned it, I guess.

The most overrated underrated group in America. All of CSNY's preciosity with none of the inspiration, all of bluegrass's ramifications with none of its roots.

In the great tradition of Uncle Lou, here's a live quickie for you--four songs from the two recent RCA albums, plus a classic or two from each hard-to-find Elektra, plus the collectors' single ""I Got a Right."" You get to hear ""Lust for Life"" without the laff-a-line chorus. ""Funtime"" with anti-Semitic flourishes, and lots of irrelevant bombast and concert-hall echo.

Problem's not Bernard Edwards's textures or Tony Thompson's pulse. It's not the condescending concept that united them with young posers John and Andy Taylor.

Problem's old poser Robert Palmer, whom the Taylors thought a suitable Simon Le Bon substitute. Ask any Duranie: he's got wrinkles, and they're not as cute as Bruce's.

His seventh album (three admittedly reissues) and third live LP of 1970 leans toward uptempo countryish ballads rather than the usual pop-rock eclecticism and proves that he can remember the words without cue cards. I know that's the way it is--but is it the way it has to be?

The Fat Boys have had a reggae hit. So have the Bellamy Brothers. So why not a pop-funk hit for a black Brit liteweight? Catchy on jezebels and dull on world peace, he tries to shore up the formula with subtle touches rather than simple conviction, and back in Kingston, oldtime bizzers from Byron Lee to Edwin Seaga are smiling.

A Salty Dog had Matthew Fisher putting his two pence in, not that I've ever missed an organist before. And on A Salty Dog the Robin Trower blues was country and droll rather than technological and macho. And on A Salty Dog they didn't print the lyrics, which ought to end those silly rumors about Gary Brooker's intellectual attainments.

Because this was unmistakably the P-Furs and unmistakably a stone bore, I figured we must have overrated this band. No one ever accused them of having the funk, after all. Comparison with Talk Talk Talk and even Forever Now soon set me straight, however. Before slipping into chronic depression, Richard Butler intoned amid chaos--the dissonant drones that here parade by in formation detonate all over the earlier records, which makes most of the difference. And although this isn't as lugubrious as you first fear, speed also matters. Usually folks who quit drinking stop sounding sorry for themselves afterwards.

The howls of outrage greeting this album come from smart optimists who just realized they'd been had. In fact it's no more cynical than The Flowers of Romance, and since it does maintain a groove as well as glinting sardonically on occasion, it's also more fun to listen to. But that's not to say it's fun to listen to. Where Second Edition throbs and The Flowers of Romance thuds, this shrieks, with some of history's ugliest and most useless horn parts--including the one that ruins ""This Is Not a Love Song""--leading the way.

Johnny's gotten so tired and cynical he can't cut to anywhere new: no matter how hard he tries (and as a working professional he does try), he's stuck with his own ideas. Stephen Hague is a tabula rasa--when he does the Pet Shop Boys he seems smart, when he does Spigue Spigue Sputnik he seems false, when he does Erasure he seems blank. So when he does PIL he seems blank with a few harsh cross-rhythms. And if you consider it corny of me to pick on Johnny's electrodance record, let me observe that if he'd gone to Iggy Pop or George Clinton things would be just as bad. Maybe worse.

Nobody who didn't want money from him ever said he could rap, but he did have a spirit and a community, both now gone-one because it's harder to stay human on top than to act human getting there, the other because anointing Biggie your coproducer doesn't make him any less gone. Wallowing in otiose thug fantasies and bathetic hater-hating, hiring big names who collect their checks and go, he is indeed hateful if not altogether devoid of musical ideas. And for inducing a cute-sounding little-sounding girl to pronounce the words ""hit-makin', money-havin', motherfuckin' pimp"" he should be taken to family court.

For all his disco suck-ups and rock samples, this Houston rapper has gone nowhere, which I'm afraid reflects inept promotion or raw regional prejudice rather than the political consciousness of the market. His handle I tolerate--up against the but-then-you'll-get-caught glamourizations of an Ice-T, anticrime outside the law has its ethical attractions in a time of unpoliced drug war. But even in rap his contempt for women is something special--whether freak or whore or crackhead, the human detritus he means to blow away is almost always female. And first, if she's lucky, he will test his theories of natural lubrication, summed up in a rhyme whose accidental acuity shouldn't get lost in the cutout bins: ""I got the tool that she needs/To make her insides bleed.""

I guess what's supposed to make the psychedelic revival cool is that it's postpunk; secondhand purism like this suggests that in our negative age it's a positive statement to replicate the wimpy singing, wispy tunes, unsure drumming, repetitive guitar effects, and naive world view of, oh, Kaleidoscope, Morning Glory, Aum.

Sometimes selling out takes courage, and it's heartening in a way that Raitt, who's hardly immune to moldy fig, is willing to adapt her blues-rock to hookarama convention.

Not only that, I'm down with the right schmaltz, like the profoundly shameless ""Skin (Sarabeth),"" in which two cancer kids bald from chemo go to the prom together--a milestone, I'm not being ironic, if you're wincing you're probably a bad person. But that one tells a story, and stories aren't how they roll. Their specialty is advice and reflection hired out to professional homilizers--""My Wish,"" ""Stand,"" ""Bless the Broken Road."" These pep talks are anchored geographically by a track Jay DeMarcus and Gary LeVox, the two big-city cousins from Ohio, hand off to genuine small-town boy Joe Don Rooney, who longs for the good old certainties of a little place called, what a startling coincidence, Mayberry, no R.F.D. required--in a song that doesn't mention television once. As for hooks, well, check the Tom Cochrane cover. Arena rock didn't die, it just moved to Music City. You knew that. But Rascal Flatts knew it first.

FALSE,C+,Peaceful World,The Rascals,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7592,"
I was impressed at first by the effortlessness of Felix Cavaliere's evolution from white punk r&amp;b to white cosmic jazz. Only the Beach Boys have changed so much with so little apparent strain. Yet in the end the jazz musicians he's signed on--Fathead Newman, Joe Farrell, Pepper Adams, Ron Carter--aren't especially well-suited to popularize Coltrane and Pharoah and Sun Ra. And even if Felix were singing enough, he wouldn't be singing very good stuff--composition has never been his strength, and lately he's been thinking about other things.
"
FALSE,C+,Raspberries,The Raspberries,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7594,"
A clever label on the shrink-wrap smells the way people who make stickum labels think raspberries should smell, and the clever music inside sounds the way people who make stickum music think the Raspberries should sound--that is, the way people who go to music school think the Beatles should have sounded, with rough edges elided and lots of Chopinesque white-album flourishes. Worse still, the conservatory-trained goo lovers are apparently the Raspberries themselves. ""Go All the Way"" does so, and better pop-tight than country-tight, but not that much better.
"
FALSE,C+,Long Time Coming,Ready for the World,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8256,"
How long, oh Lord, how long? An official 47:28, which comes (as they say) to 4:45 per cut, almost every one a slow if not sluggish grind. And with ""Mary Goes Round"" insisting that sluts need not apply, 6:29 of ""Love You Down"" is all a good girl needs.
"
FALSE,C+,Mother's Milk,Red Hot Chili Peppers,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5810,"
Punks who loved Hendrix and P-Funk way way back, they're finally cashing in on their good taste, and though unbelievers dis their sincerity, execution's the problem. They didn't have the chops to bring it off then, and by pushing the guitar up front they sound even cruder now. But they're perfectly nice fellas, really--mention ""compassion"" in the very first verse.
"
FALSE,C+,The Ear of the Behearer,Dewey Redman,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15195,"
I tried, as promised, but except for brief snatches, many of which caught me in attitudes passive enough to approach the comatose, this has that fatal new-thing sound: noise aspiring to be music. Don't get me wrong--that may not be what it is. But it is what it sounds like.
"
FALSE,C+,Cookin',Jerry Reed,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11251,"
Since I am no country expert, this umpteenth lp by a Chet Atkins regular took me by surprise merely because I'd never heard of him. Competent-plus in the country rock mold of Carl Perkins/Bob Luman/Charlie Rich. Docked a notch for time: 28.58.
"
FALSE,C+,I Ain't from Chicago,Jimmy Reed,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7619,"
At his best--on Vee-Jay in the '50s--Reed sang with the languid self-assurance of a man who never ran for the bus because he wanted to spend the fare on a glass of wine, and the unindustrious shuffle rhythms of the Vee-Jay band ambled right along behind. Great stuff. Evidence: The Ultimate Jimmy Reed, a new Bluesway collection of his best Vee-Jay performances that sounds crisper than the competitive Buddah pressing of several years ago. This more recent material, however, is busied up with Motown bass lines and soul drumming obviously provided by upstarts who believed they could do better than back this codger. A few cuts avoid the problem, but the material is spotty anyway.
"
FALSE,C+,Metal Machine Music,Lou Reed,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2144,"
Lou's answer to Environments has certainly raised consciousness in both the journalistic and business communities. Though it is a blatant rip-off, it is not--philistine cavils to the contrary--totally unlistenable. But for white noise I'll still take ""Sister Ray.""
"
FALSE,C+,Lou Reed Live: Take No Prisoners,Lou Reed,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7622,"
Partly because your humble servant is attacked by name (along with John Rockwell) on what is essentially a comedy record, a few colleagues have rushed in with Don Rickles analogies, but that's not fair. Lenny Bruce is the obvious influence. Me, I don't play my greatest comedy albums, not even the real Lenny Bruce ones, as much as I do Rock n Roll Animal. I've heard Lou do two very different concerts during his Arista period that I'd love to check out again--Palladium November '76 and Bottom Line May '77. I'm sorry this isn't either. And I thank Lou for pronouncing my name right.
"
FALSE,C+,Martha Reeves,Martha Reeves,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7623,"
This attempted masterpiece doesn't make it because Richard Perry has failed the fundamental test of the interpretive producer--matching performer and material. To an extent, this is Reeves's fault--her gorgeous voice has trouble gripping complicated ideas. But it's also true that the competition for undiscovered song gems has stiffened since the early days of Cocker and Three Dog Night, so that even a prospector as wily as Perry hopes to dig one out of a slag heap like Vini Poncia. The strongest cuts here (""Wild Nights,"" ""Imagination"") have bene recorded definitively elsewhere. Which makes this the modern, big-budget equivalent of a second-rate Motown album.
"
FALSE,C+,Dead Letter Office,R.E.M.,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2919,"
Peter Buck describes these B sides and outtakes as ""a junkshop."" Dumpster would be more like it. You can throw away a Velvets cover or three without anybody getting hurt, but bad Pylon gives unsuspecting young people the wrong idea.
"
FALSE,C+,Lionel Richie,Lionel Richie,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8282,"
At least Jeffrey Osborne wants to sing like Peabo Bryson or somebody; no sooner does Richie split off from his unnecessarily successful funk group than he starts making like Andy Williams. Not that this comes as a surprise to those who know the funk group. But there are better ways to integrate this great nation of ours.
"
FALSE,C+,Sittin' on Top of the World,LeAnn Rimes,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8723,"
Not content to split the difference between Patsy Cline and Debbie Boone, this young teen and her in-it-to-win-it voice turn as grotesque as a mascaraed five-year-old in a beauty pageant. She begins by imagining a guy who ""worships my body."" Her Dad Rimes production and Carole Bayer Warren crossovers reveal Mutt Lange as the easygoing popster he is. She never cracks a smile, rarely revs a tempo. And in the only climax she understands, she colors in the ""Purple Rain"" so dark I'd say its purple was black if that metaphor weren't patently ridiculous.
"
FALSE,C+,Robbie Robertson,Robbie Robertson,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8290,"
Once established as an icon of quality, he always took himself too seriously, and age has neither mellowed him nor wised him up. So now, casting about for a contemporary context, he hooks up with the two most sententious young artists of quality on the charts. Took some guts for such an unrepentant Americana-monger to risk Anglophobe wrath, but unfortunately, the mesh didn't take. Because whatever you think of Peter Gabriel and Bono Vox, you have to admit that unlike the old man they're a) idealistic, b) singers, and c) at no loss for context.
"
FALSE,C+,Pure Smokey,Smokey Robinson,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15196,"
This includes the most audacious and appropriate song Smokey has written in years, ""Virgin Man,"" but otherwise it is better-than-average undistinguished, and like any other mortal he would be well-advised to get it together.
"
FALSE,C+,Flying High Together,Smokey Robinson & the Miracles,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7646,"
A dutiful, pleasant, and very mild close-out--I enjoy ""With Your Love Came,"" for instance, mostly because it starts out like ""Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever."" Easy to imagine better versions of the nice enough Ashford-Simpson and Wonder-Wright songs, and the champ adds only a Johnny Bristol piano riff to hits by up-and-coming falsettos Record, Thompkins, and Jackson.
"
FALSE,C+,The Greatest Hits of Johnny Rodriguez,Johnny Rodriguez,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7653,"
Fourteen big ones from the one-time goatnapper and Chicano Charley Pride, only don't get your hopes up--he doesn't have Charley's big voice (or Freddy's big soul, either). He does sound very country, clear and nasal, but I bet he's more grateful for his good looks and would be happy to turn into the Chicano Engelbert Humperdinck if the Chicano Tom Jones were beyond his means. And doubt that Humperdinck's within his means either.
"
FALSE,C+,Made in the Shade,The Rolling Stones,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7658,"
Six tracks from two of the greatest albums of the decade and four from two of the more dubious ones. Not the four best, either.
"
FALSE,C+,Love You Live,The Rolling Stones,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7660,"
As a Stones loyalist, I am distressed to report that this documents the Stones' suspected deterioration as a live band, a deterioration epitomized by the accelerating affectation of Mick's vocals. Once his slurs teased, made jokes, held out double meanings; now his refusal to pronounce final dentals--the ""good"" and ""should"" of ""Brown Sugar,"" for example--convey bored, arrogant laziness, as if he can't be bothered hoisting his tongue to the roof of his mouth. His ""oo-oo-oo""s and ""awri-i""s are self-parody without humor. This is clearly a professional entertainer doing a job that just doesn't get him off the way it once did, a job that gets harder every time out.
"
FALSE,C+,Sucking in the Seventies,The Rolling Stones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8304,"
C'mon fellas, it's not that bad--you didn't really suck in the '70s. Made a number of, er, classic albums, in fact. Sucking them dry for this hodgepodge is what sucks. As I'm sure you know as your lackeys laugh all the way to your Bahamian tax shelters.
"
FALSE,C+,Undercover,The Rolling Stones,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8306,"
What do people hear in this murky, overblown, incoherent piece of shit? True, they still slip naturally into the kind of vernacular specificity other bands strive for; despite the wind-tunnel mix Keith still sounds like the incorrigible genius-by-accident he is, nothing stops Charlie, and Mick's Texas chainsaw monologue is a scream. Also, two of the songs have political themes, which I guess is supposed to fill me with gratitude. But I'm such a churl I'm only grateful for good songs, and these are as tired and witless and nasty as the rest. Their worst studio album.
"
FALSE,C+,Don't Cry Now,Linda Ronstadt,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7664,"
In which whatever was raunchy and country about her is laundered in David Geffen's homogenizing machine, manned this time by John David Souther, who must have told her that ""Sail Away"" was just another pretty song. You think she's gotten so used to playing the dumb chick that she's turned into one?
"
FALSE,C+,Get Closer,Linda Ronstadt,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12067,"
Could be her, could be us, probably's both, but never has Ronstadt sounded more the art singer than on this painfully precise collection. James Taylor, of all people, saves the Ike &amp; Tina cover, and Rod Taylor, of all people, adds one more great ballad to her canon, but I suggest that she git while the gitting's good.
"
FALSE,C+,The Best of Rose Royce,Rose Royce,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8311,"
If Norman Whitfield had been content to concoct a disco trademark, they could have been greater than, I don't know, the Undisputed Truth. Instead he fed them, you know, ballads, exactly one of which is good enough for, let's say, Jennifer Holliday at the Holiday Inn. Leaving three nice dance grooves and the eternal ""Car Wash.""
"
FALSE,C+,Diana Ross,Diana Ross,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7674,"
The sound of young America grows older, replacing momentum with progress and exuberance with nuanced cool. Producers Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson provide all but one of the songs--they've written a couple of great ones for Marvin &amp; Tammi in the past. Unfortunately, the same couple (of songs) provide two of the three high spots here. And there ain't no high spot high enough. (Catalogue number: S-711.)
"
FALSE,C+,Everything Is Everything,Diana Ross,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7675,"
If I'm not mistaken (and let's face it, that's possible) this is an answer record to Aretha's This Girl's in Love With You. A little heavier on the corporate consultants, granted, but she does cover Aretha's own ""Call Me"" as well as several Beatles numbers and Bacharach-David's Carpenters (instead of Herb Alpert) hit. Blame its inferiority on the inferiority of her corporate consultants--and on her own.
"
FALSE,C+,Baby It's Me,Diana Ross,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7681,"
I've got nothing special against Richard Perry, although he used to find more interesting songs--and songwriters, which since he's now developed his own stable is more relevant. But even when he made interesting records he tended to push the epicenters of eccentric artists toward the middle of the road, and that's not what Diana needs. Her problem isn't her vocal limitations, although she's obviously no Betty Carter, but her blank taste. What if the best of the slick trivia here were combined with, I don't know, a good '30s pop tune done straight, a blues, something obscure by Al Green, something familiar by a non-Motown girl group? Might be worth hearing, and Perry could make it happen. Yeah sure.
"
FALSE,C+,Workin' Overtime,Diana Ross,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8313,"
How 'bout that--""an equity partner"" ""returns to the foundations of kids' street music,"" with well-known former expert Nile Rodgers guiding her every note. Which song means the most to her personally? Is it the well-named ""Workin' Overtime""? The even better-named ""Bottom Line""? Perhaps the revealing ""Going Through the Motions""? The answer is ""Take the Bitter With the Sweet."" Comments Ross: ""Every person and every moment is a combination of bitter and sweet, and that is what makes life so rich and surprising."" Thanks for letting us in on this secret, equity partner.
"
FALSE,C+,Skyscraper,David Lee Roth,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8317,"
In which the Van Halen parody of his debut LP gives way to the Vegas parody yeah-sure of his predebut EP. Instead of speed-metal, speed-Sinatra: while Steve Vai and Brent Tuggle make noises that once employed whole phalanxes of AFM members (brass and strings, respectively), Dave shares with us the wit and weary wisdom gained in his career at stud.
"
FALSE,C+,The Understanding,Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12933,"
Just as jungle tended toward soundtrack music for B thrillers in exotic locales, chill-out tends toward waiting-room music for plastic surgeons who really want you to order that butt implant. Where once these Norwegians were extolled for their subtle melodicism, here their schlock candidly attacks the jugular. If they're Air, Goldie was Tricky.
"
FALSE,C+,Back to the Drawing Board!,The Rubinoos,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7685,"
Live, this is a great '60s cover band--you should see how they choreograph ""Walk Don't Run."" Doing their own lame originals on record, though, they try so hard to sound fresh and appealing you get the feeling they're about to spit up on your shoulder.
"
FALSE,C+,Ask Rufus,Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7691,"
So Chaka's turning into a ""sophisticated song stylist."" Just what we needed. What she needs is sophisticated songs. They never learn.
"
FALSE,C+,Max,The Rumour,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7693,"
Because Graham Parker's songs take so long to kick in, I worried about coming down on his band too soon--until I realized that their songs already had kicked in, without my noticing or caring. The singers don't help the lyrics, the lyrics don't help the singers, and this is depressing.
"
FALSE,C+,Waitin' for the Night,The Runaways,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7697,"
This band surprised me live, nowhere near as willing to pander sexually as its publicity suggests, and Kim Fowley contributes his first decent tune since ""Alley Oop"" to the new album. I guess if somebody has to strike macho guitar poses I'd just as soon it were girls. But Joan Jett's inability to bellow through the wall of noise (she shrieks flatly instead) suggests that there are perhaps more generous musical models, for human beings of all sexes, than Aerosmith.
"
FALSE,C+,The Best of the Runaways,The Runaways,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8327,"
Ignore the sticker--if Kim Fowley had known how to make a Joan Jett album, he would have done the deed in 1976.
"
FALSE,C+,Hermit of Mink Hollow,Todd Rundgren,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3970,"
Only a weight as willfully light as Todd can be trusted to put his smartest song (""Onomatopeia"") on ""the easy side"" and his dumbest (""Bag Lady"") on ""the difficult side.""
"
FALSE,C+,Straight from the Heart,Patrice Rushen,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8328,"
Hard to believe this nouveau ingenue was once a full-time jazz pianist--forgetting ""Forget Me Nots,"" the whole first side could be one dancy vamp, and since in pop you're supposed to write the tunes beforehand you have to wonder how she fared when she had to make them up on the spot. Did a lot of vamping, I suspect. Granted, there's real songcraft on side two, if nouveau ingenues are your idea of real. I prefer side one.
"
FALSE,C+,Eternally Yours,The Saints,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7711,"
""Private Affair"" is the perfect punk-cum-early-Kinks song, ""International Robots"" invents a Jonathan Richman clone, and Chris Bailey should dub in the vocals on Seymour Stein's Wild in the Streets remake. But the lyrics are received protest, the tempos have slackened, and if those horns are somebody's idea of a joke I am not amused. The very idea.
"
FALSE,C+,Sakhile,Sakhile,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8331,"
When a black Johannesburg crossover band split up so they can ""grow musically"" and the bassist and sax player come up with a slack Crusaders homage, I understand--in South Africa that'll pass for progress. Here too, actually. But here I expect people to know better--especially record executives.
"
FALSE,C+,Silana Musango,Samite,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5940,"
It's hard to argue with the life choices of a Ugandan who lost a brother to Idi Amin. But when he opened for the gently ecstatic Samba Mapangala and the eternally vigorous Mahlathini at S.O.B.'s, he was a tragedy of ""world music."" Mapangala and Mahlathini, whose lives haven't been easy either, do what Afropop masters have always done: import American materials for their own uses. Samite is an exporter who treats music like a cash crop, adapting to the master culture rather than from it. On record you don't have to watch his drummer expressing her spirituality, and Bakithi Kumalo can flat-out play bass. But in any context Samite is soft-headed as a matter of principle--and by now, as a marketing strategy too.
"
FALSE,C+,Beer Cans on the Moon,Ed Sanders,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7712,"
Sanders has never been very programmatic, and lyrics like ""Nonviolent Direct Action"" are why. Even the thrusts at Henry Kissinger, Melvin Laird, and Dita Beard are heavy-handed. Believe me, I don't want the best song on the record to be about a robot in love with Dolly Parton. But that's the way it is.
"
FALSE,C+,Abraxas,Santana,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3101,"
On the debut most of the originals were credited to ""Santana Band""; this time individual members claim individual compositions. Can this mean somebody thought about these melodies (and lyrics!) before they sprung from the collective unconscious? In any case, they've improved. And in any case, the best ones are by Peter Green, Gabor Szabo, and Tito Puente, none of whom is known to be a member of the Santana Band.
"
FALSE,C+,Borboletta,Santana,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7718,"
Old Santana fans beware. Ad copy to the contrary, the only Latin roots here flowered in Brazil long 'round '66. Airto Moreira isn't Sergio Mendes, I admit, but Leon Patillo isn't Leon Thomas either.
"
FALSE,C+,Festival,Santana,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7720,"
As a salsa band they're still OK, but a ten-tune format and the sincere desire for AM proselytization don't make them a pop band. (Putting vocals on all the tracks might help.) It makes them a mediocre fusion band. (Is there another kind?)
"
FALSE,C+,Inner Secrets,Santana,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7722,"
It's sad when one of the few megagroups with a groove powerful enough to get it out of any jam resorts to hacks like Lambert and Potter for a hit. I mean, Santana is schlocky anyway. But Santana's own schlock has some dignity.
"
FALSE,C+,Surfing With the Alien,Joe Satriani,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5815,"
The latest guitar god calls up keywords like ""taste"" and ""musicality"" rather than ""flash"" and ""heavy""--not only does he write melodies (and countermelodies), he fuckin edits them. Thus he delivers both the prowess cultists demand and the comfort they secretly crave. That it surprises him to hear the result behind insurance commercials only goes to show how little guitar gods know of the world.
"
FALSE,C+,Your Daily Gift,The Savage Rose,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7727,"
Also known as the Copenhagen Rhythm and Blues Ensemble, this band has a knack for combining funky riffs with persistent melodies (borrowed from where, this ignorant American wonders). But though Annisette's multi-octave Lolita voice is certainly distinctive, I find her about as sexy as Yma Sumac, and as long as she sings Anders Koppel's lyrics she won't be any font of wisdom either. Last straw: a desultory eight-minute instrumental called ""Tapiola.""

Wonder how much Green knows about Immanuel Kant, who rhymes with ""Gaultier pants""--more than you or me, probably, and less than he should before he starts name-dropping. But thereafter he strives to right his arty rep. The ones that begin ""Gonna get that girl,"" ""I wanna get 'em girl,"" and ""Get you girl"" proceed as you'd expect, into a flighty funk of positively offensive banality. I always thought his pretensions were kind of fun myself.

Modes of integrity: Sedaka's Back, compiled from two-plus English albums, sounded organic, while this star-time El Lay session sounds homogenized. Neil's voice has changed--the light girl-groupy moments have turned bitchy and the sentimentality is thick with incipient sobs. Figure best-ofs are his natural element and remember that only if he goes away can he come back again.

FALSE,C+,Smokin' O.P.'s,Bob Seger,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7761,"
Zippy title for an album of seven covers and two originals--O.P.'s is Midwestern butt-bummers' slang for Other People's. But for some reason Seger has cadged songs already covered definitively by such other o.p. as B.B. King, the Isley Brothers, the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones. Both his band and his voice sound a lot more adroit than they did last time he was caught smokin'. But who needs 'em?

Slow songs about sex and medium-rocking songs about sex contend with slow songs about love and medium-rocking songs about love. Title, concept, and follow-up single: slow song about the futility of life. Just in case you think he's ""sold out"" or some such.

I had filed this as unlistenable until the amazing tuneout power of ""Roll Me Away"" piqued me into determining why. The songs aren't half bad--adequate melodically and with moments of good writing. But Seger's romantic individualism is a little simpleminded, more late-outlaw than Bruce, and it's suffocated by overstatement. Almost any country singer could show him how to approach a clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ kinda easy like. In fact, with his connections Seger could probably get lessons from Willie himself. But "

Seger has a brain--you'll learn more about revolutionary youth from ""Leanin on My Dream"" than from John Sinclair, who has a walk-on in ""Highway Child""--but you'd never guess it from his singing. He's one of these heavy guys who equates fake agony with real soul--wrote ""Song for Rufus"" to himself.

This is touted as the current Gamble-Huff sleeper, and no, that has nothing to do with her being married to one of them. It means that not only does it include two good songs, but that they come one after the other at the beginning of a side. Side two, in case you're interested.

Here's something you don't know how much you don't need--Dixie Chicks imitators. I do, because I also played the Lace album. The best-selling Osborn sisters have more jam. But although they swear they ""won't wear stiletto heels"" (unlike all those hussies at the Wal-Mart?), they definitely make nicer to men than Dolly and Loretta if not Tammy and Reba. Nothing in ""Still Holding Out for You,"" cowritten by none other than Richard Marx, suggests that smart sister Kristyn wouldn't dress like a slut to get him back. Somebody send that lovelorn lass a Victoria's Secret catalogue.

Driving through the Bronx on my way from South Carolina to Maine, I heard ""Lonely Android"" on the radio and wondered for a moment if the Ramones were making an art-rock move. This gaffe was probably a symptom of homesickness, but it does indicate that on record, where Annie Golden's Broadway proclivities are invisible, this becomes a vaguely interesting (or at least eccentric) band--Focus gone CBGB without chops, kind of.

The problem with the Japanese is that they don't know the difference between a Ramones song and a Wrigley commercial. But we do, or should, and these are Wrigley commercials, in which three lookee-no-touchee geishas do a good job of half implying that the supercatchy ""Banana Fish"" is a J.D. Salinger reference--in other words, that they condescend to American culture as much as American counterculture condescends to them. Unfortunately, the only thing that might make this ambiguity interesting would be musical dimensions they have no time, use, or aptitude for.

In the great Woodstock tradition, this gift from a flower (or two) to a generation (or two) is also a corporate boondoggle--a classy way for Warner Bros. artist Simon to rerecord, rerelease, and resell the catalogue CBS is sitting on. Paul has forgotten Art enough to relax as a singer, which means that much of the S&amp;G material has improved since 1971.

Given her self-knowledge and her fans' taste (they like her, right?), a compilation isn't going to get her at her best, though this does collect some of her more attractive melodies. Light a fart for the two big Jacob Brackman statements: ""Attitude Dancing,"" which means exactly what it says, and ""Haven't Got Time for the Pain,"" which doesn't, not quite--the most insidious let's-write-God-a-love-song to date.

Carly generally makes marriage seem both more boring and more nasty than I've found it to be, but not on this album, where matrimony is abandoned for more adolescent subjects. Even the two please-don't-cheat-oh-hubby songs--the better (and nastier) of them written by Carly's hubby--can be interpreted by her younger fans as please-don't-cheat-oh-boyfriend. In a way, this is too bad--if Carly were to come up with an interesting song about marriage, someone less conventional musically than Carly &amp; Arif might cover it and give Carola and me something new to sing along to. John and Yoko, where are you now that we need you?

With more effort than hedonism should ever require, I make out three or maybe four full-fledged melodies on this self-important, mysteriously prestigious essay in romantic escape.

If you hold your breath and are very good, maybe ""Kiss Me"" will prove a fluke. Maybe in the end it'll only be the innocent invitation to making out a deserving teen subdemographic craved. But don't tell yourself stories about biz or fundamentalist plots. Christians not proselytizers, they're an indie-rock success story who come by their limpid sound more organically than the Sundays or the Innocence Mission, both of whom they sincerely admire. Leigh Nash's clear little voice, like a young Natalie Merchant without the neurotic undertow? Her own. Matt Slocum's classed-up minor-key arrangements, like an acoustic Radiohead without the existential foofaraw? His own. They hope to create pretty, well-meaning stuff like this in perpetuity, for the sheer joy of it. Which means they could be nauseating urban skeptics for years.

Bio plays up their anti-""formula"" ""bad-itude,"" leaving open the question of whether any of these double-platinum Jerseyoid bar boys has recorded professionally before. Sounds like someone knows the formula: metal guitar plus amped-to-10 frontman times pop structure equals East Coast G N' R. Class animus is their excuse, the 9-to-5 dead end rejected for salvation by sleaze. Female characters include three hookers, a junkie, a classy bitch, a shotgun bride, a cheater who catches the back of her man's hand and the next train to Kalamazoo, and a crybaby craving ""more, more, more.""

From the clarion ""Treat Her Like a Prostitute"" through this bitch and that cocaine dolly and the fake virgin ""with a yay-wide gash"" and the one who meant yes when she said no and ended up marching a tribe of Indians out her cunt, this man hates women. His ballad is keyed around the refrain ""Don't hurt me again"" and is directed at all treacherous females, not just one. His anticrime warning closes with a convincing imitation of how bad you groan the first time you get cornholed.

Out of Squirrel Bait by Hunglikealbini, a Trojan horse. Extolled for their multipartite songforms and, da-da, dynamic shifts from soft to loud, as well as their intimate knowledge of mental illness, these guys look like unassuming alternative types and in real life may be same. Their sad-sack affect fits right in. But musically--structurally, as one might say--they're art-rockers without the courage of their pretensions.

One more complication in the Rod Stewart mystery. With Jeff Beck he parodies himself before he's established a self to parody. With Lou Reizner he establishes himself as a singer-songwriter of uncommon spunk and a vocal interpreter of uncommon individuality. And here he steps into the shoes of a purveyor of Humble Pie to pose as the leader of a mediocre white r&amp;b band. Best cut: Ronnie Lane's ""Stone.""

Makes sense that at this moment in history Al Gore's spiritual megrims seem so much more fascinating than Billy Corgan's-Gore might actually affect our lives.

I enjoyed the directness of this at first--piano improvisations striding over solid multi-percussion, in the spirit of Smith's former leader, Gato Barbieri, without the manic harshness.  Then I begin to hanker for some harshness. It's not just the strings, which are at least as intelligent as, say, Alice Coltrane's, and less ubiquitous. It's also the rhythms themselves, serving a purpose so expanded and cosmic that it's not even spiritual anymore, thus rendering their connection to the body irrelevant.

It makes a certain kind of sense to impose teen-macho aggression on your audience--for better or worse, macho teens are expected to make a thing of their unwonted hostility. These guys impose their post-adolescent sensitivity, thus inspiring the sneaking suspicion that they're less sensitive than they come on--passive-aggressive, the pathology is called, and it begs for a belt in the chops. Only the guitar hook of ""How Soon Is Now,"" stuck on by their meddling U.S. label, spoils the otherwise pristine fecklessness of this prize-winning U.K. LP. Remember what the Residents say: ""Hitler was a vegetarian.""

It would be a pleasure to dismiss Calvin Broadus's evocatively entitled No Limit debut as another piece of lowballing funk off the N.O. Bounce assembly line. But the lead ""Snoop World"" is the kind of track that can make an album, playing a synth-bass hook over a real bass line and under triangles and other high elements that never hint at G-funk keyb tweedle, and over the next few songs, cameos from No Limit's two best rappers, Mystikal and Mia X, clear the way for the unoriginal gangsta bull-roar of Master P and his brothers. But despite considerable input from Mystikal--whose deep-Delta bellow tenses powerfully against Snoop's honey-tongued indifference, adding moral weight to the usual professions of ""ex-drug dealer"" rectitude--the music soon runs down. And though Snoop is surely just a rapper now, he'd no more risk alienating his market than help a Blood's grandma across the street. Da game he's selling is sociopathic violence, and so he commits metaphorical murder, invites thugs to wave their gats in the air, cuts a biyutch improvident enough to suck his dick, and so forth. In short, he proves himself a born liar, showing all the imagination of an ATM in the process. Anyone who counts him a major artist because he can drawl and pronounce consonants at the same time should give equal time to Mariah Carey's high notes and George Winston's magic fingers.

""Do Right Woman"" is redundant, ""The Married Men"" funked up, and Patti Austin's ""In My Life"" just a dull song. ""He's Not Just Another Man"" has always been her problem.

Finally the answer to a question that's plagued me for years. I'd pound my pillow at night, drift into revery at convocations on fun, plumb forget how my dick got into my hand, wondering why, why, why I could never give two shits about Uncle Tupelo. But the answer, my friends, was blowing in . . . no, I mean hopes ""the wind takes your troubles away."" Name's Jay Farrar, never met a detail he couldn't fuzz over with his achy breaky drawl and, er, evocative country-rock--and needn't trouble with the concrete at all now that that smart-ass Jeff Tweedy is Wilco over-and-out. In the unfathomable Tupelo, Tweedy whiled away the hours writing actual songs, leaving Farrar the drudgery of mourning an American past too atmospheric to translate into mere words. As sentimental as Darius Rucker himself, Farrar is only a set of pipes and a big fat heart away from convincing millions of sensitive guys that he evokes for them.

He might have provided real songs after cut one side two, might have helped us believe in his ordinary blokehood by not putting the hotels he's trashed on a poster. Didn't really have to repeat the phrase ""kill my wife"" umpteen times (tell Britt it was only a ""very nasty dream"") or invoke ""Passion"" as universal solvent (like an asshole at a bar where the women are taken). And he didn't have to bury ""Oh God, I Wish I Was Home Tonight"" on an album no one will remember two years after it goes platinum. Vulnerable, waggish, rude, he begs his sweetie to save the best parts on her pornographic postcard for him. ""I haven't a cent,"" he adds, he's calling long distance on somebody else's phone.

But as we all now know, there's a backstory.  Band, check--Miami legends like Little Beaver and Timmy Thomas, with Miami legend Betty Wright calling the shots. But Stone isn't from Florida, she's from England, and the forgettables are covers too--the kind of soul marginalia Brits have been overrating since Doris Troy was on Apple. She's only 16, which explains the failed climax.

Nothing if not modest, less interpreter than pure medium, Strait lives and dies with his material. On this album ""Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her"" passes for a witticism, and while I know it's not saying much to observe that the Western swing ""White Christmas"" on his brand-new Merry Christmas Strait to You cuts anything here, would you believe ""Frosty the Snowman""?

FALSE,C+,Vicious but Fair,Streetwalkers,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7916,"
Artistically, this contingent of veterans is a casualty of punk; the stylized menace of their cultish, calibrated art-rock-cum-heavy-metal has been rendered obsolete by the outgoing explosiveness of the real thing. And although I've always been a nominal fan of Roger Chapman, it does serve him right--that's what you get for perfecting arrested-adolescent fantasies of sin and sexual warfare as your hairline recedes and your pot thickens.

FALSE,C+,Guilty,Barbra Streisand,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8452,"
Produced by Gibb-Galuten-Richardson, and Barbra Goes Disco ain't all. Somewhere in their success-addled minds Barry and Robin saw a chance to return to heartthrob ballads like ""To Love Somebody"" and ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?"" But after years of writing fluff--great fluff, occasionally, but fluff--they can't match that standard. Lucky for them Streisand doesn't oversing every time out, even floats some of the uptempo stuff--music of the spheres if you consider her voice a platonic ideal, polyurethane disco if you don't. But most of the time she oversings. And when she dramatizes a soap like ""Life Story,"" the mismatch is ridiculous.

A friend who loves this record offers the attractive theoretical defense that it unites the two strains of ""new wave"" rock minimalism--neoclassy synthesizer and three-chord barrage. So maybe it will prove popular among theoreticians. For the rest of us, though, there are little problems like lyrics that reduce serious politics to rhetoric, singing that makes rhetoric sound lurid, and the way the manic eccentricity of this duo's live performance turns to silliness on record.

They say this is the rock and roll of the future, which I find a depressing thought even though (or because) the amalgam is a moderately smart one. Straight-ahead art-rock, sort of--Queen without preening. Yes without pianistics and meter shifts. And ""Bloody Well Right"" documents a gift for the killer hook. Now if only ""Bloody Well Right"" weren't an impassioned plea for complacency. Maybe if we close our eyes they'll go away.

I like a hooky album as well as the next fellow, so when I found that this one elicited random grunts of pleasure I looked forward to listening hard. But the lyrics turned out to be glib variations on the usual Star Romances trash, and in the absence of vocal personality (as opposed to accurate singing) and rhythmic thrust (as opposed to a beat) I'll wait until this material is covered by artists of emotional substance--Tavares, say, or the Doobie Brothers.

In which the great pop factory of the '60s flounders around in the superstar '70s, incapable of fabricating hits around the greatest of girl-group trademarks. ""Stoned Love,"" from 1970, is the last undeniable single Berry Gordy's depleted forces can provide their act; by the time Smokey enters the lists in 1972 he's turned into an album artist.

The all-instrumental intro is the P-Funk horns as the Mar-Keys introducing Otis, and since Bootsy claims this light funk as his own concept quote unquote, don't blame George if Otis never shows.

Breasts barely budding beneath her rugby shirt on the back cover of Fool Around, she was a young sweet sixteen, but two years later she's no innocent--black leather jacket half unzipped, gauntleted hands over the face of her younger charge, she's seen one too many photos of Siouxsie Sioux. Only Siouxsie Sioux has a lousy voice--and Siouxsie Sioux knows what to do with it. A longtime pro if the truth be known, Sweet never quite connected as a new-wave ingenue, but there were nice tensions in the gaps. As a new-wave Linda Ronstadt--she covers Graham Parker, she covers Lou Reed, she covers the goddamn Damned--her only interesting song is one she wrote herself: ""Tonight Ricky,"" about how they're finally going all the way. It seems like an old memory.

This laid-back funk has body; it's physically attractive. And it's nice that T can put his own mild voice to his own mild lyrics like any other rock aristocrat. I might even agree that the candor of its complacency (one song puts down streetlights, another celebrates T's in-laws, the Kristoffersons) is refreshing. Actually, though, it pisses me off.

But though a couple of other songs here, notably ""Distant,"" indicate that their pan may flash again, late converts are advised to seek out the single and wish they could buy the disco disc.

If even his admirers acknowledge that his music has lost some of its drive (lost some of its drive?), then even a sworn enemy can admit that he's capable of interesting songs and intricate music. Having squandered most of the songs on his big success, he's concentrating on the intricate music--the lyrics are more onanistic than ever, escapist as a matter of conscious thematic decision. From what? you well may wonder. From success, poor fella. Blues singers lived on the road out of economic necessity, although they often got into it; Taylor is an addict, pure and simple. A born-rich nouveau star who veers between a ""homestead on the farm"" (what does he raise there, hopes?) and the Holiday Inn his mean old existential dilemma compels him to call home deserves the conniving, self-pitying voice that is his curse. Interesting, intricate, unlistenable.

This is no better than Mud Slide Slim (several good songs if you care about James's agonies) or One Man Dog (several interesting experiments if you care about James's ideas), and although it is better than Walking Man, so is The Best of the Cowsills. Basically a solid piece of singer-songwriter product--I might actively enjoy ""Lighthouse"" or ""Angry Blues"" if someone else sang them, and I enjoy ""Gorilla"" and ""Mexico"" now. So why do his devotees regard it as a heartening comeback? Because its desecration of Marvin Gaye has propelled it into the top ten? Or because they never cared about his agonies or ideas either?
"
FALSE,C+,Flag,James Taylor,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7969,"
What's wrong with most of these songs is that Taylor is singing them. He can sing, sure--the ""Day Tripper"" cover and ""Is That the Way You Look"" show off his amused, mildly funky self-involvement at its sharpest and sexiest. But too often the material reveals him at his sharpest and most small-minded; John Lennon might get away with ""I Will Not Lie for You,"" but JT's whine undermines whatever honesty the sentiment may have.

FALSE,C+,Eargasm,Johnnie Taylor,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7973,"
Taylor's commitment to the traditional soul style remains unimpeachable even when he accedes to material as modish as the likable but lightweight ""Disco Lady."" But to call him traditional is not entirely a compliment--he still lacks the kind of aggressive originality that can take a mediocre hook-and-lyric by the ear and drag it out of oblivion. Which is where too much of this album remains.
"
FALSE,C+,Echoes,Livingston Taylor,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7978,"
Vocally, Liv is almost James's twin but not quite--he adds a touch of depth to the lissome drawl and subtracts all wow and flutter. Since what makes James unique is also what makes him repulsive, I find Liv more likable but less interesting--especially given his songwriting, which this best-of, drawn from his three early '70s LPs, makes the best of. I ask you, what good is a funny voice without a sense of humor?

Bram's multitracked, overechoed interpretations of old-wave profundities like ""I'm the one that's leaving"" and new wave bromides like ""all these people suck"" makes him sound like a power pop Crosby, Crosby &amp; Crosby.

Of course Jack Black makes me laugh sometimes. He's got serious comic gifts. But the meanness of his joke band proves how much easier it is to act a role than inhabit a persona. I can imagine him playing a sympathetic character in a movie somebody else scripted. But I can't imagine him writing a song I cared about, even as a laugh, because he treats music the way his songs treat women--as a means to an end. What end, though? Getting laid is a snap, after all. Maybe just believing his life means a damn thing.

This beats Lighthouse (arrghh) and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (urrp), but with their intricate charts and printed music Michael Zager and Aram Schefrin make like they paid their dues in a conservatory.

The function of the catchy nothing-but-love-songs on this skillful but otherwise derivative slice of boogie is to enable Don Barnes to show the would-be hellions in his audience, all of whom have to betray their rowdy principles if they're to keep their jobs and get on with their lives, just exactly how a good old boy acts sincere.

B.J. might be the Johnny Rivers of the Leon Russell generation--he was born in Texas, after all--if only he had better taste. Some pleasant stuff complements the two great ones here--""Rock and Roll Lullaby,"" the hit, and the suppressed Carole King nasty, ""A Fine Way to Go""--but anyone who'd agree to record ""We've Got to Get Our Ship Together"" is in need of some brain-caulking himself.

The nadir of Thomas's art-song mode, which reduces music to a setting for words and voice, both exceedingly eccentric for better and mostly worse, and also--ironically, as they say--encourages the autonomy of musicians who like most musicians are wise to follow orders.

Tired of complaining about the problems of the world (not that anyone else noticed him doing it), Tom Bailey elects to add to them instead, with an English positivity album that's a case study in the limits of catchy--I'd pay money not to hum these tunes.

As a fan of this second banana, I'd hoped he'd earn his title. Unfortunately, no quantity of returned favors from such class pop-funkers as Kashif, Ray Chew, and Nile &amp; Bernard will do the trick for a man who not only doesn't sing as indelibly as pathfinder Luthern Vandross, which is understandable, but doesn't write as indelibly either. Best Chic song: the perky ""Perfect Lover.""

Those who whine that there are no new rock bands are too square to know where to find them--on commercial radio, they're as hot as teenpop right now. But although many of those that surface come complete with a winner like the sad-versed, jaunty-chorused ""Kryptonite,"" a sure shot for the Y2K'd and Confused remake Steve Case's boy will bankroll in 2020, good new rock bands are admittedly hard to come by.

I keep trying to find an analogy for the precious falsettos affected by this baroquely tuneful little band. But except maybe for that prepsychedelic Dreamer Freddie Garrity, none of the obvious influences--early Bee Gees, early Floyd, Strawberry Alarm Clock, Lemon Pipers--is insufferable enough. Really, fellows, the first time around this stuff might (I said might) have been fun. In 1983 it's likely to make a grown man puke.

Working on the humane assumption that all screamo records can't be equally horrible, the reviewerati have singled out this big-ticket effort, produced by Sleater-Kinney-certified Dave Fridmann. Unburdened by theory, however, I find that its distinction boils down to slightly subtler tunecraft and dynamic range. At any volume, Geoff Rickley still sounds like the kind of young man who, when they change his prescription so it doesn't upset his stomach, suddenly becomes more optimistic. This happened, he says, and while it's understandable, it suggests the limits of his political analysis. Romantic, too: Toward the end he's emoting at the top of his lungs about love like a carousel and 50 decaying roses. Takes things hard, does Geoff. That's why he became an artist.

FALSE,C+,Close to the Bone,Tom Tom Club,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8510,"
As a one-off, this band was a delight, with a big push from the riff of the '80s and the help of consistently sly and kooky lyrics. But in rock and roll, delight is a fragile thing, and this codification flirts with the insufferable. The simplistic tunes and sing-song delivery do no service to the coy credos of freedom, equality, and happiness they accompany, and there are times when all this praise of jitney drivers and four-way hips suggests the kind of irresponsible exoticism cynics always suspect when rich white people find the meaning of life in the tropics.

This spinoff seemed like a good idea at the time because a good idea was all it was. As a career alternative that lets them feel useful when David goes off on a tangent, it's product. The Arthur Baker-coproduced late-'88 stuff is arch, subfunctional dance music that transmutes ""Wild Wild West"" into ""Wa Wa Dance"" without the writing credit Sugarhill ceded ""Genius of Love"" way back when. The late-'87 is minimalist Europop, and in that it's not charmless.

Mysticism should keep its own counsel; boast about it, translate your supposed experience of the ineffable into any but the most simpleminded ideology, and ninety-five times out of a hundred you'll sound like a smug asshole. Tosh's ever more preachy vocal stance does nothing for his dopey puns (""shitty"" for ""city,"" far out), his confused political-economic theories, or his equation of hamburgers with heroin. And his musicians sound like the bored pros rockers so often turn into.

I've always found pleasure in Toussaint's hackwork and clucked sympathetically over his ambitious failures, but complaints about Jerry Wexler's conventional soul production here miss the point--it's Toussaint himself who aspires to conventionality. Abandoning the infectious, melody-shy chanting of his best LPs, he now sings with all the passion of James Taylor, which is probably as close to Glen Campbell as he can get. Auditioning for ""Southern Nights II"" there are various mild concoctions--I forget which is which, but the title tune could well be with Barry Manilow at this moment--that are not offset by several mixed successes and one reminder of eccentricities past. ""Optimism Blues"" indeed.

No matter whose top forty Lenny Williams makes, this isn't a soul, funk, or r&amp;b band--the arrangements are simply too complex. It's more a stripped-down (no trombones except for guest shots) big band in the era of Doc Severinsen. Compare to any Basie edition and you will hear written charts that sound spontaneous, not to mention estimable soloists and Basie himself.

Shorn of the voice-overs and bad dialogue designed to make the ""dramatic"" version as explicit as multileveled self-referentiality can be, what I'd dreamed might be his sparest, strongest, sweetest set of songs in years turns out to have needed all the camouflage it could get. It's long been evident that what turned Tornshend on about pop art was the art rather than the pop--he didn't want to drag opera down to rock's level, he wanted to raise rock to opera's. In practice, this means he has a fatal weakness for long synth intros. After the jagged surprises of the lead ""English Boy,"" there are far fewer intelligent moments than a guy this intelligent out to keep in his back pocket. If he's so damn worried about the postinformation age, it's because he's in the information business and is afread of getting left behind. And he damn well should be.

Their knack for songwriting always surprises me, because they deserve worse, and on this album they provide it, drenching their material in the grandiose harmonies and pomprock keyboard textures that thrive in the Midwest, where many poor souls still regard these transparent cynics as avatars of the new wave.

Encouraged by ""a black friend"" (Uncle Remus?) to ""let this r&amp;b music out,"" these soulful California cats did their professional best to simulate a Journey album. Well, all right, not quite--Journey's never sublimated misogyny into a hit single about sex emporiums, nor induced Maurice White to advocate cunt-lapping, nor essayed a Captain Beefheart imitation, nor risked an all-percussion extravaganza ""inspired by Sandy Nelson,"" nor closed off with an ambiguous comment from a black friend that I hope will make Tubes fans wonder who's got the inside track in any racial crossover.

The problem with Tanya's crossover is her functional but rather tiny brain--if only she had some real idea of exactly what she wanted to become, her pipes would put it across. Despite the heavy hoopla, the rock move here comprises three of the '50s classes that have always been her meat, and all that distinguishes this from earlier MCA Tanya is that Jerry Goldstein, her new intellectual adviser, has contributed three unusually bad songs.

Twilley's first two albums were marginally fascinating because of how obsessively he synthesized the Southern and British pop-rock traditions--like a cool Alex Chilton, or (only we didn't know this yet) a Nick Lowe who worked too hard--and because so few bands were bothering with the kind of catchy '60s-AM songs that Twilley turned out by the half dozen. Well, scratch the catchy part--both the Records and the Knack, to stick to the lightweights, have songs on the radio that cut anything on Sincerely, which is a lot catchier than this. And while you're at it, scratch Phil Seymour, Twilley's former rhythm section and harmony group. And add Jimmy Haskell doing Paul Buckmaster imitations. And think dark thoughts about the Raspberries and Eric Carmen.

FALSE,C+,Me Against the World,2Pac,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7,"
Tough-guy sentimentality is an old story in American culture, but self-pity this rank is usually reserved for teen romances and tales of brave avant-gardists callously rejected by the mass media. His I-love-Mom rings true because Mom was no saint, and his respect for old G's seems genuine, probably because they told him how smart he was. But whether the metaphor be dead homies or suicide threat, the subtext of his persecution complex is his self-regard. What's doubly galling is that these are essential hip hop themes--as Ice Cube and B.I.G. have made all too vivid, it is persecution that induces young black men to kill each other and themselves. That such themes should rise to the top of the charts with this witless exponent of famous-for-being-famous is why pop fans decry the mass media.

Americans enticed by talk of ""rock""-dance fusion should bear in mind the cultural deprivation of our siblings across the sea. Befuddled by the useless ""rock""-""pop"" distinction, they believe ""rock"" is something that happened in the '70s. The more inquisitive among them are aware of Pearl Jam and Nirvana, but if they've ever heard of Los Lobos or Husker Du they probably think they're ""pop."" So check out these comparisons from admirers of this inflated trio, spawned by the famously bad new-romantic band Freur and an ""art collective"" others might call an advertising agency: ""pre-stadium Simple Minds,"" ""way beyond the length of a Frank Zappa guitar solo,"" ""J.J. Cale on an ecstasy comedown,"" ""a warm bath."" Plus their proper predecessors Pink Floyd ""with bigger bass sounds and better drum patterns."" Here and there--eight minutes into ""Kiteless,"" for instance--they do work up a dangerously off-kilter groove. But the lyrics of Animals were more than ""insane ramblings"" or ""the colours of cars going past a friend's house."" And Ummagumma had more purity of purpose.

FALSE,C+,Boy,U2,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4059,"
Their youth, their serious air, and their guitar sound are setting a small world on fire, and I fear the worst. No matter where they're starting off--not as big as Zep, maybe, but not exactly on the grunge circuit either--their echoey vocals already teeter on the edge (in-joke) of grandiosity, so how are they going to sound by the time they reach the Garden? What kind of Christian idealists lift their best riff from PIL (or from anywhere at all)? As bubble-headed as the teen-telos lyrics at best. As dumb as Uriah Heep at worst.

Not counting ""Superstar"" and ""Until You Come Back to Me,"" which perish in the tragic flood of feeling that finishes this album off, the only songs here that might conceivably survive without their support system are ""I'll Let You Slide,"" which Luther lets slip, and the one that donates its title to the venture. Nor does Luther augment the support system's golden-voiced rep by sharing ""How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye"" with Dionne Warwick, who cuts him from here to Sunday. In short, he sounds like an ambitious backup singer.

Never let it be said that popular styles don't evolve--in the wake of Kiss and Boston, this is heavy metal that's pure, fast, and clean. No mythopoeia, no bombast, and even the guitar features are defined as just that. So how come formalists don't love the shit out of these guys? Not because they're into dominating women, I'm sure.

Better her closely observed recent songs than a tale of brave Ulysses or a lover with ""hands of raining water"" (wet yes, hot no). But close observation is still Creative Writing, and if Vega eventually graduates to, say, the flat command of Ann Beattie, she'll still be precisely nowhere. Real pop lyrics ignore such strictly literary alternatives altogether.

The reason these Aussies saved neither Capitol Records nor rock and roll isn't this duff follow-up. It's their duff debut. Inferior to not just Nirvana but Oasis, led by a spoiled jerk who can't sing the lyrics he can't write, and of negligible musical interest beyond the stray hook, they demonstrated the biz's conceptual bankruptcy by parlaying a fluke hit into brief next-big-thingdom.

First time out they sounded so original musically that I made it a spiritual exercise to forgive Gordon Gano his bad personality. But everything you might hum along with on the sequel was invented generations ago by better men than he.

Last time he was an urban romantic with a good eye who you would have figured for a Ferlinghetti fan if you'd thought about it. This time he begins to sound like a Ferlinghetti imitator, and while nostalgia for past bohemias sure beats nostalgia for past wars, it's still a drain and a drag. I mean, there might be more coverable songs here if maudlin melodies didn't merge with neon imagery in the spindrift dirge of the honky-tonk nicotine night. Dig?

Stopped playing so fast, hoo boy. And most important, switched vocalists from Nick Cave imitator to Rufus Wainwright imitator. Wainwright makes up better melodies with a dick in his mouth, and not only that, Cave has more literary ability. New York scene or (hint hint) no New York scene, DreamWorks isn't buying.

Well, ""Second Hand Store"" is fairly likable, but keep it to yourself--a follow-up would ruin everything. ""Life's Been Good"" is not only Summer Song '78, it was born to be a novelty one-shot, and that it happens to say more about the tribulations of stardom than all the concept albums ever devised on the subject just goes to show how deeply significant AM radio can be.

I actually found myself paying attention to the dialogue on this soundtrack, a first, though I didn't ask for seconds. It's pretty coherent musically, too.

""Hasbrook Heights"" is no ""Walk On By,"" but it is an ambitious, honest song about the pleasures of the suburbs, where her chosen audience resides. Unfortunately, it's outnumbered by ambitious, dishonest songs directed at the same audience. Whether Hal David takes care of the liberal pieties himself (""Be Aware"") or passes them along from Jacques Brel (""If We Only Have Love"") and Lesley Duncan (""Love Song""), he's selling lies so blatant and boring that even his chosen audience must know it. And while Burt Bacharach's four arrangements (unlike those of Bob James and Don Sebesky, who get three each) are more tart and surprising than ever, too often he underlines ""meaning"" with the little dramatic touches of someone who'd like to get into something classier than the record business, like the Broadway stage.

The only thing he isn't is a compelling artist. He can't sing at all, can't write much, and still pretends the bass solo is a viable musical form. Like fIREHOSE (sic), like his name-dropping solo debut, this ""punk rock opera"" (""I just hate the words 'concept record.' That's fucking tired-ass, where opera's funny"") looks great on paper and hasn't been played for a year by anyone it impressed.

It's to the half-credit of these Bucks County wise guys that the studio amenities of their major-label debut impel them toward fucked-up sounds, which come hard, rather than fucked-up songs, which they write without thinking (and how). But I don't buy the claim that they'll do anything for a laugh. Ever since they went on about pussy for nine minutes (good idea) in a Princey blues-minstrel drawl (bad one), I've assumed they were the kind of rec-room gigglefritzes who enjoy a good nigger joke when they're sure their audience is sophisticated enough to enjoy it.

It should surprise no one who's kept an eye on Weir over the years that he manifests himself here as an El Lay country-rock crooner with studio-duperstar backup. But I bet thousands of Dead heads are lying to themselves about it right now, while at the same time Dead haters equate him with Richie Furay and Michael Murphey. Predictably, Weir is better--funnier, more feeling, harder to predict. But how much better can an E. L. c.-r. c. be?

His two previous albums having slipped precipitously (last one didn't even make top hundred), White here recoups by hiring out the songwriting and acceding to such fads (in a style he damn near created) as the ticking cymbal and the tocking horn chart.

Because he sticks to his roots, White has those who don't trust rock-as-art all hot and bothered. Well, I don't trust rock-as-art myself, but I don't trust these bayou set pieces either. White's tales of spiders, widders, conjure wimmin, and wayward rich girls all sound like I've seen them on television, only there they had endings. Nor do the Otis Redding and Junior Walker covers teach me anything new. The John Lee Hooker is better. As are ""Save Your Sugar for Me,"" about teenage sex, and ""Stockholm Blues,"" about a songwriter from the bayous who goes somewhere in an airplane.

The age of AIDS hasn't left him untouched--he takes his women one at a time and indulges in telephone sex. But usually Junior comes on like such a wild-ass that you can only tell him from the average rapper by his primitive sense of rhythm and his failure to mention the size of his dick. Last album was called Born To Boogie, this one features Gary Rossington in Skynyrd simulations that top Skynyrd's own, and the CMA is so desperate to stay up-to-dately in-the-tradition that it keeps kissing his ass. Not that ""If the South Woulda Won"" can be said to go against the Nashville grain--nobody really wants to go back to slavery, understand, but if that's the price of more hangings and no more foreign cars, we may have to bite the bullet. Anyway, Hank drops in a good word for Martin Luther King on the very next song. How much do these people want?

His first single, ""Shoo Doo Fu Fu Ooh,"" was a young singer's whoop of triumph from the top of the world. It seemed to promise many more. But after three mediocre LPs--the first still the best--I've given up. Williams's subsequent tries at simple, ecstatic black pop have sounded like expert imitations, and most of the time he's just a love man, doing his best to shore up songs that were made to be broken.

Classy arena-rock, that's what, redolent at its best of his fellow studio obsessives in Steely Dan, only never as smart, and at its worst more like REO Speedwagon. His radio-ready arrangements, hired lyrics, and funk borrowings are all hallmarks of the most venal popular music of the age, and that his synthesizer moves were slightly ahead of their time doesn't make them an iota less annoying.

The playing (not much feedback) is better than the vocals is better than the songs, and on the whole it's pretty dumb.

FALSE,C+,Neil Young and the Shocking Pinks/Everybody's Rockin',Neil Young,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2526,"
If Ronnie and Nancy are the only everybodies rockin' by name on the less than rousing title finale, then maybe what Neil means to say is that basic rockabilly isn't worth too much all by its lonesome. I agree, but expect the argument would be more convincing if Neil plus Ben Keith could match Brian Setzer chop for chop. The covers are redundant or worse, as are all but two of the originals. I hope Robert Gordon or somebody rescues ""Kinda Fonda Wanda."" And I hope Neil realizes that for all the horrible truth of ""Payola Blues,"" nobody's three thou's gonna get this on top forty.

FALSE,C+,Landing on Water,Neil Young,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2528,"
Hidden away on this rock bellyflop (which must be scandalizing 'em in Nashville) are hints that he may still be a crazed genius--the hook on the otherwise more-than-predictable ""Drifter,"" the urban neurosis of ""Pressure,"" and especially the broken yet still encouraging ""Hippie Dream."" But from straightforward confessional to brand-new drummer, it's the dullest record he's ever made.
"
FALSE,C+,Silver and Gold,Neil Young,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2541,"
Previously, Young's bad records have always had the mark of weirdness on them--impossible songs, twisted politics, stupid clothes. These 10 well-culled copyrights, two from the '80s and only four from 2000, are something new and ominous, because they're dull. They smell of equine methane: the old-fart hegemony that fuels alt-country, AC radio, and literary anthologies canonizing Ry Cooder, Ernie K-Doe, and Spooner Oldham. So though Duck Dunn and Jim Keltner get more beats going than Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina ever will, their mild funk is just another species of roots politesse, and Neil's self-indulgently halting vocals open the dismaying possibility that he takes Will Oldham seriously. True love isn't this boring, Young must know that. Hell, the Buffalo Springfield weren't this boring either. But they are now.

FALSE,C+,Elephant Mountain,The Youngbloods,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10870,"
C is for chi-chi. In the manner of tight groups, the Youngbloods stretch thinner all the time. Not only have they lost Jerry Corbitt, but their own expertise has become somehow attenuated. Banana used to be the most tasteful electric pianist in rock. Now he has become so tasteful he can sounds like Roy Kral on a lazy night. This is a bad week for personnel listings--down a notch.

""More Bounce to the Ounce,"" exactly. Like Bootsy's other funk alternative, Roger Troutman is a bit light--even when he grooves rather than croons he bounces rather than whomps. What makes him a smash with the black audience where the Sweat Band is barely a swoosh is his drolly mechanical detachment--especially when he turns on the vocoder, he could be Gary Numan with ants in his pants, or Kraftwerk on the one.

FALSE,C+,Chunga's Revenge,Frank Zappa,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8191,"
Like Bobby Sherman, Zappa is a selfish exploiter of popular taste. That Bobby Sherman wants to make money while Zappa wants to make money and emulate Varese is beside the point--if anything, Zappa's aestheticism intensifies his contempt for rock and its audience. Even Hot Rats, his compositional peak, played as much with the moods and usages of Muzak as with those of rock and roll. This is definitely not his peak. Zappa plays a lot of guitar, just as his admirers always hope he will, but the overall effect is more Martin Denny than Varese. Also featured are a number of ""dirty"" jokes.

FALSE,C+,One Size Fits All,Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8197,"
Zappa's music has gotten a little slicker rhythmically--which is what happens when you consort with jazz guys--but basically it's unchanged. And his satire has neither improved nor deteriorated--if his contempt would be beneath an overbright high school junior, there's also a brief lieder parody that I'd love to jam onto WQXR. What's changed is the tastes of his erstwhile lionizers--they've gotten bored with his repertoire of stylistic barbarities. Us smart people just got bored faster.

Touring the way this band does tears you up by the roots, until the digs at Rolling Stone assume an authenticity lacking in the tales of the Pan-Am Highway. But this is the first trio to hark back to country music as well as blues, and they're brawnier than anything that comes out of Austin. You think Kinky Friedman will cover ""Arrested for Driving While Blind""?

The megabuck stops here. Maybe I'll let Bruce Springsteen teach me how to hear John Cougar Mellencamp, but damned if I'm going to let John Cougar Mellencamp teach me how to hear Bryan Adams. From antipunkdiscowave strut to Flashdance homage, he's a generic American hunk, only whiter because he's Canadian. Where Sammy Hagar flaunts his anticommunism and Don Henley flaunts his mouth, Adams flaunts nothing more and nothing less than his young reliable bod. Like all the above-mentioned good and bad he shares a mysterious nostalgia for the recent past with a lot of people who aren't half dead yet, at least chronologically. And more than any of them he has real problems relaxing, which puts him square in the soul-as-will-and-idea tradition of Lou Gramm, Pat Boone, Sophie Tucker, and so many others.

FALSE,C-,Seed,Afro Celts,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12192,"
Another U.K. band Americans don't need--musically, we're all Afrocelts, and uilleann pipes have nothing to do with it. Not that they have much to do with this oleaginous fusion unit, where a predictable surfeit of Celts--or at least white people, given headman Simon Emmerson's highly Anglo-Saxon surname--have long favored electronics and such pan-world signifiers as bouzouki, tabla, and flamenco guitar. Right, the aim is spiritual deep down--a way for Wiccans who only go to church on Halloween to get in touch with their inner shamans. So two Africans beat their ""tribal drums,"" as one admiring review ID'd them, while Emmerson and a late Pogue and a formerly Gaelic-only vocalist position themselves alongside a kora player whose hometown in Guinea has been electrified by a portion of their earnings. Next they should chip in some samplers. Music may come of this yet.

Quite aware that I don't qualify as a pubescent female, I tried to be understanding. It's not their fault they're blond, after all--they're Norwegian. But though they'd clearly have been better off raised closer to the blues--in Wales, say--the gutturals of fellow Scandinavians from Gasolin' to the Nomads suggest that their precious Yes-gone-Europop accents are chosen freely.

Randy Newman once described ""A Horse With No Name"" as ""this song about a kid who thinks he's taken acid,"" and at least back then they were domesticating CSNY instead of CSN. More tuneful than Seals &amp; Crofts but with less to say, which they've managed to conceal by establishing meaningless highschool verse as a pop staple, they might be remembered as the '70s answer to the Association if they could come up with one song half as lively as ""Windy"" or ""Along Comes Mary.""

The art-rock Foreigner is a find--rare that a big new group is bad enough to sink your teeth into any more. John Wetton and Steve Howe added excitement to contexts as pretentious as King Crimson and Yes, but this is just pompous--schlock in the grand manner, with synthesizers John Williams would love. And after listening to two lyrics about why they like their girlfriends, three about ""surviving,"" and four about why they don't like their girlfriends, I'm ready for brain salad surgery. Inspirational Verse: ""So many lines/You've heard them all/A lie is every one/From men who never understand your personality.""

When I ask myself which of the many horrible things about this adoringly promoted ""political"" record is the very worst, I'm tempted to go for broke and say the arrangements. For in truth, it is difficult to imagine circumstances under which the pop paragon's latest instrumental divertissements would signify. Chris Botti provides a few high points on trumpet--that's right, Chris Botti, high points, canceled out and then some by the anonymous saxophone soloist, who sounds to my unschooled ears like a moonlighting Kenny G. Then there are the weak yet obtrusive beats hired out to such humanitarians as Kon Artis and Dr. Dre. Rufus Wainwright doesn't really believe ""Love's the answer like I said before/It's the one thing needed maybe now even more,"" Elvis Costello maintains a suspicious distance from ""Who Are These People?"" before belting it with equally suspicious enthusiasm, and both outsing--by a lot--John Pagano (?), Josie James (?), and Donna Taylor (?), who in turn outsing--by a whole lot--chief vocalist Bacharach. Who are these people?

These three Christian sisters from Illinois specialize in arena-emo love songs to that perfect Guy, who unlike so many guys forgives them when they fail Him. One exception, if I'm not mistaken--and I may be, Christian code is a motherfucker--is ""5 Minutes of Fame,"" apparently a message song for the ""secondary virginity"" movement. Not that they're in need of the secondary kind themselves--they're lucky if ""maybe I gave in more than I should"" (for ""popularity"") recalls anything heavier than a copped feel.

This is a little better than the LPs the Gibb brothers came up with during their separation--Cucumber Castle, which at least sold some, and the solo flop Robin's Reign. It does include a bizarre juxtaposition of Jerry Reed imitation and singing strings. But ""Lonely Days"" sounded more distinctive on the radio than it does among its epigones here--the collective vibrato is turning into a grating affectation. Presumably they broke up because they sensed that the formula was getting stale. To try to re-create it yet again is to guarantee the transformation from good commercial group to bad one.

FALSE,C-,The London Chuck Berry Sessions,Chuck Berry,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6391,"
Though his backup for this promotion was less than stellar, Chuck Berry finally has an LP on the charts, which is certainly overdue recognition for the number one genius in rock and roll history. Only trouble is, the record is lousy. The live side is Chuck at his hoarsest, and ""My Ding-a-Ling"" isn't even funny the first time. The studio side is pure filler. Buy Chuck Berry's Golden Decade, More Chuck Berry, Chuck Berry's on Top, St. Louis to Liverpool, even Back Home. This doesn't do him justice.

And despite the saucy bits in ""C'est La Vie"" (first a ""You show me yours,"" then an ""I'll blow you [away]""!), this bid to whiten the Spice Girls is so clean you'll be hard-pressed to remember it's there--unless, like me, you get sick to your stomach at Uilleann hooks, mid-Atlantic brogues, and Enya lite. The obligatory rhythmic recitation, yclept ""Freak Out"" and declared ""too hot for hip hop,"" has less bottom than Audrey Hepburn and is over in two minutes.

As an increasingly regretful spearhead of the great Grand Funk switch, in which critics redefined GFR as a 1971 good old-fashioned rock and roll band even though I've never met a critic (myself included) who actually played the records, I feel entitled to put this in its place. Grand Funk is like an American white blues band of three years ago--dull. Black Sabbath is English--dull and decadent. I don't care how many rebels and incipient groovies are buying. I don't even care if the band members believe in their own Christian/satanist/liberal murk. This is a dim-witted, amoral exploitation.

But it's only part of the reason he gets me so excited I feel like I'm about to throw up. The whole band commits ""Symphony for the Devil,"" a pretty good rock and roll song revealed as a pseudohistorical middlebrow muddle when suite-ened.

John Popper's interest in fun is strictly rhetorical, and his rhetoric is so prolix I bet they only play three-hour sets so he can get all the words in. I also bet that as a Jack Bruce fan he thinks it's groovy when his rhythm section hustles out more notes than a good groove needs.

Where that one was suffused in preemptive nostalgia, this one is soggy with denial. It's full of better ways and flights into the sun, fresh starts on the south side and lives changed by the magic of Memphis (Egypt). Mortality casts its shadow--the April death of bassist Paul Atkinson is all over their longing for renewal. But the dull language deflects death's sting, and the music is craven crap that would have appalled them at 14 or 24--schlock orchestrations, socko choruses, showtime overstatements bound for the casino circuit. It's fine, maybe even essential, to assert your vitality as an old man. But imitating the old men you remember from boyhood is an ass-backwards way of doing it.

I'd never call this process deplorable per se--like pols' kids Vietnamizing their dads in the '60s, somebody has to punk up the biz's sires, and tandem tyro Paul Wexler did Tin Huey a solid that way. In this particular case, however, the outcome isn't even cute or catchy enough to dismiss as skinny-tie music--although the drummer does wear one, just in case.

Since the three women who comprise this group are avowed feminists in a time of blatant reaction, I found it hard to admit to myself how much I hated them at first. I hate them.

In early 1977, after Elektra/Asylum made music history by raising the list price of the new Queen LP 14 percent, E/A prexy Steve Wax defended the move in terms of development capital--the profits from Queen were needed to support the label's uncommercial artists.

Not that Idol would think of offending this new generation he's read about. So ""Adam in Chains,"" which after a long spoken intro devolves into what a vulgarian might take for his latest love-gone-bad rant, is in fact ""a prayer for the tomorrow people and powerjunkies.""

Hoping to prepare for future outbreaks of rhythm pap by discovering what put these London clotheshorses over, I found but two clues: acid jazz and Heatwave. Both of these apply only in Britannia. How the band secured its Grammy I defy Fredric Dannen to determine.

FALSE,C-,Freedom at Point Zero,Jefferson Starship,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7115,"
Hawkwind-goes-commercial leads off one side, Foreigner-hurries-home the other; both cuts are catchy, both sexist tripe. The rest of the album is a familiar muddle of fixations: space travel, good-time, the deluge, the possession of pretty girls. Personal to Mickey Thomas: ain't nobody gonna boogie to the moons of Saturn.

Ian Anderson is the type of guy who'll tell you on one album that a whole side is one theme and then tell you on the next that the whole album is one song. The usual shit--rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice), words.

FALSE,C-,Pieces of You,Jewel,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6229,"
Worth ignoring while she was merely precious, she demands our brief attention now that she's becoming overvalued as well. With the possible exception of Saint Joan, who at least had some stature, this is the bad folkie joke to end all bad folkie jokes. With her self-righteousness, her self-dramatization, her abiding love for her own voice, her breathy little-girl innocence and breathless baby-doll sexuality, her useless ideas about prejudice and injustice and let us not forget abuse, she may well prove as insufferable as any hollow-bodied guitarist ever to get away with craving the world's adoration. End of story--I hope.

""The cynical few,"" by which Howard appears to mean people who can think, will detect in the very title of this revolving self-help manual a hint of what the German cynic Nietzsche called ressentiment. No special interests here, folks, because all of us--male and female, rich and poor, white and other, top of the pops and glued to the telly--are in the same human boat. You think you have problems, even enemies? Think again: ""And if they were not meant to be/Well don't you think they wouldn't be""? Howard's music, up-to-date synthpopbeat featuring a human voice that may well belong to Howard himself, reflects his acceptance of the known world by adding not a thing to it. Here's hoping he changes his head sometime soon--he sure could use a new one.

When last seen they were onstage at Carnegie Hall, reading that stanza about writers and critics from ""The Times They Are A-Changin',"" and despite the title this is obviously their stab at artistic respectability, less The Knack's Second Album than Commander Chapman's Nasty Mouths Club Band. Or maybe they understand what critics don't: that little girls think it's cute and sexy to write songs about Mexican guys pimping their wives to Jewish guys. What critics understand and they don't--or maybe they're just so close to satori that they accept their limitations--is that whatever the subject, little girls prefer catchy, punchy second-hand songs to varied, indecisive thirdhand ones. In fact, so do critics.

FALSE,C-,Miss Gladys Knight,Gladys Knight,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7227,"
The most inconsistent of Gladys's albums with the Pips offered frequent glimmers of the soul in the middle of the road, but this solo shot is dreary. Not only is it markedly duller than The One and Only . . . , supposedly her farewell to the Pips, but it's also less interesting than Callin', the second album by the Pips along together. I assume producer Gary Klein arranged the switch from New York soul session guys, who have their moments, to El Lay schlock-pop session guys, who don't. So he and second-stringer Tony Macaulay (why he have three songs on this album? why he produce them?) will do as scapegoats. But is it their fault she says ""little one"" instead of ""little wog"" on a version of ""Sail Away"" in which the slave trader's gently humorous persona recalls the narrator of ""Try to Remember""? And was it they who saddled her with the Jim Gilstrap Singers, soon to change their name to the Paps? Even her summer TV show was more fun than this.

FALSE,C-,Celebrate,Kool and the Gang,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5159,"
It says something for these funk pioneers that unlike James Brown, George Clinton, and the Ohio Players they've adapted painlessly, nay profitably, to disco: a number-one single leads their Deodato-produced album into the top ten. What it says is that their funk was as bland as you suspected. Even the number-one single is disco as transformed not by funksters (cf. ""(not just) Knee Deep"" or even ""The Original Disco Man"") but by bizzers (cf. ""Fame"" or even ""Guilty"")--disco without a cult, which means without a loyal audience either.

If in 1973 I'd been told that thirteen years hence Casey Kasem would name a then ghettoized funk group as the top singles act of the '80s, my heart would have swelled until my head interjected that the top singles act of the '70s was the Osmond family. In this I would have been wise, and if I'd then been told that the secret of Kool's success would be a bland black singer named James Taylor, I would have observed that he couldn't possibly be worse than our white one. In this I could have been unduly optimistic.

The cover depicts a frightened little girl peering up from a swing at a hook-handed rapist whose huge shadow slants across her space; the girl's shadow seems to hang from the gallows-shaped K of the band logo. They love this image, exploit it in every trade ad as Sony flogs their death-industrial into its second year. They sing about child abuse, too--guess what, they're agin it.

Hans Fenger was a gifted teacher on a mission. Cutting keepsake vinyl for his kiddie choir was a great way for him to reward past involvement while inspiring more. Irwin Chusid is a tedious ideologue with a hustle. Turning that vinyl into a collectible CD is the latest way for him to remind the converted that artistic intention is reserved for the beholder in these postmodern times--especially if the beholder has a hustle. A few of these songs were great, a few of them sucked, and every one was more innocent and/or desperate in its original version except Barry Manilow's (but not the Bay City Rollers'). A special annoyance is the reportedly tear-jerking ""Desperado"" by a 10-year-old who doesn't seem to have any idea what the song means, which is to her credit as a human being but not as a singer. The sole revelation is Brian Wilson, whose six songs still sound like themselves.

I've liked this woman on record with Neil Young and on stage with Commander Cody, but her solo debut is the worst kind of backup-chick garbage, pure El Lay from its folk-pop production to its Sam Cooke desecration and J.D.

Drolly self-deprecating anti-folkie covers iconic anarcho-punk Purists for ultraleft analysis in musical form--that's just what this reeling world could use, you'd think. And indeed, it's not altogether stupid. But it's also hate-filled and hateful--not just the Crass, but second-generation beatnik Lewis, who like most hereditary bohemians was brought up to think he's better than normal people. However well he understands capitalist exploitation, his emotional response is stunted: ""I hate the living dead and their work in factories/They go like sheep to their production lines."" (""Like sheep""--what a cool image!) Historically, people in this economy have taken what they can get and had some fun in their spare time. They like Sarah Palin because they know she's as smart as Jeffrey Lewis and suspect they're not all that far behind themselves.

Exemplifying the pitfalls of the mixtape hustle is this item, which I bought blind from Amazon earlier in the year; it has now disappeared there, while mixtape king and sometime Weezy packager DJ Khaled's different CD of the same name remains on sale. Biggest problem with this one is, it isn't a Lil Wayne record. With four features and some cameos, he clocks fewer minutes on these 25 tracks than not just New Orleans rap daddy Birdman but Atlanta's carrot-nosed Young Jeezy and two of the dullest thugs in the lying business: college-educated Miami brutalist Rick Ross and elephant in the Bronx Fat Joe. Were Wayne to toss off ""I am a professional/I will cut your testicles,"" he'd sound wicked sharp; when Fat Joe recites the line, of which he's plainly very proud, even the opera sample can't dispel the impression that he's hoping to find employment as a veterinarian's assistant. While everybody else's criminal boasts are delivered in bench-press mode, Wayne can't stop dancing. Sure he'll entertain at ""The Crack House,"" but: ""This is the crack house welcome to the crack house/Man I'm talking more parties than a frat house/This is the problem, this is not music/I hope you find it, 'cause he about to lose it.""

Arthur Lee has made a good career out of anticipating and capitalizing on ideas that were natural to other people. Sometimes, as on his best Jagger imitations and most of the Forever Changes studio effects, he has seemed an almost transcendantly pop figure, and he has always written interesting songs.

Fearing serial tsunamis of subcosmic truism and womanist gush, I'd always kept away from the edge of this Canadian, such as it was. But between her Lilith Fair counterpalooza and ""Building a Mystery"" bonanza, I had to dive in, and got less than I'd bargained for. McLachlan isn't a mystic, a sister, even a NewAger--merely a singer-songwriter of monumental banality. Now ensconced in the mature satisfactions that come eventually to many unhappy young women, most of whom don't possess a clear multioctave voice or modest tune sense, she's proud to encase her homilies of succor and self-acceptance in settings that don't call undue attention to her compositional ambitions. Renormalized pop at its most unnecessary.

The title cut is the great novelty song that may be about the death of rock and roll or may be about its refusal to die. The other material here indicates that McLean himself believes the former, but since it also indicates that he couldn't have composed ""American Pie""--he just took dictation from the shade of Buddy Holly, who must be taking some pretty strong drugs up there to make such a mistake--you might as well judge for yourself. And do so like a real novelty-lover, by buying the single--unless you're in the market for a song about how nobody understood Van Gogh.

Here's where the pimple comes to a head--if this isn't adolescent angst in its death throes, then Buddy Holly lived his sweet, unselfconscious life in vain. The lyrics offer wit amid heat and power (will ""lyric-sheet verse"" soon turn into the macho converse of ""greeting-card verse""?) and the music pulls out the stops quite knowingly (will Phil Spector soon be remembered as the Rachmaninoff of rock and roll?). Occasionally it seems that horrified, contemptuous laughter is exactly the reaction this production team intends, and it's even possible that two percent of the audience will get the joke. But the basic effect is grotesquely grandiose. Bruce Springsteen, beware--this is what you've wrought, and it could happen to you.

I can't deny it because I catch myself grinning--distanced by the years, and with the campy kicks magnified by a heightened awareness of Freddie Mercury's sexuality, the music of Queen has accrued the high gloss of committed kitsch, where that of Journey, say, has assumed the dull shapelessness of utter crap. Although I don't enjoy all of Classic Queen or Queen's Greatest Hits--the material's not quite that deep--they're often funny and they're also pop, oddly reminiscent of top-grade Cheap Trick. So lest anyone suspect me of sentimentalizing the dead, let me isolate this resurrected cult item, proof that you don't have to be homophobic to hate opera fantasies. Mercury's voice, unnecessarily strong and pure by rock standards, sounds like a ragged old thing up against that of a true diva well past her prime, while the diva trips over the elementary rhythmic demands of the Brian May-less material, which imparts new meaning to the concept of not quite that deep.

Poor guy, is he that hard up? Or is it just that like all comedians he longs to prove that he's not as nasty as we know him to be in his finest moments? Well, women aren't gonna take him on down because he sings like this--his voice is so thin that in the end Rick James (""Comedians get all the pussy. You crack a joke, women fall into bed with you"") wastes his best track in years on it. And though Stevie Wonder donates two songs, Murphy doesn't bring out his Stevie impression except on his own ""I, Me, Us, We,"" which as a result is the strongest piece of music here. It also typifies the one-worlder cheerleading of a lyricist who can't be as bright as we'd hoped him to be in his finest moments--he's got politics like Jerry Lewis, only with less soul.

If anyone can write a rock ballad to a deposed Russian princess made famous by Ingrid Bergman it's Murphy--the image sums up the F. Scott Fitzgerald/Rhett Butler (and Eva Braun?) side of a boy-man who's also heir to the traditional reverence for Jimi Hendrix and James Dean. Instead, the song is the embarrassing epitome of a record on which Murphy sounds spoiled instead of sensitive, presumptuous instead of ambitious, and about as comfortable with rock and roll as Roderick Falconer.

The ""Schm"" is for schmaltz, to which this is a tribute--the selections, none of which were written after 1958, include ""For Me and My Gal"" and ""I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now."" Theoretically, this is a charming idea--who among us is better equipped to bring such music back to life? Actually, it's soporific--devoid of humor or irony but without any rediscovery of the whole-hearted emotion on which the old songs are predicated. Nilsson doesn't sing with much power and Gordon Jenkins's charts don't even qualify as period pieces. I know, I'm just a dumb rock and roll fan, so go waste your money. I wouldn't give my extra copy to my mother.

With Cincinnati a hotbed of racial mishegas from Uncle Tom's Cabin and Stephen Foster to Marge Schott and the Afghan Whigs, why shouldn't these four white boys be the younger generation's answer to Boyz II Men? They're certainly realer than the Backstreet Boys. But no way does that guarantee they're as good. Their mild singing is soulful only because there's no competent pop that isn't anymore. Their goopy hit ballad has nothing on a little something called ""Heaven's Missing an Angel."" And next time--they promise, assuming like so many young fools before them that there'll be one--they're going to write the material themselves.

Too used and abused to pursue their business interests, the self-appointed ""real niggaz"" watched other fake gangstas climb the charts till they could bear it no more. So they threw together this $6.98-list shortie and hoped Amerikkka would want it. Their best riff of 1988 is their best riff of 1990, attached to a blaxploitation docudrama pitting fake gangstas against fake cops (probably played by members of their management team). And for that 2 Live touch they hire a woman (as we'll call her) to mouth their instructions on cocksucking technique, one of many things they don't know dick about. To wit: first ""grab"" (ouch); then ""lick"" (just twice, before you get down to bidness); then ""insert"" (now ""take it slow""); and ""before you know it"" (damn soon), ""splash."" When she swallows, she inspires such a conflation of awe and disgust she's forced to service the rest of the crew forthwith.

This is supposed to be where they finally slam nonstop. In fact, however, the music's just like the lyrics--market-ready. Catchy, yes, and funky in its laid-back electro way, but never hard enough to scare off the novelty audience. Which might be fun if they didn't outpig the LAPD in the bargain. Can Chuck D really believe they mean what they say? Sure they really hate women, and anybody else who looks at them funny. But unless they're even sicker than they seem, they're too greedy to murder anybody as long as they can make so much money fronting about it. And so they've calculated every rhyme to push somebody's button--to serve up the thrill of transgression to ghettobound and merely ghettocentric young-black-males, and also to the big score, culturally deprived white boys seeking exotic role models. That kids will take them at their word obviously doesn't concern niggaz who'll be hard-pressed to contain their pent-up hostility after the bubble bursts. It'd be nice to think they'll off each other when that great day comes, but I doubt they have the balls. So in the interests of public safety, pray they don't get taken by their investment advisors.

The three best-selling record albums of all time are Tapestry, Bridge Over Troubled Water, and The Sound of Music. One way of explaining how unmonolithic ""mass"" culture really is is to point out how few consumers are likely to own all three. And a way of explaining how stupefying Jane Olivor is is to guess that she not only owns all three, but would put them in her all-time top 10. Live, she enunciates Neil Diamond and John Denver lyrics with the intense credulity of someone who thinks poetry is anything that rhymes; her LP is marginally adventurous, but if she becomes a star it will be by embodying the half of Barbra Streisand that Bette Midler put in the garbage. Recycling should never go this far.

Since I got big yucks out of 1992's spoken-word twofer The Boxed Life, which recalled a lab-assistant job and other homely pursuits, I am entitled to grouse about the grim star diary that is 1997's spoken-word twofer Black Coffee Blues. And while it's no surprise that this thrash-and-churn is his metalest metal ever, it's amazing that Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen made Rollins their flagship rocker--for all his corp clout and cult cred, he was off the charts a month after he muscled on. As pathetic as it is for aging Spinal Taps to fabricate melodrama out of an adolescent despair they remember via groupies and fan mail, it's even more pathetic never to feel anything else.

But when it scored in my own critics' poll I could remain silent no longer. Forget phrasing, interpretation, or--God knows from someone who had trouble rocking ""Heat Wave""--swing. All Ronstadt does with these fine-to-middling pop standards is stifle them beneath her moderately gorgeous voice. Her triumph is conceptual--genteel neoconservatives, kneejerk pluralists, one-upping convolutionists, and out-and-out ignoramuses all get off on the idea of a ""rock"" performer validating the prerock values such songs signal.

FALSE,C-,Torture Tactics,Vio-lence,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5868,"
Corporate-censored off the Atlantic-backed Oppressing the Masses, the title track reflects thrash-metal's chronic confusion between politics and horror comics. ""Gutterslut"" (""Gonna make this bitch bleed"") and ""Dicks of Death"" (""Suck it, whore"") reveal the lighter side of earnest nihilists who have hormones after all. Plus a live remake equals an EP. I prefer the major-label version.

FALSE,C-,It's Raining Today: The Scott Walker Story (1967-1970),Scott Walker,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5941,"
Nothing I'd read about this L.A. wannabe turned moody Brit teenthrob--going back to Nik Cohn's Rock From the Beginning, which pegged him as ""top-heavy and maudlin"" in 1968--prepared me for how purely godawful he'd be. We're talking Anthony Newley without the voice muscles, ""MacArthur Park"" as light-programme boilerplate, a male Vera Lynn for late bloomers who found Paul McCartney too r&amp;b. Go ahead, believe Nick Cave, Oasis, Foetus, and, I cannot tell a lie, compiler Marshall Crenshaw. But I'm warning you--when I gave him the benefit of the doubt, all I got was this lousy review.

FALSE,C-,Stone Gon',Barry White,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15193,"
White's hustle is to unite Isaac Hayes's power with Al Green's niceness, and in his way, he does. He is as humorless as Hayes, but with none of Hayes's grandeur, which is 90 per cent phony anyway. And he is as mendacious as Green, but with none of Green's sexy charm, which at least keeps its promise for a night or two. It so happens that I love the single--the man puts down powerful tracks--but the single isn't eight minutes long.

Whitlock's mindless, indefatigable soul-straining was essential to Derek and the Dominoes, yet even though the usual pack of musical demigods accompanies him here, all that comes through is the strain. Proving that even in rock and roll unmitigated mindlessness is never really indefatigable.

Even known assholes don't come up with concept albums slavering to send our ""top guns"" after Saddam (sounds like ""Satan""), complaining to Lincoln about ""nuisance suits,"" and advocating the freelance murder of miscreants who beat the rap (he claims).

FALSE,C-,A Touch on the Rainy Side,Jesse Winchester,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8134,"
Winchester has made a couple of pretty good albums (the first and the fifth), three uneven ones (two, three, and four) and a real stinkeroo (say hello to number six). The only thing that might make the lyrics more annoying would be for the music to induce you to notice them, and the best song on the record was done a lot better eight years ago by Tony Orlando.

FALSE,C-,In the Heart of the Young,Winger,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5852,"
The pall pop metal casts upon 1990's horrendous Hot 100 is a triumph of mass narrowcasting. By downplaying anything blatant in the music, marketers minimize tuneouts based on accidents of gender or subgeneration--potentially, any passive Caucasian under age 25 should be willing to consume (in descending order of marginal differentiation) Poison or Warrant or Jon Bon or Heart or Cheap Trick or David Goddamn Cassidy. So let the nadir stand in for all of them. Swallowing hooks from blooze to prog, masking their will to power in fake vulnerability and youthcult rote, Winger is Whitesnake with the sexism muted and the facelifts down the road. They may last a while, they may not. They're so bad that they're not even completely terrible.

McCartney is coming to terms with his own fluff--the overproduction sounds less cluttered this time--but it's still fluff, and not even goosedown. Maybe the thrill of leading his very own band has him distracted. (Yes, Linda is in it--that's the good part.)

FALSE,C-,Have You Forgotten?,Daryl Worley,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12209,"
So united are we that few Voice readers are even aware of the title song, which spent seven weeks atop the country chart hawking the Iraq war with the doubly misleading refrain, ""And you say you shouldn't worry about bin Laden/Have you forgotten?"" (To be perfectly clear, no sane American says don't worry about bin Laden, and no honest one claims he had anything to do with Iraq before we devastated it.) Also included are permission to a P.O.W. to cut Darryl off on the interstate, a white-collar grunt screwing a Mexican hooker, a blue-collar grunt running away with his cashier girlfriend, a lament that the Civil War was ever fought, and ""Those Less Fortunate Than I,"" a rare and convincing argument that he and his listeners bear some responsibility for the inner city. Nor does this last seem a p.c. smokescreen. More likely Worley's just a thoughtful guy who watches too much Fox News. Which doesn't make his smash an iota less evil.

If the title tune seems familiar it's because you tuned it out along with ""Kiss You All Over"" a few months ago. The culprits are ex-Easybeats Harry Vanda and George ""No Relation"" Young, the power-pop production heroes whose first LP with this singer actually did offer much of the bright thrust claimed for the style--not to mention the triviality that goes along with it. It didn't sell, though, and here V&amp;Y prove their depth of aesthetic principle by mellowing and syncopating their boy into MOR AOR fodder, four leisurely tunes to the side.

Since this is already the best-selling group in the universe, I finally have an answer when people ask me to name the Next Big Thing. What I wonder is how we can head them off at the airport. Plan A: Offer Bjorn and Benny the leads in Beatlemania (how could they resist the honor?) and replace them with John Phillips and Denny Doherty. Plan B: Appoint Bjorn head of the U.N. and Benny his pilot (or vice versa) and replace them with John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Plan C: Overexpose them in singing commercials.

If Debbie Gibson already has platinum imitators, there's more to the world than is dreamt of in Madonna's philosophy. This unthreateningly dusky disco-dolly-next-door plays the field romantic-metaphorwise, with a weakness for can't-help-myself. She's less imitator than imitation, short on tokens of self-creation--her only writing credit is also the only time she threatens to play around.

Brian Johnson takes over, defining an anthemic grandiosity more suitable to their precious-metal status than Bon Scott's old-fashioned raunch. Also dumber.

Adams's fourth and final 2005 CD--Cold Roses was a double, remember?--comprises nine verbose tales and laments. None are fast, six are slow, six amble past five minutes, and all seem to go on forever. Occasional rhythm tracks notwithstanding, the music is dominated by Adams's desultory guitar, please-not-more piano, and sensitive vocals. Although September's Jacksonville City Nights was the mess a lesser talent would have barfed up years ago, puffs of tune and vapor trails of feeling did waft briefly from its twangy swamp. These meanderings are the kind of indulgence that ends label deals. If I were Luke Lewis, all that would stop me would be the outpourings of personal vituperation and musical self-pity certain to ensue.

FALSE,C,Songs About Me,Trace Adkins,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12903,"
Adkins is one of these guys who spends so much time in the weight room that his arms don't hang plumb from his shoulders. In the rear view thoughtfully provided his female fans in the booklet, only his ponytail and his cowboy hat distinguish him from the Incredible Hulk. You'd never confuse him with the similarly named Clay Aiken, a much wimpier guy, and not just in the delts--Adkins's baritone sounds like it emanates from the Mammoth Cave. But in the most essential matter you'd be dead wrong. Track record notwithstanding, the ex-gospel singer is every bit as much a calculated corporate creation as the duly elected idol. The 11 songs on this No. 1 country, No. 11 pop album were written by 23 songwriters, only one of whom has his name on even two. The most far-fetched is ""Arlington,"" in which Dave Turnbull vouchsafes the patriotic thoughts of a dead soldier--to be specific, the first Tennesseean to die in our current Iraq war--to former DUI Adkins. Needless to say, the artist suffers no anxieties over exactly why any of these songs he didn't write is ""about me."" These are ""songs I've been waiting to record for my entire career."" Especially ""Honky Tonk Badonkadonk.""

I was ready to discard this but because it was so pretty I suffered second thoughts, which is too bad for both of us. In 1967, Andersen sounded like early electric Dylan, so now he sounds like . . .

Let the record show that they loved the people so much that with all deliberate greed they ""rearranged"" half of their biggest and only album for quick resale. Let the record show that to stretch the material to full-price length they basted on a fashion sermon and seven as-I-would-say ""versions."" And let the record show that the people understood their spiritual needs so poorly that the resulting live and MTV-approved product lingered a mere 12 weeks on the charts, never rising above 60.

Can this marriage be saved?

The doctor replies: if they develop the intestinal fortitude to go along with their own vocal limitations, they may not end up the Peaches &amp; Herb of middle-class soul. What did they say?

You remember how in the old days when they wanted to convey how really far out ""rock"" was getting they'd say that a musician had ""studied at Juilliard""?

The renown of this sorry punk-funk gone pop-jazz is as depressing as anything in the annals of Anglophilia. Lesley Woods's line on free love is as priggish as the rest of her leftism and her separate-but-equal rhythm section couldn't make the earth move if one of them played tractor. Don't blame me for the metaphor, either--it's Lesley's, by way of famed protofeminist E. Hemingway, which proves that she's either open-minded or just plain dumb. Not since the Stranglers has a Brit group sexed it up so unconvincingly.

Once their name was a candid joke about their limits, their values, and their aspirations. Now it's a flat statement of fact.

Lest you doubted it, this is grotesque, and not just because stardom ruined Nick Carter like so many young people before him. It's more that nobody loves a man group. Blue-balled yearning becomes AJ-said-you-swallowed whining, which wasn't the formal challenge their Swedish Svengalis signed on for. Maybe they could learn their instruments and call themselves a man band, which rhymes. An album of Four Lads covers is also a thought.

The opening ""Glass"" does indeed deploy what a Pitchfork raver designates a ""strange mix of elements (chamber pop, prog metal, new age--what?) magically coalesced into some entirely new genre that I wish existed and yet still can't quite wrap my brain around."" If you suspect, correctly, that this so-called genre is unworthy of your brainlength, Natasha Khan will make you cringe. Compared to Kate Bush, Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rk, even Joanna Newsom, she's an etherhead, as ill-informed about astronomy as she is about love. That said, the beauteous Eurasian hippie does get a little grounded when she dons a blonde wig and""evil, evil,"" though to me she just seems confused. Grounded or ethereal, Khan has the kind of pretty, proper British accent that young men find fetching when linked to ill-informed mentions of goodbye beds and licking her clean. She has hitched her modest talent to an art-rock wagon she won't outpace anytime soon.

Eternally faithful to early Dan, I hoped to descry the lineaments of unspoiled genius in these 1968-1971 demos, but all I got was demos. Between Fagen's scratch vocals and three grooveless drummers who sound relieved to remember their parts, these are songs casting about for a form--that is, for Gary Katz, whose smooth swing suited them far better than the bare bones Kenny Vance resorts to.

Country music is for those old or repressed enough to care deeply about monogamy--one-on-one love in all its passion, comfort, consternation, impossibility, and routine. That's why I doubt the Nashville hunks have siphoned much support from Nirvana, Madonna, or Public Enemy--their targets are Richard Marx and Bryan Adams. Still, this is a sad one. Spoiled by fame or his own manly profile--he looks so craggy up against his Knots Landing wifey on the cover of People--a guy who got Nashville to notice him with terse neoclassicist regrets gets Hollywood to bank him with soggy pseudoromantic homilies. Imagine how tritely condescending ""A Woman Has Her Way"" could be and you'll know what sentiments Clint considers suitable to a matinee idol.

I've feuded for years with moralists who accused the band of abandoning a lowbrow purity they never claimed in the first place, but this is a lousy record by any standard--the pop, the eclectic, even the arty. That Debbie is writing all the lyrics is only symptomatic--the tragedy is that of an absorptive, synthetic talent trying to find its essence, a doomed project that's doubly disorienting because she's canny enough not to believe in ""self-expression"" per se.

Never again can us wiseasses call it corporate rock without thinking twice. Whatever possessed Tom Scholz to spend seven years perfecting this apparently unoccupied articulation of an art-metal thought extinct years ago, it wasn't megaplatinum ambition. He's more like the Archbishop of Latter-Day Arena Rock, perfecting majestic guitar sounds and angelic vocals for hockey-rink cathedrals the world over--and also, since he's patently reluctant to venture from his studio retreat, elegiac melodies suitable to a radio ministry.

What makes Bowie a worthy entertainer is his pretensions, his masks, the way he simulates meaning. He has no special gift for convincing emotions or good tunes--when he works at being ""merely"" functional he's merely dull, or worse. With Nile Rodgers gone, the dance potential of the second album of his professional phase is negligible, and he's favoring the tired usages that have been the downfall of an entire generation of English twits. In this setting, not even Leiber-Stoller's long-neglected ""I Keep Forgetting"" makes much of an impression.

FALSE,C,The Spirit Room,Michelle Branch,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10319,"
Only in a biz discombobulated by teenpop could an 18-year-old with an acoustic guitar be plausibly promoted as ""the anti-Britney."" Don't you remember? Writing Your Own Songs means zip, zilch, nada. By now, literally millions of human beings WTOS, and while Branch may be among the top 5000 (and may not), note that her hit, like most of the front-loaded material, was co-composed by her producer. In this she precisely resembles arrant bimbo Willa Ford, who made her mark batting her plump lips at Nick Carter and Carson Daly and may yet prove the more interesting artist. Britney sure is.

FALSE,C,Dance! . . . Ya Know It!,Bobby Brown,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=365,"
Disco postmodernists say there's no such thing as a song any more--only versions. Talk about the triumph of theory. Proof that they're full of it can be found on Brown's Don't Be Cruel, where the song versions of five of these nine dance-remixes-cum-consumer-frauds can be found.

FALSE,C,Slaughter's Big Rip-Off,James Brown,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6470,"
As movie scores go, this ripoff is only medium-sized. At least it apes Oliver Nelson rather than Henry Mancini, and sometimes it even breaks away from the atmosphere into something earthier. Worth hearing: ""Sexy, Sexy, Sexy.""

FALSE,C,Bodyheat,James Brown,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6479,"
Two or three functional dance tracks, and Brown's will always be tougher than MFSB's. But not than Brown's. ""Woman"" is unlistenably sanctimonious, ""What the World Needs Now Is Love"" is the raggedest singing I've ever heard from him, and ""Kiss in 77"" is ""head to head and toe to toe""--in other words as ""brand new"" as the ""New Sound!"" he promises.

FALSE,C,Mutha's Nature,James Brown,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6480,"

FALSE,C,Soul Session Live,James Brown and Friends,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4468,"
Beyond Aretha, forget the cameo attractions--Billy Vera (wan), Joe Cocker (rough), and Robert Palmer (compared by JB to Elvis, Otis, and Jackie, and don't you sometimes wish he was just as far out of the way?). Also, the band's not improving, and even at that it's sharper than his voice, which you probably figured and which sinks his umpteenth de facto best-of once and for all. Is this what he's showing his parole officer? Poor guy.

FALSE,C,Grace,Jeff Buckley,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5898,"
Although Tim's vocal traces are in his genes as surely as John's are in Julian's, it's wrong to peg him as the unwelcome ghost of his overwrought dad. Young Jeff is a syncretic asshole, beholden to Zeppelin and Nina Simone and Chris Whitley and the Cocteau Twins and his mama--your mama too if you don't watch out. ""Sensitivity isn't being wimpy,"" he avers. ""It's about being so painfully aware that a flea landing on a dog is like a sonic boom."" So let us pray the force of hype blows him all the way to Uranus.

FALSE,C,Big Red Letter Day,Buffalo Tom,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5885,"
In which the purely horrendous Dinosaur Jr. clones of Birdbrain enlist the aid of reputed pop producers to reconfigure themselves as virtually mediocre Soul Asylum drones. Don't despair, children, the attempted J Mascis roar is still with us--augmented, as they say, by jangle, harmony, and the occasional tunelessly rendered tune. Does college radio really believe this is art and Janet Jackson isn't?
"
FALSE,C,Sun Secrets,Eric Burdon Band,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6511,"
In this age of fiberglass, Burdon's stage show appears genuinely demented--his guitar players look like head-comix versions of Chuck Berry and Panama Red, and on his second encore he holds the entire mikestand in his teeth, like a dirk. But when poor Eric was on the radio in Boston not long ago, more than one kid called in to ask how he did the guitar parts on ""Layla.""

FALSE,C,Church of Anthrax,John Cale and Terry Riley,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1757,"
I was impressed to come upon this collaboration between Riley, whose pop avant-garde meditation, A Rainbow in Curved Air, inspired me to concoct the term ""semipopular music,"" and Cale, whose pop avant-garde rock group, the Velvet Underground, should have done the same. Bet the people at CBS were impressed, too. So impressed they put out an album of keyboard doodles posing as improvisations.

FALSE,C,Cameosis,Cameo,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4495,"
""Shake your pants, I like the way they dance/Shake your pants for action and romance,"" goes the biggest hit on their biggest album, which gets these disco-funk careerists' thematic daring just right. I'm waiting for the follow-up: ""Shake your ass, I like its heft and mass/Shake your ass, oh no, that sounds too crass.""
"
FALSE,C,Howlin Mercy,John Campbell,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5886,"
This white bluesman paid his dues on the Gulf Coast circuit, then moved to New York and went electric. Shortly after he released his second album, his fatal heart attack attracted as much attention as his music ever had. Given his loose talk of teaching hellhounds to sit and keeping the devil in his hole, some wondered piously whether he'd made a pact with the unnamable. More likely he just drank too much.
"
FALSE,C,Candlebox,Candlebox,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5899,"
These postgrunge scenesuckers aren't total pop-metal conformists--they're a tad more intense, with sharper drumming. Their chief distinction is that at 2.5 mill they'll probably outsell the artist-cum-label-owner who set siege to Seattle to sign them--the one we hoped would next re-create herself as a visionary entrepreneur.

FALSE,C,Mariah Carey,Mariah Carey,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5840,"
I swear I didn't know her mama was an opera singer, but I'm embarrassed that I didn't guess. She gets too political in her brave, young, idealistic attack on ""war, destitution and sorrow"": ""Couldn't we accept each other/Can't we make ourselves aware."" Elsewhere she sticks to what she doesn't know--love. Debbie Gibson, all is forgiven.
"
FALSE,C,Belinda,Belinda Carlisle,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8218,"
At least Jane Wiedlin's solo was a well-meaning failure. This one's pure El Lay, vacuous would-be CHR with chief songwriter Charlotte Caffey spelled by numerous ringers. The best you can say about the best of these songs--namely, ""Band of Gold""--is that you've heard it before; the best you can say about the rest is that once in a while you think you have.

FALSE,C,Carp,Carp,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6547,"
For those of you who are really into Americana, here's an album with songs about Calamity Jane, a circuit preacher named Brown, and firehouse dogs. For those of you who are really into bands that have paid their dues, this one formed at the University of Oklahoma five years ago. And you won't catch Carp imitating Jefferson Airplane or Bessie Smith either.
"
FALSE,C,Born Late,Shaun Cassidy,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6554,"
Desperate to keep up with the younger generation (i.e., their kids), a few old Beatlemaniacs are murmuring that Shaun isn't so bad--he likes the music more than David ever did, his covers show some feeling, and ""Hey Deanie"" actually rocks. All of which is true. And all of which is still pretty lame.
"
FALSE,C,Henry's Dream,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5870,"
Cave's admirers crow about his literary virtues--a rock musician who's actually published a novel! and scripted a film! about John Henry Abbott, how highbrow! Then they proffer dismal examples like ""I am the captain of my pain,"" or the bordello containing--what an eye the man has--a whalebone corset! (Whalebone is very literary--it hasn't been used in underwear since well before Nick was born.) If this is your idea of great writing, you may be ripe for his cult. Otherwise, forget it--the voice alone definitely won't do the trick.
"
FALSE,C,Some Friendly,The Charlatans U.K.,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5854,"
Historically, children, the organ has occasioned vague-outs and one-shots. Unless you count the Animals, which I don't advise, or the Zombies, where Rod Argent favored piano, the only '60s pop legends to feature one were the Small Faces, and not as a ""trademark."" When you record your ""96 Tears,"" or even your ""Itchycoo Park,"" call. ""The Only One I Know"" ain't bad and ain't it.

"
FALSE,C,Cherie,Cherie,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12675,"
The subject of a painstakingly hedged 2003 John Seabrook profile in The New Yorker, she's a teenage Whitney-Celine-Mariah wannabe who's more fun than Hilary Duff and less fun than Ashlee Simpson. Two and a half years and several million bucks in the marketing, her debut album failed to chart after its modest dance hit skyrocketed all the way to 99 on the Billboard Hot 100.  In principle, this is an ideal time for an American idol who is both French and--ooh la la--Jewish. But her flop feels like a victory nonetheless.

FALSE,C,Chicago VI,Chicago,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11492,"

I had trouble placing this coolish, soulish aural cocktail until I saw the live act, which centered (at least for me) on a supernumerary conga player with the coif, sunlamp tan and UltraBrite grin of an airline steward. Headset Muzak.
"
FALSE,C,The Whitey Album,Ciccone Youth,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4539,"
""Into the Groovey"" you should know. ""Burnin' Up"" you shouldn't, 'cause this one's ""the original demo on four-track cassette,"" and also 'cause it sucks. ""Addicted to Love"" was cut live to a canned backing track in a record-your-own-single booth and will make my top 10 if they deign to release it as a single. The rest is funny mixes, found girl talk, beats from a band not noted for same, and other remembrances of their avant-bullshit roots. Why don't they take this stuff to John Cage? I want to be sure I get course credit.
"
FALSE,C,Byrds,"Gene Clark, Chris Hillman, David Crosby, Roger McGuinn, Michael Clarke",1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6586,"
Don't believe the title, believe the artist listing. The difference is between a group, committed however fractiously to a coherent collective identity, and a bunch of stars fabricating a paper reconciliation. Maybe if Gary Usher had produced, as promised, this would be more than the country-rock supersession David Crosby has granted us--because maybe Usher would have persuaded the boys to let go of the songs they're saving for their solo albums.
"
FALSE,C,David Clayton-Thomas,David Clayton-Thomas,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6588,"
Believe it or not, intol'able David has loosened up some since his big-band days, and his material is well-selected, but he still sounds as if he takes an emetic when he needs an enema, and unlike Tom Jones, whom he might emulate by losing some weight, he always compares embarrassingly to his sources.
"
FALSE,C,Shadow Man,Johnny Clegg & Savuka,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4549,"
No matter what the British Musicians' Union says, I don't doubt that he's progressive in the ANC sense. I just wish he wasn't progressive in the Peter Gabriel sense, or at least had Gabriel's talent and taste--his keybs and drums left one innocent byhearer wondering why I was checking out the new Yes. This is the kind of college man who thinks rock is art and ""human rainbow"" and ""ache that has no name"" are turns of phrase. Even when he sticks to the facts that are all the metaphor any South African poet needs, his vocal melodrama empties the words of poignancy. Progress deserves better. So does a multiracial society.
"
FALSE,C,Music Maker,Jimmy Cliff,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6590,"
It's time we reminded ourselves that there are only four Jimmy Cliff songs on The Harder They Come. His other great ones are on Wonderful World, Beautiful People. The nearest this surprisingly ornate and dinky album comes to a good one is the indictment of Island Records' Chris Blackwell as a ""No. 1 Rip-Off Man,"" very timely given what Island has just scrounged up for its own Jimmy Cliff album, Struggling Man. But both records portend a nonstar of the future--or a false one.
"
FALSE,C,I Can Stand a Little Rain,Joe Cocker,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6598,"
If Jim Price were a producer worthy of the artist, or even of the artist's memory, he would have asked Jerry Lee Lewis to play piano instead of Nicky Hopkins. Not that Jerry Lee could replace Chris Stainton, who combined with Cocker last time to write more good hooks than all of Hollywood's finest coughed up for this make-work project.
"
FALSE,C,Jamaica Say You Will,Joe Cocker,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6599,"
Think back to how drastically Cocker's early triumph--""With a Little Help From My Friends"" or ""Just Like a Woman"" or ""Darling Be Home Soon"" or ""Bird on the Wire""--departed from the originals; he literally forced us to rehear those songs. Then compare the strongest cut here, ""Lucinda,"" with Randy Newman's prototype; arrangement and vocal approach are almost identical. That's the nut. Cocker and Leon Russell funkified pop so persuasively that they set up their own minitradition, and now Cocker can't imagine transcending it.
"
FALSE,C,No Jacket Required,Phil Collins,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4573,"
Between his self-deprecating videos and his good taste in business associates (better Philip Bailey than, say, Steve Perry), Collins isn't as hateful as an art-rock leader-by-default turned best-selling-solo-artist-in-the-world-this-month might be. In fact, he's not hateful at all. But it takes more than that to make me want to hear a stupid love song again. Never mind the absolutely unsurprising lyrics and arrangements and just tell me why this is a great mean of Britpop voices? Is it because no one ever wonders what it sounds like unfiltered?
"
FALSE,C,Fat City,Shawn Colvin,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5871,"
This ambitious sophomore wins the prize--the female postfolkie you're too bored to hate. The digitalized Suzanne Vega is wisely popwise and the bionic Joan Baez positively swangin' by comparison. Matching strong, undistinguished voice to literate, undistinguished verse, Colvin is like a young Joni Mitchell without swoops or self-invention. And lest you riposte that young Joni Mitchell beats old Joni Mitchell, Columbia doles out production chores to old Joni Mitchell's bass-playing husband, who drags the ordinary down toward an offensively well-groomed studio folk-rock that combines the smugness of '70s El Lay with the overstatement of '80s Megapop--and later for the '90s.
"
FALSE,C,Rock 'n Roll Again,Commander Cody,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6613,"
In which a mastermind whose own best songs were eccentric oldies and whose energy and charm were identical to his irresponsibility pens all the tunes for a slickly produced and woogieless boogie album. How the flaky have fallen.
"
FALSE,C,The Lady's Not for Sale,Rita Coolidge,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6621,"
Cute title, but my best information is that you're still expected to pay for this in stores. And even if you weren't it would just clutter the house--from a great female hope she's developed into someone who sings ""Fever"" with all of the heat (and none of the charm) of Keith doin ""98.6.""
"
FALSE,C,Anytime . . . Anywhere,Rita Coolidge,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6622,"
This was gonna be her annual sultry cornpone, unobjectionable except for the Neil Sedaka tune and not without its soulful moments, when A&amp;M prexy Jerry Moss told Rita how to become worthy of Kris. You'll get more sales, Jerry opined, if people Recognize Your Material. Try a Motown revival, one of Boz's lesser songs, a Bee Gees number, maybe that wonderful Sam Cooke classic the Stones did once--and who can lose with ""Higher and Higher""? It seems to have worked, too, except that those of us with fond memories can still hear the originals. Rita is now halfway to becoming Andy Williams with cleavage. It takes a very special kind of stupidity to slow ""Higher and Higher"" into a down.
"
FALSE,C,Dig?,The Coolies,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4583,"
Lame as the assembled Simon &amp; Garfunkel songs were in the original, they're lamer still in these speedy, occasionally funny-voiced takeoffs. Though the band might have gotten away with an EP featuring ""Having My Baby,"" the only satire here with any teeth and the only one that doesn't target Paul Simon, I find it bewildering that anyone can hate Graceland enough to pay them for turning their stoned fantasy into an album. A glaring example of the post-modernist dictum that art about art is boring but junk about kitsch isn't.
"
FALSE,C,Easy Action,Alice Cooper,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6623,"
Pretties for You had its pseudo-decadent and -psychedelic charms, and so does this, only not as many, which makes very few indeed--""Mr. and Misdemeanor"" (featuring Lucky Luciano and Kenny Passarelli) and a junkie shoe salesman to balance off all the tuneless singing, tuneless playing, tuneless tunes, and pseudo-musique concrete.
"
FALSE,C,Muscle of Love,Alice Cooper,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6628,"
They went out on the road long enough to pick up their share of chrome (well, this sure ain't platinum), but though it must pain them to realize it, they're not machines. Or maybe it just pains them to realize that machines break down.
"
FALSE,C,Country Joe and the Fish,Country Joe & the Fish,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10987,"
There is only one first-rate song here--""Flying High,"" the far-out tale of a lucky hitchhiker--and while it is possible to become permanently accustomed to the slow instrumentals and songpoems that are this band's psychedelic signature, their rhythms and melodies are as unfocused as a bad light show. All this is salvaged, theoretically, by the politics, but the cocky, petulant, yet strangely attractive vocals never quite succeed in making callow belligerence seem an unmitigated virtue.
"
FALSE,C,Left for Dead,Crazy Horse,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5841,"
Anyone mind-damaged by Ragged Glory should note that the essential Crazy Horse is a rhythm section, as the kind-hearted designate Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. The chief vocalist-songwriter here is a fellow named Sonny Mone, who misses 1969. ""Once there was a rose in a fisted glove,"" he pines--and also real metal, dammit, not MTV shit.
"
FALSE,C,Human Clay,Creed,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5311,"
In the year rock died again, what should come storming back but metal--d/b/a ""hard"" or ""loud"" rock and, as Syracuse demonstrated, uglier than ever. Yet these God-fearing grunge babies sound falser than rape-inciting Limp Bizkit, abuse-tripping Static-X, party animals Buckcherry, or even world-dance Days of the New. Because their songs address universals, they don't debase women, a plus. But their spirituality is as sodden as their sonics. I mean, it's not as if familial oppression isn't real. It's the main thing that turns the hard and loud into truth-seekers and revenge-seekers both. So after years of Marilyn Manson lies, young bands seem to have found a psychic space where such themes open up the musical imagination. By contrast, these guys are still in denial, bellowing regressive circumlocutions to drown out the truth inside. Which is what? Maybe lust.

(Seven songs plus one piano concerto divided by 5cc.) plus (one paltry eccentric musician-battling-ecodisaster plot multiplied by Peter Cook) equals (three good-humored, inconsequential twelve-inch discs plus one twelve-inch booklet plus one gift box). Unfortunately, it also equals something else, sure as the world ends: a list price of $20.98. For which it is docked a notch.

FALSE,C,Looking Forward,"Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young",1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8692,"
Right, you knew already. But though I pray I hear solo Y render the title song hopeful instead of smug, I know that in my head I'll still hear N harmonizing insipidly behind. And when S explains how when he was young old people were wrong and now that he's old young people are wrong and then disses ""overfed talking heads"" without ever once acknowledging overfed singing exhead C to his immediate left, I imagine some computer nerd with more brains than sense joining the arms race just to get even. Still a menace--and still conceited about it.
"
FALSE,C,Temple of Low Men,Crowded House,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4605,"
Problem's not that philistine tastemakers are quashing Neil Finn's hit-debut blues, but that Finn has neglected the only thing he has to offer the world: perky hooks. Programmers don't care what he's brooding about because nobody else does. Plenty of popsters have managed to stir up interest in their petty anxieties. Be thankful there isn't one more.
"
FALSE,C,From Luxury to Heartache,Culture Club,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4615,"
For once the title trip sounds like tragedy rather than just desserts. Not a musical tragedy, though suddenly the music bores both dispirited artiste and disaffected audience. As always, it's the artiste himself I care about--which is why I have no doubt he was a true star.
"
FALSE,C,My Own Way to Rock,Burton Cummings,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6665,"
This transparent egoist has had a way with a song ever since the Guess Who days, but the hard rock moves always seem to bring out the sexism in him--a sexism especially repellent because it serves as an outlet not for forbidden class animosities but rather for the familiar old arrogance/self-hate. So it's gratifying that his way with a song should desert him this time.

""In books/And films/And in life/And in heaven/The sound of slaughter/As your body turns . . .""--no, I can't go on. I mean, why so glum, chum? Cheer up; look on the bright side. You got your contract, right? And your synthesizers, bet you'll have fun with them. Believe me, kid, it will pass.

FALSE,C,Daltrey,Roger Daltrey,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6671,"
A good-looking lad with cinematic potential, but Peter Townshend chose him as the Who's front man partly because he doesn't have the personality or the smarts to assert himself as an interpreter. That goes even when another svengali--this one a collective comprising Dave Courtney, Adam Faith, and Leo Sayer--provides him with another frame. From anybody else, this would be one more dumb concept album (about the musician's lot, woe is me), and it still is.

The adventurous journeyman having long since turned into a professional reactionary, he here offers nine nominally new ways to kick shit down an Interstate divider. Including a hit single lifted from Stephen Vincent Benet, rock and roll heaven south of the Mason-Dixon line, passing criticism of the Ku Klux Klan, and a sentimental reminiscence of ""Mississippi,"" a state the adventurous journeyman fled in an uproar back when he didn't ride so easy.

As marketing, pure genius. Looks like alt-country, no electric guitars even, yet is actually America's answer to Silverchair. And hey, it's sincere--17-year-old heartland frontman Travis Meeks really is depressed, really has immersed in Soundgarden, really does think it's deep to hook your single to the all-purpose trope ""abuse."" This is why grown-ups need Hanson. It's also why they need Radish.

FALSE,C,Supernatural,DC Talk,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5046,"
If the scruffy yokels of Jars of Clay are tent preachers, these hunky moderns are televangelists, their well-riffed Queen homage the musical equivalent of Tammy Faye Bakker's false eyelashes--considered sinful excess in an earlier era, but claimed for Christ now that it is known not to herald the end time. Reports that they have something--anything--to do with rap are apparently based on the presence of a certified Black Person in the group. Instead, they do up a jolly ska tune whose love object is, shall we say, not female, and address a generically whiny-sarcastic selling-out put-down to Collective Soul, trumping their assertion of spiritual superiority by insisting that they still ""love"" their backsliding brothers. They should remember I Corinthians 13:4: ""Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.""

FALSE,C,The Hazards of Love,The Decemberists,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14911,"
Derided in such varied precincts as Pitchfork, Blender, and Entertainment Weekly when it stuck its head out of the quicksand last March, The Hazards of Love looked to be where Colin Meloy's obvious bad points permanently swallowed his subtle good points. But still the thing finished top 30 in The Village Voice's big critics' poll, so I can remain silent no longer. Except insofar as Colin Meloy's antiquarianism permits him to use such words as ""withers"" and ""blackguard"" (which he pronounces ""black-guard""--real pseudo-Elizabethans say ""blaggard,"" Colin), evokes online gaming and crypto-genteel '60s folk ensembles more than it does any kind of literature. He has the conceit to elevate melodies that are the musical equivalent of doggerel into mini-motives. His plot is so preposterous and unempathetic it's more the appearance of a plot, or an elaborate joke about a plot. And yet some fool in Britannia's highly respectable Observer thinks this album is ""as dazzling as it is beautiful."" Be vigilant. Be ever vigilant.

You know about the music, and if you don't think you'll like it you won't: impeccable pop metal of no discernible content, it will inspire active interest only in AOR programmers and the several million addicts of the genre. In short, it's product--but as product, significant, because it's product for the CD age. Stuck with over an hour of material after four years (after all, could twelve songs be any shorter?), they elected to put it all on one disc because as technocrats they instinctively conceive for formats that can accommodate an hour of music: cassettes, which now outsell vinyl discs, and CDs, which outdollar them. The cassette sound is a little too dim, as commercial cassette sound usually is, and though I sometimes find myself preferring the depth of the vinyl once I've turned my amp up to six or seven, the clarity of the CD gets more and more decisive as the needle approaches the outgroove. I mean, I have trouble perceiving these guys as human beings under ideal circumstances. Not docked a notch because at least they didn't pad it into a double.

FALSE,C,"Poems, Prayers and Promises",John Denver,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6695,"
Denver is everything an acoustic singer-songwriter might be--pretty, vapid, and commercial. ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" is a genuine pop archetype, and as an inhabitant of the temperate regions of earth I find that sunshine on my shoulder makes me happy, too. But usually his voice and his songs are tepid rather than temperate, as is the mid-'60s folk sensibility and stringless/hornless instrumentation. There's more originality and spirit in Tom Jones--maybe even Engelbert Humperdinck. If James is a wimp, John is a simp, and that's even worse.

This being 1970, DeShannon makes like the minor pop aristocrat she is with vague stabs at meaningfulness--in addition to a thickheaded ""Bird on the Wire"" and a cute peaceable-kingdom double-fold, there are lots of songs about her minor, aristocratic life. ""What Was Your Day Like"" is a sweet, factual, painfully ambiguous account of geographically unrequited love that would put me on the next plane--too late, probably. All I get from the rest is that she's been spending a lot of time in Europe.

Diop targets the New Age folkie escapists milked by his producer, TV-soundtrack titan Brian Keane, and the result has all the tensile strength of vanilla pudding. Admittedly, he's not the only African to utter a sentiment like ""We are all but flowers in the field/To nature's changing seasons we must yield/We only have but one season under the sun/We'd best take care before our time is done."" But usually African homilies are starker--and even when they aren't, they sound starker.

But since then it's anted up some eco-yens and gone pop by advertising a track on this deeply anonymous Britsynthpop full-length. I kept playing said full-length, expecting a big pickup four titles in. Only it never came--the whole thing got catchier, but ""Days Go By"" just didn't stand out like it does on TV.

A ""family man"" when he's explaining why he fled the 'hood, on the very next track Dre drips contempt for the wife he's dogging and the other husbands' wives he's sodomizing--apparently because his real-life wife told him that would be commercial, rendering him a liar more ways than Eminem himself could comprehend. For an hour, with time out for some memorable Eminem tracks, Dre degrades women every way he can think of, all of which involve his dick (""the whole eight,"" as this master of poetic license puts it). Best friend S. Dogg, bad speller Kurupt, and Dat 'Ho Ms. Roq are among the hangers-on who'll take his (really Eminem's) money when (and if) he writes the check. And just when you thought it was safe to discard your vomit bag he goes out on a tearjerker about a dead homey. Wottan innovator.

In the worst minstrel tradition of ignorant fantasies projected onto a dark-skinned Other, D-12's bum-fuck brutality and dumber-than-Durst humor provide a baseline Eminem can rise above in his sleep, as he promptly does.

Rather than getting all hot and heavy, Burbank's entry in the Ladies' Day Derby emulates the circa-1965 sound of groups like the Hollies and (says here) the Beatles. Execution is competent enough--axpersonship isn't an issue with the style.

On the evidence of these hits (the early albums were marginally livelier), she has nothing whatsoever to do with rock and roll or rhythm and blues and almost nothing to do with soul.

She made ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" and ""Killing Me Softly With His Song,"" he made ""Mandy"" and ""I Write the Songs,"" and who is to say which achievement will prove more durable?

Between the workaday saxophonist, the omnipresent bassist, the drummer named Future Man, the leader pursuing chord changes to new frontiers of musical forethought, and guests from such exotic climes as Tuva and Eire, how could we expect any less than bluegrass speed for speed's sake, world music meditation for meditation's sake, Phishy keybs, and fusion stop-and-go?

Hype is a word I try to use no more normatively than I do guitar--one's almost as intrinsic to rock and roll as the other. And this is a truly great hype. We're not just talking spectacularly entertaining, like the dripping labia of Mom's Apple Pie, or spectacularly profitable, like the Monkees, or both, like the ""Thriller"" video. We're talking hype as primary signifier, as a carrier of rich, profound, and potentially subversive meanings. I love the hype right down to the album package, and will even grant that the appalling quality of the band's music enriches the meaning further. But that doesn't mean I'm going to be caught dead telling anybody to listen to it. The singles side is okay--""Relax"" has proven itself a fetching fuck-mantra, ""Two Tribes"" is fair-to-middling political art. But on the whole Frankie are a marginally competent arena-rock band who don't know how to distinguish between effeminacy and pretension, like an English Grand Funk gone disco.

And indeed, Tony Banks's organ crescendos are less totalistic, Steve Hackett's guitar is audible, and Peter Gabriel's lyrics take on medievalism, real-estate speculators, and the history of the world. This latter is the apparent subject of the 22:57-minute ""Supper's Ready,"" which also suggests that Gabriel has a sense of humor and knows something about rock and roll.

So what's become of this minor innovator is kinda sad. It's not as if he overdoes the sexism or sounds like a total lame, although his voice does crack slightly on ""Even When I'm Mad."" But a man whose only quotable thought is ""I'd rather watch cable/Than see you with a negligee on"" has obviously gotten pretty dull himself. Even when he does spring for a beat from his onetime partner Timbaland, what he gets is strictly off the rack--unlike his pal Missy's cameo, which reminds you that 33 isn't old at all.

Granted, some of the fast ones are vaguely visionary in a rockpoety kind of way, and the eclecticism is total--this is a guy who listened with bated breath to every silly piece of contraband he could get his ears on. Probably he writes better in Russian; possibly Dave Stewart's unironic production gloss creates the wrong impression. But his art-folk filigrees and art-rock ostinatos, not to mention the Aching Lyricism of his voice itself, are more deja vu than anybody with access to media should be asked to stomach.

FALSE,C,21st Century Breakdown,Green Day,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14617,"
I tried, I swear. Played it over and over so the music would sink in before I assessed a concept unlikely to prove profound. That way I could give it up to individual tracks whatever the state of Billie Joe Armstrong's geopolitical acumen. But all this did was convince me that I disliked the tunes I remembered even more than those I didn't--especially the slow ones that set up the fast ones within the same song, a hotcha-gotcha device with which the Broadway-bound ex-punk is deeply smitten. I don't like right-wing Christianists either. But as every oppressed teen in the right-wing orbit knows full well, they're not as garbled and simplistic as Armstrong's anthems insist.
"
FALSE,C,Flavours,The Guess Who,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6957,"
The Burton Cummings part of this group always wanted it to be the Doors, Santana, and Gary Puckett and the Union Gap all rolled into one. This rather monstrous goal has finally been realized. Personally, I always preferred the part that wanted to be Bachman-Turner Overdrive.
"
FALSE,C,I Love Dixie Blues,Merle Haggard and the Strangers,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6968,"
The care Haggard put into his Jimmie Rodgers and Bob Wills tributes was palpable; this live-in-New Orleans-with-horns affair is slovenly. The two great moments are covers--""Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)"" and ""Lovesick Blues,"" both originated by the legendary (blackface?) yodeler Emmett Miller. The lousy moments include current hits, overstated polyphony, and (how did we stand the wait?) a third live version of ""Okie From Muskogee,"" this one a failed singalong.
"
FALSE,C,Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine,Daryl Hall,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4923,"
Bloated by endless codas, superfluous instrumentation, hall upon hall of vocal mirrors, and the artist's unshakable confidence that his talent makes him significant, these ten songs average almost five minutes apiece. Cut down to the trifles they are by a lightweight collaborator, they might qualify as likable pap. We'll never know.
"
FALSE,C,Southern Fried,John Hammond,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11523,"
Another Col. Sanders special from the white Taj Mahal. The playing is very good and Hammond's taste in blues-based material original enough, but his vocal style demeans his mentors. Otiose.
"
FALSE,C,Red Dirt Girl,Emmylou Harris,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5826,"
What a weird (dishonest? ironic? clueless?) name for a record that's all literature and arty sound effects. Even the title song, while indeed describing the white South of the artist's putative roots, balances on the fulcrum of a four-syllable word: Meridian, which joins allelujah, sanctuary, Antonia, and great big Michelangelo in reminding us that Harris has put away childish things. Instead we get a record worthy of her (to mush up review gush) ""celestial"" and ""eminent"" voice, one that ""shimmers with poetic imagery and soul."" Mortality, redemption, angels, all the important stuff, adorned with Daniel-Lanois-once-removed soundscape. Nary an antiwar song, yet you know Joan Baez is proud.
"
FALSE,C,All Things Must Pass,George Harrison,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6982,"
As a slave of the very ""MAYA"" (pidgin Hindi for the concrete world) Harrison warns against, I am obliged to point out that playing headsie with the Universal Mind is not introspection and that the International Pop Music Community is not a group. Presumably, the featurelessness of these three discs--right down to the anonymity of the multitracked vocals--reflects Harrison's notion of Truth, and he's welcome to it. But he's never been good for more than two songs per album, and after ""My Sweet Lord"" I start to get stuck.
"
FALSE,C,Living in the Material World,George Harrison,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6983,"
If you call this living. Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including a little man in my head who I never noticed before, have expressed intense gratitude when I turned the damned thing off during ""Be Here Now."" Inspirational sentiment: ""the leaders of nations/They're acting like big girls.""
"
FALSE,C,George Harrison,George Harrison,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6988,"
In which Harrison returns to good old commercial rock and roll, he says, presumably because he shared songwriting on one track with Gary ""Sure Shot"" Wright and let Russ Titleman produce. Well, there is a good song here--""Faster,"" about a kind of stardom. He remembers!
"
FALSE,C,Hot Buttered Soul,Isaac Hayes,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11530,"
This album is a smash, and it may be so overstated that it has its own validity--a baroque, luscious production job over the non-singing of one half of Sam &amp; Dave's production-songwriting team.
"
FALSE,C,The Isaac Hayes Movement,Isaac Hayes,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6993,"
I admit that his arrangements can be ""interesting""--my my my, a gypsy fiddle on ""Something""--but they'd be more so at a less stately pace than four songs per LP. And if his voice is best displayed when he talks, why doesn't he do a whole album of raps like the one preceding ""I Stand Accused""? Might be pretty funny.
"
FALSE,C,Dog and Butterfly,Heart,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6997,"
Georgia Christgau: ""Robert Plant understands his place as second-string guitar posing as lead singer. He should--he thought it up. But this idea is belittling to Ann Wilson. `I have a great voice!' her songs seem to say, and so she may--but what is it doing preening here among all these seamy heavy metal types?""
"
FALSE,C,Bad Animals,Heart,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4946,"
You'd never know Ann Wilson was riding the catchy intricacies of hired songwriting unless you listened more carefully than the resulting trifles deserve or her relentless overkill permits. And although the camp follower in me is sometimes tickled by the mismatch, it was the professional in me who noticed it. Only in the title cut, where a failed opera singer throws down the gauntlet for the heavy metal boors she's sworn to defend, does the end justify the means.
"
FALSE,C,Hidden Strength,Hidden Strength,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11521,"
I get to play this once every two or three months, when it works down to the end of the shelf. I put on side one and enjoy the easeful nonsense chorus of ""Happy Song."" But nothing else--including ""Hustle On Up (Do The Bump),"" which UA foolishly slotted for a disco breakout--catches my ear. Someone in a position of authority should listen to ""Happy Song."" It's nice.
"
FALSE,C,Cry,Faith Hill,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11915,"
Celine Dion comparisons are too huge to mean a damn thing, but only huge will do. Hill's singing is more ""human-scale""--like the female CEO of a Birmingham-based health-maintenance operation. Her drumming rocks--like RoboCop on steroids. She's an SUV that seats five linebackers across, a radio signal that grinds the competition into static, the megabomb they'll drop on anybody who doesn't get liberated on their timetable. At this horrible moment in history, she's American overkill as popular music. One thing you can say for Dion--she's Canadian.
"
FALSE,C,Pursuit of Happiness,Rupert Holmes,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7025,"
As a much-covered pop singer-songwriter who narrated well-crafted musical soap operas, Holmes earned neither popular not critical status. So now he's pursued fame by moving to an avowed singles label, jettisoning the narrative and steering between Jimmy Webb literacy at his best (""Less Is More"") and Paul Williams pap at his worst (""Speechless"").
"
FALSE,C,Scenes from the Southside,Bruce Hornsby and the Range,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4978,"
This unassuming platinum mine is compassionate, serious, literate. He plays a ""real"" piano. And he's a menace. I mean, in the privacy of your own mind, try crossing vague Bruce with '80s Elton. Then run it through Firefall. Finally--this is important--slow down those tempos. No no no, leave the drum sound up. See?
"
FALSE,C,The Phosphorescent Rat,Hot Tuna,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15194,"
After four albums, or is it five, this spin-off also sounds tired and like themselves, more consistent than their sister, and why does anyone care when they don't seem to? At least when they were doing country blues the material justified the music's indolence.
"
FALSE,C,Cissy Houston,Cissy Houston,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7037,"
The sharpest pleasure afforded by the Sweet Inspiration was the juxtaposition of Cissy's rather vulgar pull-out-the-stops melodrama against genteel if kinetic arrangements and material. The voice is almost as interesting as it used to be, but the juxtaposition no longer works, perhaps because new producers Koppelman and Rubin don't know the difference between gentility and complacent meaninglessness.
"
FALSE,C,Whitney Houston,Whitney Houston,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4982,"
I'd never claim that this sweet, statuesque woman and her sweet, statuesque voice are victims of exploitation. She obviously believes in this schlock. But not counting the Jermaine Jackson duet from his own Arista debut, only one of the four producers puts any zip in--Narada Michael Walden, who goes one for one. And it could have been worse--they could have sicked Barry Manilow on her the way they did with cousin Dionne. Then the credits could have read: ""To Barry Manilow, It was a privilege to work with a talented professional who's made so many millions of dollars for Clive Davis. Together, we can make many millions more.""
"
FALSE,C,Nickelodeon,Hudson-Ford,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7038,"
""Complain about pollution, the downfall of man/And half-grown humans may be your fans/Add your shit to the pile while you still can/Cause it's hell on earth."" Hudson-Ford, ""Burn Baby Burn"" (Slick Cynic Music, ASCRAP, additional lyric by R. Christgau, Two Minute Songs, LAMF).
"
FALSE,C,Freedom for the Stallion,The Hues Corporation,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7039,"
There's no way ""Rock the Boat"" could prepare you for the studied lameness of this LP unless you believe, as I do, that ersatz gospel liveliness doesn't validate the hit of 1974 any more than ersatz gospel beautifulness validated the hit of 1969. (That's a quiz.) Exception: ""The Family,"" which studies hard. (Answer to quiz: ""Oh Happy Day."")
"
FALSE,C,Hysteria,Human League,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4986,"
It's clear enough that despite aural appearances Phil Oakey does have feelings, but so do BBC news readers, and nobody expects them to lead popular singing groups. If these Yoo Kay yuppies are really hysterical, they're also dangerously repressed. Polite hooks feh.
"
FALSE,C,The Tight Connection,I Am the World Trade Center,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11916,"
If they changed their name, that would mean the major labels had won. Also that seekers after the dark wouldn't buy bad laptop Blondie by mistake.
"
FALSE,C,Rebel Yell,Billy Idol,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4994,"
Videos have been the making of this born poser's career and the unmaking of his music. Not that they've changed how hard and hooky it is, much less turned off the unwitting many who find sexism sexy. But if you've got no taste for the sound of the sneer, the visuals definitely aren't fantasy enough.
"
FALSE,C,(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right,Luther Ingram,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11490,"
Great single--anyone who recalls ""My Honey and Me"" knows that Ingram runs into his share of good material--but in his Memphis way he's as colorless as Jack Jones.
"
FALSE,C,She's the Boss,Mick Jagger,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5043,"
History may absolve him. Jeff Beck earns his fucked-up legend here, and Bill Laswell puts together several bands--like Beck-Martinez-Hancock-Shakespeare-Dunbar-Ponce on ""Running Out of Luck""--that should only tour. So maybe a hundred years from now folks who've never read People will admire the timbral virtuosity and breath control of the man atop the tracks. But Jagger has become such an overbearing public presence that I for one find it impossible to care about his romantic vagaries no matter how hard he leather-lungs. It would be going too far, unfortunately, to say he's a joke. But the only thing left for him to do with his persona is burlesque it, which is why the title track is the only one that's any fun. And as my wife complains, he probably thinks it describes the way things are with him and Jerry.
"
FALSE,C,Glow,Rick James,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5063,"
Rick has never been Mr. IQ, but this record is so stupid--not stoopid, just plain stupid--that his continuing failure to conquer MTV seems more disgraceful than ever. I mean, with his monotonous hooks, one-dimensional beat, fop coiffure, and relentless sexual self-aggrandizement, that's clearly where he belongs--he may be smarmier than Billy Idol, but what's a little grease among professionals?
"
FALSE,C,Passin' Thru,James Gang,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7100,"
Okay, boys, just as long as you're out of town by sundown. And Troiano, leave your guitar with me. That Walsh feller, he was a gentleman, but there's no tellin' what you'll be shootin' off next.
"
FALSE,C,Smile,The Jayhawks,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4849,"
The Jayhawks without Mark Olson don't resemble the Flying Burrito Brothers without Gram Parsons so much as Poco without Richie Furay. Not that they were ever as fluffy as Poco (or as chewy as the Burritos). But now they're as vapid as late Poco and then some. Although specifics do assert themselves, like when the drummer sings or the inspirational title cut references some northern clime, Gary Louris's boys aspire to the generalization level of transcendentalist parlor ballads, Hallmark cards, and, increasingly, Music Row. Alt- and any other kind of country behind them, they praise the Bob Ezrin who produced Alice Cooper and hire the one who produced Air Supply.
"
FALSE,C,Spitfire,Jefferson Starship,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7111,"
I still respect this group, I really do. Their apparently random yet inexorable evolution as a collective entity (not just Grace &amp; Paul Plus) resonates in their deepening textures. They seem to have ideals. You might even say they keep '60s notions of communality alive. Or are they just accommodating '70s notions of corporate identity? They're so vague--they meaning the people, the ideals, and on this album even the textures--that it's hard to tell. Or care.
"
FALSE,C,Earth,Jefferson Starship,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7113,"
This is slightly better than Spitfire (not to mention Baron von Tollbooth) and rather worse than Red Octopus (not to mention Crown of Creation). Its only ambitious lyric seems to equate skateboarding with sex with (male) hubris; its expertness conceals neither schlock nor shtick nor strain of ego. It is leading the nation in FM airplay.
"
FALSE,C,Ladies Love Outlaws,Waylon Jennings,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10957,"
Waylon lets you know he has balls by singing as though someone is twisting them.
"
FALSE,C,Piano Man,Billy Joel,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7123,"
Joel's Cold Spring Harbor was recorded in the vicinity of 38-rpm to fit all the material on--he's one of these eternal teenagers who doesn't know how to shut up. Stubborn little bastard, too--after his bid stiffed, he worked a Los Angeles cocktail lounge soaking up Experience. Here he poses as the Irving Berlin of narcissistic alienation, puffing up and condescending to the fantasies of fans who spend their lives by the stereo feeling sensitive. And just to remind them who's boss, he hits them with a ballad after the manner of Aaron Copland.
"
FALSE,C,Streetlife Serenade,Billy Joel,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7124,"
Boy, these piano boys--on ""Root Beer Rag"" and ""The Mexican Connection"" Joel abandons Irving Berlin for George Gershwin, or do I mean Roger Williams? Granted, ""The Entertainer"" is so nasty it's witty--so nasty it may be about Joel himself. But why does it include a Rick Wakeman imitation?
"
FALSE,C,Madman Across the Water,Elton John,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7130,"
The two decent songs here--I refer primarily to the melodies of ""Tiny Dancer"" (just how small is she, anyway?) and ""Levon""--clock in (with lots and lots of help from Paul Buckmaster) at 6:12 and 5:37 respectively. In other words, they meander. The others maunder as well. Ugh.
"
FALSE,C,Here and There,Elton John,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7137,"
I had a syllogism worked out on this one. Went something like a) all boogie concerts rock on out, b) Elton is best when he rocks on out, c) therefore Elton's concert LP will rank with his best. So if this sounds like slop (concert-slop and Elton-slop both), blame Socrates--or find the false premise.
"
FALSE,C,Blue Moves,Elton John,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7136,"
None of the few rockers on this impossibly weepy and excessive double-LP match anything on Rock of the Westies. Or, as my wife commented in all innocence of who was on: ""What is this tripe?""
"
FALSE,C,A Single Man,Elton John,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7139,"
Like the homophilophile I am, I'm rooting for Elton, but though this isn't as lugubrious as Blue Moves, it comes close, and the flat banalities of new lyricist Gary Osborne make Bernie Taupin's intricate ones sound like Cole Porter. Personal to Reg Dwight: Rock and roll those blues away.
"
FALSE,C,Uptown Shakedown,Syl Johnson,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7145,"
Some worthy soul veterans turn disco into commercial or even artistic regeneration. Others don't. For Johnson, who here abandons the rough, bluesy intensity of Total Explosion, disco means compromised semi-contemporaneity. ""Mystery Lady"" (she wears a mask) and ""Let's Dance for Love"" affect post-hustle hipness but don't achieve it, lyrically or musically, which may be why the Otis Redding medley and the Brenton Wood cover sound so half-assed.
"
FALSE,C,The Johnstons,The Johnstons,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11481,"
What do you call it when an honest and political Irish folk duo adds strings and horn arrangements for no perceivable purpose, including increased sales? How about sham-rock?
"
FALSE,C,Bulletproof Heart,Grace Jones,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5101,"
The title means nothing, because without giving up her stentorian tendencies, the dominatrix is here reborn as love bunny. ""Seduction Surrender,"" ""Amado Mio,"" ""Love on Top of Love,"" ""Someone to Love,"" ""Paper Plan"" with its ""marriage of the heart,"" even ""Kicked Around""--all proclaim her vulnerability and/or softness of orifice. The effect is so incongruous that when she quotes Nancy Reagan on crack (never say she has no social conscience), there's only one answer. No, Grace--no!
"
FALSE,C,Heart Land,The Judds,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5114,"
This which-one-had-the-baby mother-and-daughter act was cute for about fifteen minutes. They've long since revealed themselves as neotraditionalism's most shameless nostalgia pimps, and the only way their sexual politics could get more disgusting is if their songwriters slipped them wife-swapping jokes. To honor this achievement, their label herewith institutes a nine-track limit for country LPs. I remember when twelve down to eleven was a scandal, and submit that in this case like so many others zero might be a more socially responsible target.
"
FALSE,C,Sunfighter,Paul Kantner/Grace Slick,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7166,"
More sci-fi rev and Tamalpaian grandeur from Frisco's royal family. I dig the cover and the two Grace Slick songs, though not the way she keens them, but the rest of this is Paulie II picking his nose.
"
FALSE,C,House of Pain,Sarah Kernochan,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11436,"
The lyrics looked so great--like good words, not bad poetry--that I put the record on instantly, only to recoil seconds later. Admittedly, I got used to this mannered (ill-mannered?) music eventually; but I recommend a year of live audiences before her next studio date.
"
FALSE,C,Friends,B.B. King,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7181,"
If Dave Crawford really wants to turn B.B. into a major ""contemporary"" soul singer, he shouldn't make him sing Dave Crawford's songs. Best cut: the instrumental.
"
FALSE,C,Rhymes and Reasons,Carole King,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7189,"
The melodies retain their overall charm, but because the lyrics continue their retreat, the hooks, such as they are, never jolt the expectations.
"
FALSE,C,Wrap Around Joy,Carole King,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7191,"
The good news is that Carole's new lyricist used to work with Steely Dan. The bad news is that in Steely Dan he was a vocalist.
"
FALSE,C,Islands,King Crimson,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7200,"
Just as I was learning to hear past the bullshit they upped the ante, so fuck 'em. When I feel the need for contemporary chamber music or sexist japes, jazz libre or vers ordinaire, I'll go to the source(s).
"
FALSE,C,Standing in the Spotlight,Dee Dee King,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5139,"
He does have his own style--not even Deborah Harry would dare rap over such one-dimensional beats--and I like ""Too Much To Drink,"" the latest in the surprising spate of rock temperance anthems. But Dee Dee, we German-Americans believe in grammar. You're not ""the baddest rapper in Whitestone, Queens""--you're ""the worst rapper in Whitestone, Queens.""
"
FALSE,C,After All This Time,Bonnie Koloc,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7230,"
On the first side she wishes to combine Grace Slick's priestess with Joan Baez's bowdlerizing aesthete, and the strain is gruesome, especially on the high notes. On the second side she shows the makings of a likable folkie, especially on a blues she wrote herself. But the high notes are still a strain.
"
FALSE,C,Follow the Leader,Korn,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1960,"
Korn deny they're metal; that's Judas Priest, all four-four pomp and guitar solos. But they nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal--an expressive mode it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary whiteboys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat--is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display. Now calling up death-metal's signature groan to prove only to prove he's authentic, poor not-actually-abused Jonathan Davis raps, recites, scats, and sings dull tunes landscaped with eerie licks, odd bridges, and a hyperactive rhythm section. How much his fans identify with ""My Gift to You"" (""I kiss your lifeless skin""), ""Cameltosis"" (""You trick-ass slut""), or the tragic ""Seed"" (""Do I need this fame?"") remains unclear. But I'm parent enough to hope they can find a more fully formed designated someone than a guy whose idea of transgressive art is netcasting soft-core s&amp;m to any teenager with a logon.
"
FALSE,C,5,Lenny Kravitz,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2033,"
His racially convoluted formalism having long since come clean as a total absence of original ideas, he grabs the brass ring from the back of a tacked-on Guess Who cover best heard on the far more imaginative Austin Powers soundtrack. Lenny, your work here on earth is done. We've got Derek Jeter now.
"
FALSE,C,Kristofferson,Kris Kristofferson,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7240,"
""Me and Bobby McGee"" is only the beginning--this former Rhodes scholar is as deft and common as any songwriter in Nashville, though he's better off keeping it personal with a heartbreak song like ""For the Good Times"" than justifying his scruffy appearance with penny-ante satire like ""Blame It on the Stones."" But he's the worst singer I've ever heard. It's not that he's off key--he has no relation to key. He also has no phrasing, no dynamics, no energy, no authority, no dramatic ability, and no control of the top two-thirds of his six-note range. Recommended to demo collectors.
"
FALSE,C,Songs of Kristofferson,Kris Kristofferson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7242,"
Over the years, Kristofferson has learned enough about acting to challenge George Burns as a crooner, although the veteran is stronger in the rebop department. It's conceivable he might even do somewhat better now on some of his great early songs. But not on this glorified repackage.
"
FALSE,C,K,Kula Shaker,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5934,"
What Happy Mondays did for substance abuse these fools vow to accomplish for spirit abuse. Drunk on Krishna, they take an anonymously commonplace chorus-guitar melange and stir in some sitar/tabla/tamboura and banalities I hope aren't translated from the Hindi. Bet it wouldn't occur to Cornershop to inform Billboard that Indians are ""content"" because they have ""faith."" Kaleidoscope either.
"
FALSE,C,Labelle,Labelle,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7246,"
I find this group's mystique mysterious. Unlike most girl groups they boast a lady-soul front woman, but so do the Sweet Inspirations. They can trade leads like the Temptations, but rarely bother. They have their own songwriter, but she hasn't written any good songs. And though I too prefer their style of upward mobility to the Supremes', it's mostly aura--a matter of costuming and melodrama. I like what they do with ""Wild Horses""--maybe the way to save that overstated metaphor is to overstate it some more. But too often they change the beauty of the melody until it sounds just like an op-e-ra.
"
FALSE,C,Moon Shadow,Labelle,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7247,"
Nine songs--six by Nona Hendryx, one by Sarah Dash, and one each by Peter Townshend and Cat Stevens. The latter two lead off each side. And are easily the pick of the record. Cat Stevens.
"
FALSE,C,Phoenix,Labelle,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11601,"
Maybe if Patti came a little more like the falling rain and a little less like a water main these songs about quasars and amazing birds wouldn't sound so gushy. Exception: ""Far As We Felt Like Goin'"" which Nona Hendryx didn't write.
"
FALSE,C,5 Live,Robin Lane & the Chartbusters,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5343,"
A new wave demands new gimmicks, and bizzers have been working overtime to create them.  For the big guys they long ago came up with the redundant live double. So for the little guys they've devised the redundant live half.
"
FALSE,C,Twelve Deadly Cyns,Cyndi Lauper,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8707,"
The statistics are brutal. The six best tracks on this 10-year retrospective, arrayed all in a row after a bombastic new Mann-Weil cover, are all from her decade-old debut, and if ""When You Were Mine"" had been thrown in the figure would have been seven. So you decide--wanna buy this for ""True Colors"" and ""I Think About You""? I thought not, and that was without mentioning the ""Girls"" remix or the Mary Chapin Carpenter song about pigeons. Maybe she was so set on fun because she guessed it would be hell from there on in.

FALSE,C,Some Time in New York City,John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7267,"
Half caterwauling live weirdness with the Mothers of Invention, half tuneless topical rock songs with Elephant's Memory, this is where Lennon risks his charisma instead of investing it. I like its rawness and its basic good-heartedness, though J&amp;Y's politics are frequently condescending. But if agitprop is one thing and wrong-headed agitprop another, agitprop that doesn't reach its intended audience is hardly a thing at all.

FALSE,C,Valotte,Julian Lennon,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5366,"
I'd hoped to let this one die in dignified silence--figured you couldn't blame the boy for trying. But as it's now sold over 500,000 RIAA-certified copies, discretion is useless. Anyway, I do blame him for trying. Aside from the eerie vocal resemblance, this is bland professional pop of little distinction and less necessity--tuneful at times, tastefully produced of course, and with no discernible reason for being, more Frank Sinatra Jr. than (even) Hank Williams Jr. Julian seems well brought up, a credit to his long-suffering mom. I suggest he invest his royalties in medical school--or else, if he's so keen on not wasting his genetic heritage, launch a career in the visual arts.

FALSE,C,Kings of Crunk,Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12237,"
Buried on this cruddy album is a great gimmick half perfected on the climactic ""Get Low"": oi anthems gone south, crude and compelling unison chants about flexing muscle in a club where another clique does something you don't like, such as breathe. Socially retrograde, but so was tango, and Lil's namesake Elton beat him to the theme by three decades. What's truly retrograde is the rapping--when Too Short takes a turn you'd think Rakim had dropped in from paradise--and the pimp shit eaten by boy-toy-for-hire Oobie and bull mackstress Chyna Whyte. As if in illustration, this version of ""Get Low"" includes an indistinct verse about stupid bitches poppin' pussy on a pole. It's omitted from both remixes on the new Part II. They knew what to do. Now you do too.

FALSE,C,Mouth to Mouth,"Lipps, Inc.",1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5380,"
How can bizzers moan about the downfall of disco with this Silver Convention homage bigger than the Royal Guardsmen? Auteur named Steven Greenberg, medium named Cynthia Johnson, funky town named Minneapolis, thirty long minutes, one great hook. An accountant's dream.

FALSE,C,A Place in the Sun,Lit,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5313,"
Led by two Orange County lads whose dad was a pop DJ, they like Vegas and old Cadillacs, make too much of their play on ""come,"" ""complete,"" and ""completely miserable,"" and serve as a dull-dull-dull reminder to anyone besotted with Blink 182 that punk in itself guaranteed nothing even in the days of the Real Kids and the Suicide Commandos.

FALSE,C,Freedom No Compromise,Little Steven,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5386,"
There are good singers who moan and good singers who whine, but this doomed soul is neither. He's just a guy who longs to let all the love and pain and ambition inside him out, and who isn't even any good at imitating those who know how. Civic virtue, rhythmic responsibility, sartorial overkill--none of them will gain him an ounce more popular credibility than he's already gained on the coattails of this icon or that issue. As usual, it's only as a writer of protest songs that he shows any knack--Rubï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""Bitter Fruit"" the way Black Uhuru did ""Solidarity,"" and without Steven's phony accent. One hell of an expensive demo.
"
FALSE,C,Roll On,The Living End,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6206,"
So whatever happened to that Clash-sounding '80s band from Switzerland, I forget their name? Right now I wish I knew. Presumably they didn't turn into an Alarm-acting '00s band from Australia, because these Melbourne laddies are Young, you bet, and also Indigenous in their Anglo-Saxon way, imbued with ""the Rose Tattoo and AC/DC [in their rock dreams--ed.] and the Angels."" Notice they don't mention INXS or Midnight Oil, relevant in their unfettered ambition and feckless idealism, respectively. Nor is the latter anything to write Stone about. Of the approximately four political songs, only the immigration-keyed ""Don't Shut the Gate"" is effective even artistically, and the antiunion tack of the opener, however well justified by specifics, is a bad sign. It's no fun to point out that dumb bands give agitprop a bad name. But they do.

FALSE,C,I Came to Dance,Nils Lofgren,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7295,"
In which the aging prodigy flirts with hackdom and almost scores. He still makes killer licks sound easy, although the melodies are drying up fast, and despite an ominous piece of Inspirational Verse--""I'll play guitar all night and day, just don't ask me to think""--and a road song that sounds like the first of a series, there's more ambitious lyric-writing here than on either of the two previous A&amp;M LPs. Thing is, except for ""Happy Ending Kids"" and a sly ditty about eating pussy, the lyrics don't work; whether ""Jealous Gun"" is straight anti-hunting propaganda or an allegory about who knows what, its language is stillborn and its pretensions annoying.

That would be 58, since he brought it up. Geezer's seven months to the good side of Robert Plant, who you'd never know was showing more savoir faire from the way bloggerati who weren't alive when ""Marie Prevost"" was written fawn over this labour of louche. Reborn as a crooner because he can't rev up the rock anymore, he can't rev up the croon either. Wit: Shot. Insouciance: Shot. Romantic prospects: On this evidence, shot. If you're worried about aging gracefully, maybe it's back to Elvis C. after all.

FALSE,C,Pop Muzik,M,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7312,"
Not only did the single break the new wave/disco barrier, it packed an instant wallop worthy of its title--you could hear it explode up the charts from moment of impact. All that's audible here is Robin Scott straining to duplicate his own lighthearted, worldly-wise eclecticism and exposing himself as a hopeless dilettante in the process.

If it weren't for the two great singles--""Shot by Both Sides"" (available on Real Life, now also released domestically) and ""I Love You You Big Dummy"" (a B-side Beefheart cover)--I'd be certain this was the most overrated band in new-wave Britain. And given the grandiose arrangements, ululating vocals, and published-poet lyrics, I'm pretty sure anyway. Back in the good old days we had a word for this kind of thing--pretentious.

McLaughlin was right to decide to revamp. But hiring a vocalist, a string section, Michael Tilson-Thomas, and the London Symphony Orchestra isn't revamping. It's spiritual pride pure and simple--or else impure and complicated.

It was made in Johannesburg, and that's a triumph. But unless you live there yourself, which means taking your uplift wherever you find it, save this genteel schlock for your Afrocentric grandma, who may not appreciate the gesture--she knows how much vague promises are worth. Even if you ignore the corny crossover lyrics, the all-purpose synthesizers, and the received licks from many lands, Dorothy Masuka is singing better, and without dated stabs at modernization. Dizzy Gillespie don't sound so hot either.
"
FALSE,C,Manilow II,Barry Manilow,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11690,"
Manilow arouses all the distrust that a man who achieved affluence making advertising music deserves: even if he is as sentimental sometimes, as his hit would indicate, he has no right to be. Nevertheless, a couple of songs written with someone named Enoch Anderson, who must deserve better, stick with me. The jingle strikes again?
"
FALSE,C,Singin' With the Big Bands,Barry Manilow,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8710,"
Tempting though it would be to tweak reformed Halo of Flies fans for going gaga over Tony Bennett, the wily codger's as prudent as ever about deploying his lovingly preserved pipes. Trevor Horn's Tom Jones joke travesties an artist who's always clocked dollars making fun of himself. But this guy's got a nerve. It's less ghoulish than some ""Unforgettable""-style computer nightmare in which Barry magically replaces Martha Tilton or Tex Beneke on classic swing records, but it's also worse--swing as '50s television music, stupefying chestnuts (three each from Sinatra and the Andrews Sisters, what taste), backed by recreated or reconceived live big band arrangements (sometimes from the original bands, whatever that can mean after 50 years, more often from ""the Big Band Orchestra""). Fronted, of course, by Manilow's uncompromisingly inoffensive voice--a voice that never hints at sex or history or even chops. Incomprehensible Press Quote: ""'I've found a funkiness and intelligence in the music that will last forever. Hopefully, everyone can feel the honesty and grit on the album that will remind us of what a hip era this was.'""
"
FALSE,C,The Roaring Silence,Manfred Mann's Earth Band,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7350,"
Side two is so slavish in its heavy-metal pretensions that it sounds like a parody that doesn't come off. Which is why I'm inclined to give up on this band and describe side one as two worthy songs stretched out of shape on a synthesizer. If this is what the audience Mann has found on tour wants, he should retreat to the studio.
"
FALSE,C,Chances Are,Bob Marley,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5411,"
Compiled from what executive producer Danny Sims claims are unreleased 1968-1972 tracks and Sims's adversaries claim are overdubbed 1968-1972 demos, this is grave-robbing either way. Neither songs nor singing are what you'd call exquisite, and while the production shares certain of its awkwardnesses with the Marley-penned reggae that Sims' old partner Johnny Nash laid down after ""I Can See Clearly Now,"" it's busier and rougher--busier and rougher than pre-Catch a Fire Wailers, too. Musically, there's often not much difference between unreleased tracks and overdubbed demos.
"
FALSE,C,Ricky Martin,Ricky Martin,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5314,"
The boy-group boom is harmless-if-bad. Martin is more like bad-if-not-worse. Since he was already marked for death with Menudo, don't be so sure his rebirth is a one-shot. But don't make him a Latin-pride poster boy either. Slicked-up rhythm workouts and romantic pap were tokens of progress circa Xavier Cugat and Desi Arnaz. In an America where Spanish is a second language, they're the reactionary strategems of one more crappy pop star.

FALSE,C,Headkeeper,Dave Mason,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7359,"
A year and a half and three abortive collaborations later--this guy is a love expert?--he's back on the market with five new studio songs and five old live ones, two from Traffic and three from Alone Together. He claims this is his label's idea. Should have stayed with Mama Cass. Or better still, brother Derek.
"
FALSE,C,It's Like You Never Left,Dave Mason,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7361,"
Once again Mason, whose music has all but disappeared amid corporate machinations over the past few years, can offer new material in finished studio versions, and I bet he's genuinely happy about it. The vague romantic dolor of his songs, after all, is a professional gimmick rather than a personal commitment, and the welcome-back-folks title probably expresses his very deepest feelings. But for me it's like I was never here in the first place.
"
FALSE,C,Second Spring,Matthews' Southern Comfort,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7366,"
Disappointed though I am by the folky localism cum chauvinism of recent Pentangle and Fairport, Matthews's mid-Atlantic compromise is worse. Basically, he's James Taylor--without the whine, which I'd consider a real improvement if I could imagine Taylor ""interpreting"" the bitter ""Jinkson Johnson"" so bright and upbeat it sounded like Poco.

FALSE,C,Sweet Exorcist,Curtis Mayfield,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7374,"
No, Curtis has not latched onto another lucrative soundtrack. In fact, he claims to have written his exorcist song (about a female sexorcist) before there was an exorcist movie. He could have avoided this confusion by calling the album ""To Be Invisible"" after its only interesting song, from the less lucrative Claudine soundtrack, where Gladys Knight sings it better than him. Mayfield's next lp: The Great Ratsby.
"
FALSE,C,McCartney II,Paul McCartney,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5427,"
Paulie's 1970 DIY sounded homemade--its unfinished musings intimated an appealingly modest freedom. This one was recorded on a sixteen-track with an engineer in attendance. The instrumentals are doodles, the songs demos by a man who scores the occasional hit only to prove he's a genius. Which he isn't.
"
FALSE,C,Thinking of Woody Guthrie,Country Joe McDonald,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11065,"
It's the concept of this album that I don't like. Musically, it's not bad--a nice selection of Woody's tunes rendered agreeably by Joe and some Nashville sidemen. As an educational project I suppose it could be called, er, worthwhile. But anyone who has read this far may consider himself educated; the real thing is easy to swallow and can be purchased at better record shops.
"
FALSE,C,Megan Music,Megan McDonough,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7391,"
A male pianist cowrote a few of these songs, presumably concentrating on the melodies, since the lyrics run the gamut from rock music to rock bands to failed love affairs, most of them with rock musicians. Maybe she should find another scene. But then maybe she couldn't be a singer-songwriter. Best line: ""But babe I get lost taking off my sweater.""

Despite the occasional Byrdsy guitar run, this is pure supersession, a purposeful AOR move by pros out for a quick killing, anonymously accomplished in the music and contentless in the lyrics. Granted, McGuinn's vocals are outstanding--look at the company he's keeping--and his ""Don't You Write Her Off"" is a genuine grabber. But it's also the simplest thing on the record. Moral: at least you can make having nothing to say sound like fun.

FALSE,C,Paris,Malcolm McLaren,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5922,"
Situationism? Get real.

It didn't sell--why in the world should it? Problem is, the old hustler is beyond sales. All he wants is loads of publicity and enough of somebody else's money to get Catherine Deneuve within range of a copped feel. Presumably, Deneuve can ""Features nine-track bonus CD containing ambient remixes.""

FALSE,C,The Eagle and the Poodle,Mecca Normal,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5936,"
Humorless, devoid of rebop, admired by a pretentious minority of an alt-rock subculture already way too full of itself, Jean Smith is a typical avant-garde hustler, her self-promotion harmless as long as innocent bystanders don't get guilt-tripped into deciding she gives them a thrill. I prefer her poetry to her songs because it's over faster, and because I can absorb it without hearing David Lester's freeee guitar. Naive interviewer (and jerk): ""Do you listen to any music that you would consider obscure or different?"" Smith: ""I'm not really into all that record crap to tell you the truth.""
"
FALSE,C,"Melton, Levy and the Dey Brothers","Melton, Levy and the Dey Brothers",1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15527,"
Barry Melton, once the energetic young comer behind Country Joe, has done a classic Marin County cool-out. He always loved soul music, so now he makes laid-back soul music. I prefer Gamble and Huff. A sly, plaintive road song, ""Highway 1,"" wasn't written by anyone in the band, and the rest varies between pleasant and unremarkable. Melton's previous solo album was tasteless, but at least it had some passion.
"
FALSE,C,Stoner Witch,Melvins,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5910,"
I know why they retain their aura of hip. It's because the drummer comes from Aberdeen and used to play in Nir . . . no no, that can't be it--oh, I remember, it's that they're pure. They're always slow, always ugly, always protodeath, always protoindustrial. And always slow. Faster here, actually, up to Sabbath speed at times, with nine minutes of din at the end to shore up their cred. If you're young and depressed and too bright or not too bright, this sound may speak to your condition, and far be it from me to suggest volunteering for Rock the Vote instead. The rest of us can read about them.

FALSE,C,Electric Black Man,Eric Mercury,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7422,"
All things considered--tasteless hype, demeaning concept, kudos from David Clayton-Thomas, violins-and-wah-wah production, oh, the exploitative stupidity of it all--this isn't a complete disaster, because Mercury is a fairly strong singer. Maybe some day he'll put out a fairly strong album.
"
FALSE,C,Lee Michaels,Lee Michaels,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11534,"
Michaels, a talented singer-organist from California, has been trying for years and is beginning to develop a name on sheer persistence. His previous two albums have been somewhat over produced, but solid, even though he has never proved he can do it all by himself, which is his ambition. This one was cut, as the ads tell us, in seven hours. That may be okay for the Beatles but doesn't make it here. Drummer Bartholomew Smith-Frost stretches things out with two drum breaks ad Michaels' organ is often inflated. The final track, ""Heighty Ho,"" now released in a half-length version as a single, is marvelously catchy and ebullient, but doesn't justify the rest.

FALSE,C,The Trials of Van Occupanther,Midlake,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13598,"
The prestige of this conjunction of pomo prog, alt-country, fantasy fiction and video-game narrativity is the silliest proof yet of how jaded indie's tastebuds have become, with candied cannabis and lark's wings in aspic impending. Because Tim Smith has a sweet voice and a decent heart and his formerly psychedelic bandmates can negotiate moderately complex arrangements without twisting their ankles, this unfathomable concept album about loneliness on some olde frontier is compared to ""classic rock""--Fleetwood Mac especially. Putting that band's eponymous rhythm section aside, one wonders just which of these songs might entrance the common folk like, for instance, ""Go Your Own Way."" Perhaps the first and catchiest, in which Smith as Occupanther laments that he isn't named Roscoe. There's a sentiment all can share. Roscoe Smith. We'll have this fellow playing da blooze yet.

FALSE,C,Broken Blossom,Bette Midler,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7432,"
So she can translate Billy Joel into Phil Spector--she has nevertheless become, at least on record, just another pop singer, albeit with a few interesting idea. I ask you, is the redemption of Billy Joel fit work for a culture heroine?
"
FALSE,C,Them Changes,Buddy Miles,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7439,"
His work on Band of Gypsies and Devotion surpasses anything he ever did with the Electric Flag, but that's due to the artistic maturity of Hendrix and McLaughlin, not of Buddy Miles. His singing is too thin to carry two consecutive cuts, his drumming has to be exploited by subtler musicians, and the title cut is the only decent song he ever wrote.

Anyone naive enough to believe there's nothing more distasteful than a middle-aged man pretending his hormones are too much for him has never encountered a middle-aged man trying to act cute.

Frank Farian's great Eurodisco experiment Boney M didn't go over Stateside for the simple reason that it was too Euro. His Eurorap is hipper, sexier, even a teensy bit soulful--in short, indistinguishable from the highest quality Amerischlock give or take some snazzy sound effects. The title cut is the best cut.

As a joke about disco and a joke about heavy, Al Jourgenson's dance-industrial had some wit to it.

Me is Mark, Mr. Ray is Ray, rhythm section is gone. Unidentified toilers back the pleasant tracks; the unpleasant ones are all voice, bad poetry, and instrumental accompaniment. It gets worse than "". . . you could be my Venus/I'll close my eyes and hold my ears and walk up to a broken heart,"" but only rarely does it wuss out in your face like that--usually Mark's more obscure.

Without David Crosby's production--this is basically a voice-and-acoustic record--Joni's voice sounds malnourished, which it is. Three excellent songs, but two of them, ""Both Sides Now"" and ""Chelsea Morning,"" have been done better elsewhere. (By the way, nightclub singer Gloria Loring's version of ""Chelsea Morning"" is better than Judy Collins'.) The other one is called ""Roses Blue.""

Dreaming, fabulizing, playing the ingenue, speaking for the displaced Native American, preaching about materialism and ecocatastrophe and the engines of war (and abortion, though not so's you can tell where she stands), she's matured into a sententious liberal. Give me the Poet of the Me Decade any day. At least Joan Baez is a sententious radical.

Young Glaswegians extolled by those weary of verse-chorus-verse as ""radical,"" ""beautiful,"" and other things that would never occur to the rest of us, they mutate the forgettable mess of their debut into something altogether more deliberate and kempt-occasionally tuneful, invariably slow. Only on the oceanbound land mass where acid house was Beatlemania would anyone sit still for such earnest post-rock tripe.

FALSE,C,Tres Cosas,Juana Molina,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12471,"
With Argentina well over on the European edge of ""Latin""--which is mostly African whatever its Spanish antecedents--it's no surprise that this reformed television actress should trick up her boring strummed singer-songwritering with not terribly interesting electronica.  With the market for both modes desperate for marginal differentiation, it's also no surprise that she gets a bump for being exotic if not literally dark-skinned.  Needless to say, there are no surprises anywhere else either. That really isn't how soundscaping is supposed to work.

Subtitle: ""Music by the Doors."" Auxiliary subtitle: ""Poems, Lyrics and Stories by James Douglas Morrison."" Like every Morrison exploitation, this one is done with love--the Doors play like they've never been away. What it exploits, however, is a bad poet who got a chance to jack off with both hands when he didn't have to carry a tune. If you think lines like ""Large buxom obese queens"" or ""We need great golden copulations"" or ""To propagate our lust for life"" or ""Death and my cock are the world"" read bad, you should hear him recite them.

You can't deny these boys are pros--they know how to pace an album, hard ones and soft ones and golden oldies and rhinestone originals, and I still love their famous fat-skinny counterpoint on stage. But any group that can attach a line like ""Proud and gentle was the loving of the last two island swans"" to a great hard rock tune has got to be doing something wrong.

FALSE,C,Together,Anne Murray,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7489,"
Tom Smucker, who should know, says the difference between the departed Brian Ahern and Tom Catalano, the producer Murray has inherited from Helen Reddy, is the difference between Revisionist Anti Schlock and Assumed Schlock. If Schlock is ""materialism in a Dionysian mode""--innocent, like Las Vegas as Tom Wolfe explains it--then Assumed Schlock ""takes consumption for granted as consumption turns into smug middle-class accumulation."" In other words, all the Canadian songwriters in the world can't overcome the extravagant dullness of these arrangements: the rock 'n' roll cut could be Giselle MacKenzie in 1956. Say it ain't so, Annie.

FALSE,C,It Still Moves,My Morning Jacket,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12080,"
It's touching to watch the latest indie-rock generation flail around in search of a form, spouting sincerely all the while. But it's also depressing. Like the emo guys, Louisville's Neil-ish Jim James has the advantage of normal feelings and ambition--he's not content to remain subcultural. He claims his Dave Matthews-sponsored major-label debut was his chance to make a true band record, and I guess his boys are trickier than Crazy Horse, just not in any way you haven't heard before. Then there's his filtered drawl, his straitened tune sense, his lyrics you feel cheated straining for, his 12 songs in 72 minutes. For what? For the horrible Memphis Horns coda of ""Easy Morning Rebel,"" plodding on funklessly for two minutes after the vocal has gone the way of all reverb?

FALSE,C,Desertshore,Nico,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7521,"
The Velvet Underground and Nico plus Chelsea Girl convinced me that Nico had charisma; The Marble Index plus Desertshore convince me that she's a fool. The difference is that now Nico writes the songs--songs with titles like ""The Falconer"" and ""Abschied,"" songs that indulge her doleful monotone instead of playing rhythms and tempos against it. Nothing new here--bohemian hangers-on always get to publish their work while the less socially adept (""charismatic"") are shafted. John Cale, with his ""spare"" arrangements, plays patron.
"
FALSE,C,The End,Nico,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2577,"
I don't know vy she's moaning about unved virgins and vether to betray her hate, and I don't vant to know. The Manzanera-Eno-Cale settings, which I believe is what one calls this sort of elevated sound effect, are suitably morbid and exotic. But funereal irony aside, her parlay of the Doors' ""The End"" and the Fuehrer's ""Das Lied Der Deutschens"" contextualizes both tunes more pejoratively than is intended. Nico is what happens when the bloodless wager their minds on the wisdom of the blood and the suicidal make something of their lives. If this be romanticism, give me Matthew Arnold--and gimme shelter.

""I think maybe the next generation of clubbers will want to move out of the hip-hop, r&amp;b vibe--they'll want something a bit more,"" posits the Guinness World Record DJ (opened for U2, you know) as he predicts US dominion for his post-Balearic tranceport, which turns out to be textured Eurodisco BPMs sans diva mess. It's only a mix record (two mix records, why stint in utopia?), so how bad can it be? Start with four tracks featuring Dead Can Dance and/or Lisa Gerrard. And for that mass appeal--Blade Runner!

The self-serving, pseudopolitical pap Kenny Gamble sets his boys to declaiming here underlines the way the overripeness of this vocal and production style can go mushy, which it does. Even the working-class party anthem ""Livin' for the Weekend"" is ruined by the rest of the side--some play-her-like-a-violin soft-core, and the unspeakable (would it were unsingable) ""I Love Music."" Moral: the rich and the superrich shit--the nouveau riche can fuck you over too.

Gosh, how'd they think of that? Heavy is a mission with them, I guess. Glam too, you should see their costumes--Bowie does Star Trek, 1974. When it gets this silly it can be fun sometimes.

But even at their best they did sound forced. And their own contribution to the deterioration of AM radio was considerable.

This mainstream synthesis is not without a certain agreeable tension--vocally and instrumentally, these boys do have their licks down. But it's also a demonstration of how today's pop exploits the rhythmic and dramatic clichï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s of yesterday's black music.

FALSE,C,Worlds Away,Pablo Cruise,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5615,"
The Cruisers hit my enemies list somewhere on Interstate 95. Hook glut, it's called--hear David Jenkins sing ""once you get past the pain"" fifty times in a day and the pain will be permanent. Even if the next hit is the title cut, a genuine rocker, the band is the '70s Grass Roots, and if Orleans and the Doobie Brothers are the obvious forerunners, that's their cross to bear. It don't mean a thing if it's studio swing.

I might agree that the way this record approximates what it (supposedly) criticizes is a species of profundity if what it (supposedly) criticized was schlock. As it is, the pseudo-disco makes Giorgio Moroder sound like Eno and the pseudo-sci-fi makes Isaac Asimov seem like a deep thinker. Back to the control board.

FALSE,C,Heartbreaker,Dolly Parton,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5629,"
Her singular country treble is unsuited to rock, where little-girlishness works only as an occasional novelty. As a result, the rock part of her crossover move fails, relegating her to the mawkish pop banality that tempts almost every genius country singer.

The three live sides include no new tunes and none from his first album. Many women scream, and a few sing into his hand-held mike. Both uptempo tunes on the studio side are pretty good, but they're interspersed with an exceedingly distracting interview conducted by one Mimi Brown. MB: ""How do you like your eggs?"" TP: ""Hard.""

The head Journeyman's USA for Africa cameos were so discreetly intense and discreetly tossed off they made me wonder what I'd been missing. Now I know--musical gastroenteritis. Pat Boone didn't understand, so why should Steve Perry--oversinging signifies not soul and inspiration but will and desperation.

""One Slip,"" which provides the title at just the moment the singer is so ""decadent"" as to copulate with a woman, is no less sexist than the rape-fantasy cover of Roger Waters's Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking. ""The Dogs of War,"" ID'd with blues bottom, could almost be the tin soldiers of Waters-as-Floyd's The Final Cut. In short, you'd hardly know the group's conceptmaster was gone--except that they put out noticeably fewer ideas.

This is the famous Lennon/Clapton/Ono/Voorman/White (Voorman?/White?) concert. I happened to be there and it wasn't so hot live. It is worse recorded. The anti-Yoko reaction has long since passed beyond boorishness, but that doesn't mean I want to hear her keen for 20 minutes, and the rock side is raw and badly recorded, with Clapton's masterful lead obscured by Lennon's rhythm. Of value primarily as a document.

Unless ""A masterpiece without a frame"" and ""I want to fuck her on the floor/Among my books of ancient lore"" are jokes no one gets, the sole compliment one can pay this confessional poetry by a fiftysomething cocksman who Cannot Love is that at least he's willing to look like a fool. But that's been his shtick since he was bleeding himself with broken Skippy jars. Right, Ig, you're ""corrupt""--no news there. Unfortunately, blaming ""the paranoia of the age"" and bitching ""I gave em every part of me"" is also corrupt. Plus one more thing: Until you learn to sing a little better, maybe you'd better say goodbye to Medeski Martin and Wood and put in a call to the Sales brothers.

With its mawkish self-righteousness, the title epitomizes why we backsliders have permanent doubts about fundamentalist culture. As do the music's secular sellouts, overblown sanctimony, and simulated heavenly hosts--and the thought of RCA making money on two dead messiahs at once.

The first surprise is that the Glen Ballard AOR isn't worse. The second surprise is that she wrote the intense if clumsy lyrics herself.

Of course he's serious; who could doubt it? Griff's problem (one of them, I mean) is that he's too serious--Chuck D. is too serious, and Chuck is Kid if not Play by comparison. What little pleasure contaminates this music is like a Stryper solo, or a folksinger who's decided a drummer might bring his or her message to the masses--aping Chuck or biting the Last Poets, Griff's a lame, and the Lads are followers. Even the list of U.S. war crimes, the strongest dumbass leftist moment in a scattershot analysis, is compromised by his praise for Khomeini and Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings. And though he adjudges the universal price code a tool of the Great Satan, he didn't have the clout or the principle to keep it off his package.

Admired by Britcrits, who can't tell whether they're ""pop"" or ""rock,"" and their record company, which pushed (and shoved) this follow-up until it went gold Stateside, they try to prove ""Creep"" wasn't a one-shot by pretending that it wasn't a joke. Not that there's anything deeply phony about Thom Yorke's angst--it's just a social given, a mindset that comes as naturally to a '90s guy as the skilled guitar noises that frame it. Thus the words achieve precisely the same pitch of aesthetic necessity as the music, which is none at all.

FALSE,C,A Better Version of Me,Rainer Maria,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10068,"
Structurally, indie-rock is as healthy as any other unsubsidized commodity in a panic economy. Clubs will fail, arty fans feel the pinch, but the infrastructure won't blow away. Musically, however, it's just limping along, especially when it declines the crutch of genre homage. Take this high-buzz Wisconsin-to-Gotham brainchild of ex-Ezra Pound guitarist William Kuehn. Compared by one admirer to ""pop bands like Versus, Verbena, and of course Superchunk"" while another cites its ""male/female vocals a la Velocity Girl (minus the pop)"" (and neither mentions Veruca Salt or Vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rttinï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½), Rainer Maria is the genuine collegiate article: impressionistic and overwrought.

Like Birtha, this is a heavy group with female lead guitarist. Lester Bangs, holding forth as a connoisseur of schlock-rock, thinks this is great and Birtha is horrible. I think this is less horrible, that's all. Still the same strained, stupid lyrics with singing to match and programmed high energy to help it all go down (or past).

This special-price two-record set has excited reviewers, all of whom get off on the group's ethnicity--Redbone (said to be a Cajun word for half-breed) comprises four honest-to-Gawd Injuns! But can a red man sing the whites? Sorry, not this time. After all, what in Native American tradition would predispose a band toward rock and roll? Much more impressive is that Pat and Lolly Vegas wrote ""Niki Hokey,"" but except maybe for ""Witch Queen of New Orleans,"" there are no more of these here. Better you should send your five bucks to the Piutes.

Which of course she did. Item: California disc jockeys are playing Bette's version of ""Delta Dawn"" on top of Helen's and chortling.

When I heard that a bunch of Marxist-Leninists from Cambridge had made a satirical rock and roll record, I couldn't wait to hear it, but believe me, you can. Only Marxist-Leninists from Cambridge would spend so much time mocking elitist academics while their own distance from working-class experience, typified by the lack of conviction in their folk-rock, remained so palpable.

I read where this song cycle about two drug addicts who fall into sadie-mazie in thrillingly decadent Berlin is a . . . what was that? artistic accomplishment, even if you don't like it much. Well, the category is real enough--it describes a lot of Ornette Coleman and even some Randy Newman, not to mention a whole lot of books--but in this case it happens to be horseshit. The story is lousy--if something similar was coughed up by some avant-garde asshole like, oh, Alfred Chester (arcane reference for all you rock folk who think you're cool cos you read half of Nova Express) everyone would be too bored to puke at it. The music is only competent--even Bob Ezrin can't manufacture a distance between the washed-up characters and their washed-out creator when the creator is actually singing. Also, what is this water-boy business? Is that a Buddhist cop? Gunga Din? Will Lou lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it?

It's disheartening that people whose age and wisdom approach my own are fussing over his New Orleans ""concept""--a posse of L.A. studio hacks augmented by a few ringers and the kind of second-line once-removed horn charts the Band was hiring 20 years ago.

The ryffs keep the treadmyll moving with nary a twytch, not once does a lyric offer a detail of behavior or decor, or even a real metaphor--the sexist twaddle of Nyck Gylder's ""stereo jungle child"" in the title chartbuster, now transmogrified into lyberated twaddle because a woman is singing, is as hot as it gets.

FALSE,C,The Four of Us,John Sebastian,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7756,"
Sebastian makes the mistake of beginning this with two great blues, after which his own funk and mawk sound lifeless. This is unfair. They're really only feckless--or careless, like his love. The title suite (or whatever it is) is the tie-dyed mind at its sloppiest.

Cute, right. Not offensive like Michael Bolton or Celine Dion, of course. But also a lot less fun than his buddy Gloria Estefan. In fact, the most unlistenable recent exponent of the ""soul""-inflected American variant on the international pop ballad style. Just in case you're keeping track.

Why do I suspect that only a whiner foolish enough to fall for the depressed wacko now suffocating him all over the airwaves would be stupid enough to blame it on her? Because no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of guys who program the drums but consider it tasteful to hire out the strings to certified human beings. However desperate the biz may be for matinee idols, anybody who figures this neosensitive can fill Bryan Adams's shoes would have bet on Robbie Nevil back when these things mattered.

FALSE,C,Hotcakes,Carly Simon,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7782,"
""You're So Vain"" left a nice afterglow--as Ellen Willis says, it proves that rock and roll is so democratic that even a rich person can make a great single. But except for the startling ""Mockingbird"" (buy the forty-five if you must) the album's most interesting moment occurs when Simon whistles. Need I add that her whistling is flat musically and epistemologically?

FALSE,C,Duets,Frank Sinatra,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5896,"
He creaks, he cracks, he croaks, he clinks, yet that's not quite the point--older guys with worse voices have sung better anyway. Champion Jack Dupree, for instance, prevailed in his eighties because he never staked his manhood on the technical impeccability of his physical instrument. For decades, Sinatra's sound was magnificent--not just beautiful, meaningful. But now, though he still outclasses the likes of Bono and Carly Simon, Liza Minnelli takes him to acting school and Luther Vandross sings pretty rings around him. He who lives by the larynx shall die by the larynx.

FALSE,C,Return of Dragon,Sisqo,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10328,"
The little man had a big hit. His solo debut went quadruple platinum, making him the quota-pumping toast of many media. But he wanted more than fame and fortune. He wanted the Grammy snobs denied ""Thong Song."" So his follow-up crossed PG-13 thug and subpar Luther Vandross. Certified platinum shortly after its June release, it was off the charts by September. Let's hope we all last until 2004. It would be truly terrible if militant Islam were to deny us our Dru Hill reunion.

She sounds like herself on several cuts and Bette Midler on one, but she also sounds tired, and for the most part this is as inflated as the worst Airplane.

You may not think Glenn Branca's proteges are a rock and roll band, but after all, why else would they essay a lyric like ""Fucking youth/Working youth""? At their worst they sound like Polyrock mainlining metronome, at their best like one of Branca's early drafts. The best never last long enough. Not for nothing is the sonic grown-up so attached to phony grandeur.

I welcome this group just because it existed--there ought to be a hundred warm, competent, eclectic bands putting ten rock and roll songs on albums, but there probably aren't more than twenty. Later, however, I re-examined the warm, competent songs in question and noticed that the two good ones were by Johnny Cash and Hank Williams. So say eclecticism with certain, er, tendencies, and rest assured that not a one of the guys plays pedal steel.

The title is heavy-metal logic, illustrated with a Klaus Voorman cartoon depicting a henpecking dominatrix. The songs, mostly by returned prodigal Gary Wright, depict the perils of egotism. The connection is more heavy-metal logic.

FALSE,C,Real to Reel,Starcastle,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7858,"
Given the fluttering keyboards, weedy vocals, and fantasy-fiction medievalism favored by these Midwestern up-and-comers, you'd figure this was just round four of dips to disc, but it's worse than that. That title means something; in the great tradition of heartland eclecticism (or is it rootlessness?) (not exploitation, surely?) they're adding power-rock and pop-melody moves to the art-rock casserole. With hooks, yet. Lord save us.

I played this in the spirit of one more once, just in case I'd missed something--for instance, the Joe Walsh-produced Old Wave, released 1983 Canada-only, how sad. But whatever his charms as an ex-Beatle, he's been El Lay for most of his adult life, and even on rock and roll ditties drummed up by ex-Beatles George Harrison and Paul McCartney (not exactly surefire hitmakers, I know, though John Lennon's isn't much better), his dogged directness can't cut it. Better than Telly Savalas, but no match for George Harrison, or Joe Walsh.

Despite the presence of some good and previously unreleased songs, this is an indulgence. It includes the 19-minute version of ""The Pusher,"" which must have been a mind-blower in 1966 but ain't no more. John Kay and the Sparrow (Columbia CS 9758) features essentially the same personnel and is better. My copy was scratchy, by the way.

FALSE,C,Catch Bull at Four,Cat Stevens,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7879,"
Reading the lyric of ""The Boy With the Moon and Star on His Head,"" I was impressed by how unpretentiously it simulated early English poetry. But when I listened--a widely recommended method for that perception of songs--I noticed affectations like ""the naked earth beneath us and the universe above,"" and winced at the next-to-last couplet, which ends with a weak word for the sake of a weak rhyme. Then I browsed in Norman Ault's anthology of Elizabethan lyrics. Forget it, Cat.

FALSE,C,Out of Order,Rod Stewart,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8445,"
You know what ""Produced by Rod Stewart, Andy Taylor &amp; Bernard Edwards"" means? It means he's elected to replace Robert Palmer in Power Station. And you know why Jim Cregan, David Lindley, and Lenny Pickett are on the record? Because he didn't have the guts to go all the way.

FALSE,C,Stephen Stills 2,Stephen Stills,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7899,"
Stills has always come on as the ultimate rich hippie--arrogant, self-pitying, sexist, shallow. Unfortunately, he's never quite fulfilled this artistic potential, but now he's approaching his true level. Flashes of brilliant ease remain--the single, ""Marianne,"" is very nice, especially if you don't listen too hard to the lyrics--but there's also a lot of stuff on order of an all-male chorus with jazzy horns singing ""It's disgusting"" in perfect tuneful unison, and straight, I swear. Keep it up, SS--it'll be a pleasure to watch you fail.

These guys combine the sensitivity and erudition of ? and the Mysterians with the street smarts of the Doors and detest the act of love with a humorless intensity worthy of Anthony Comstock. You can tell by the way they discreetly bring up subjects like musicianship and education in interviews that, just as they claim, they don't belong to anybody's new wave. Too dumb.

FALSE,C,The Broadway Album,Barbra Streisand,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8453,"
I had hopes for this record, honest. I certainly prefer the show tunes of her flowering to the ""rock"" (and schlock) of her Hollywood phase, and I enjoy discovering musical-comedy gems my normal interests would never steer me to. But unearthing gems is not Barbra's purpose. There are only three lyricists here--Ira Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein II, and the album's real reason for being, Stephen Sondheim, who sums up his aesthetic philosophy by rewriting a song about Seurat so it applies instead to that other great artiste, la Streisand. I've enjoyed all the non-Sondheim songs in less precisely wrought versions and am also familiar with a little something called ""Send in the Clowns."" I admire the cattiness of ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" The others I'll live the rest of my life without.

FALSE,C,Earthquake Weather,Joe Strummer,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5949,"
A man without a context, Joe digs into Americana up to his elbows, up to bebop, up to Marvin Gaye, cramming obsessions and casual interests into songs as wordy and pointless as Ellen Foley's. Foley's absence is a relief, but with Joe emulating Gaye and Bird--crooning and murmuring instead of screaming and spitting, cramming in the syllables--not that much of a relief. New guitar sidekick Zander Schloss does what he can to make things worse.

FALSE,C,Heavy,The Stylistics,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7923,"
These guys are going to miss Thom Bell, who unlike Hugo &amp; Luigi knows how to shape songs for Russell Thompkins's falsetto and unlike Van McCoy knows the difference between strings and tomato soup. At least this album provides its own hit cut, instead of rereleasing an old Bell ringer--""Heavy Fallin' Out"" is an impressive if flukish bit of upbeat production.

When a studio creation does her greatest hits on stage, she diminishes them (arrangements worthy of the Supremes at the Copa, which is more than I can say for ""My Man Medley""), and when her more is ""Mac Arthur Park Suite,"" she makes you remember what less is supposed to be (I much prefer Andy Kaufman's interpretation).

FALSE,C,Donna Summer,Donna Summer,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8459,"
Turkeys this humongous will soon go the way of the dodo, and for the same excellent reason--they defy all aerodynamic principles. Misshapen and useless despite a not-bad hit single and a not-bad Springsteen song, it's an object lesson in record-biz malfeasance from the Horatio Alger lies of ""Livin' in America"" to the lumpish desecration of ""Lush Life,"" and Summer thanks God so often it's surprising she couldn't talk Him into joining Dyan Cannon, Kenny Loggins, Stevie Wonder, and Peggy Lipton Jones in the All Star Choir that chants this Inspirational Verse from Jon Anderson and Vangelis: ""Shablamidi, shablamida/Shablamidi/Shablamidi, shablamida.""

Last year Swan made the finest rockabilly album of the current revival, songful and manic and ebulliently inadequate, and it didn't sell shit.

For everybody's sake, let's hope this doesn't sell shit either.

""Teenage News"" has been a great one ever since Syl introduced it with the Dolls. ""What's That Got to Do With Rock 'n Roll?"" is a pretty good one.

As egotists go, Taylor is a talent--a gifted guitarist, a better-than-average melodist, a pithy lyricist whose feeling for Americanese is warm if corny. And his voice you can get used to--it's soulful in its way, and he can phrase. But melodies aside, he's not a star for his virtues. He's a star because he's an egotist--because he vaunts his sensitivity so expertly. So it's inevitable that this best-of should shortchange his sense of humor (""Gorilla,"" ""Chili Dog,"" ""Money Machine"") and horror (""Knocking 'Round the Zoo,"" ""Junkie's Lament"") and preserve his disgraceful covers of ""You've Got a Friend"" and ""How Sweet It Is.""

Their worst-ever studio LP doesn't deserve to be called slick. It's professional and expensive, yes, but it's also a mess--oversung, overarranged, overpackaged.

It's easy out there for an Oscar winner, but you'd never know it from these entertainment moguls, who pretend or report that they're still investing in mayhem, misogyny and sales careers whose main drawback is that they can get you arrested. Case in point: Dat Dumbass Project Pat, who with three years in the pen behind him adds extra soupcons of brutality just in case Hollywood has turned Juicy J soft. Watch out, little brother.

Blame Canada, which gulls citizens into subsidizing local culture with the lure of universal health care. Fifteen years on, that northern nation's favorite rock band--led by deep thinker Gordon Downie, who ungratefully notes, ""If I do believe in a country, it's the country of me""--has progressed from a passable ""blues-based"" literacy (imbued, of course, with the natural sense of rhythm for which Canadians are renowned) to candidly ornate and obscure art-rock. ""Why haven't The Hip sold millions in the States?"" demands one loyal fan. His first hypothesis: ""Lyrics don't translate into ebonics.""

The only way to make their record more depressing would be to add a hologram of Gordon's replacement, Tommy Frenzy, whose slick blond hair and metal teeth now set the band's android-delinquent ""image."" Then again, you could take away Jeff Salen's guitar.

Elevated by the Rolling Stones into mythic status among white people, the Turners are now haunted by their profligate recording habits--Capitol is the tenth label to release an I&amp;TT LP in the past two years. Granted, most and maybe all of them are better than this, a humdrum blues runthrough (with big-band horns and fake-symph strings) on which Ike claims authorship of such works as ""Dust My Broom"" (here yclept ""I Believe"") and ""Ten Long Years"" (here yclept ""Five Long Years""). Apparently it was cut some years ago for Cenco (?) Records. The Turners are currently contracted to Liberty, have authorized product out on A&amp;M and Blue Thumb, and caveat emptor.

FALSE,C,As Nasty as They Wanna Be,The 2 Live Crew,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5813,"
The ACLU may not want it advertised, but this record is pornographic; that's one of the few good things about it. Hooked by two Hispanic/Asian working girls uttering rhythmic fuckwords, the number-one rap single ""Me So Horny"" packs the gross eroticism of a good hard-core loop. Romance isn't an issue; liking women isn't even an issue. Thus there are few distracting rationalizations about how this or that bitch did them wrong--these Miami knuckleheads are just normal red-blooded American misogynists. They like it ""rough and painful""; they tell men how to ""give her more than she wants""; they never touch a woman anywhere but between her legs. And only rarely do their raw samples generate the heat of the single. So in the long run, they're almost as unlikely to inspire good sex as a sermon by Donald Wildmon. They don't belong in jail. But remember John Holmes: he who lives by the dick shall die by the dick.

First they wanted to be machines, now they want to have roots--it's new, it's different.

You read it here first: the scattered actual ""pop"" songs on this 11-cut album--the one about eating pussy is the most enthusiastic--tend to break down into long, repetitive, self-consciously inept codas, which blend in the mind's ear with the scattered instrumentals per se. It would be wrong to call such passages drones, because drones propel, and propulsion would be catering to the hoi polloi--""patterns"" is quite kind enough. Cool people whose hobby is inept bands seem to think these whatchamacallems apotheosize self-consciously amateurish charm. If you're among them, call me when you get a life.

Indeed, the Chicago mafia may believe I'm no judge of their metal/AOR, either. But bohemian one-upsmanship I know, and these guys are so deep in hype Maurice Starr is lucky they're too old to be new kids.

Not that they give a shit, but trading Dave for Sammy sure wrecked their shot at Led Zep of the '80s--master guitarist, signature vocalist, underrated rhythm section. They wouldn't have made it anyway, of course. Eddie's obsessed with technique, Roth's contemptuous of technique, rhythm section's got enough technique and no klutz genius. But Sammy . . . like wow. If I can't claim the new boy owns them (property rights they protect), you can't deny he defines them. Not that they give a shit.

Although bands like this still offend idealists, you can't call them pseudoalternative anymore, because they don't bother pretending. They're just rockers who crash the album chart, where the money is, from the singles chart, where they're supposedly no longer welcome--in other words, pop bands who can play their axes. There's San Francisco's gold-certified Third Eye Blind, whose little sex kinks are too catchy to get het up about. There's Orlando's double-platinum Matchbox 20, whose breakthrough hit some mistakenly (as is always claimed) believe promotes spousal abuse. But the one I really can't stand is this near-pseudoalternative one, grown men from Michigan who released two indie albums before their major-label debut catapulted to platinum on a soggy prowoman morality tale aimed at frat rats, who are urged not to drive girls to suicide by dumping them. When Brian Vander Ark finally emotes the chorus, it's like, I dunno, grunge lives.

I know you don't think he's good for anything but excess anyway, but if you'll allow me to get technical for a moment, there's good Barry White and bad Barry White. all the good Barry White any normal person needs is on his 1975 Greatest Hits for 20th Century, which this CBS-distributed two-disc compilation had better not displace in the racks. White's half begins with ""I Love to Sing the Songs I Sing,"" its cannily repeated verb an excellent definition of bad Barry White, and ends with ""Just the Way You Are,"" which he, well, sings. There's also a side of Love Unlimited that leaves their only good album untouched. And a side of the Love Unlimited Orchestra, Barry's Jackie Gleason tribute band.

Tommy's operatic pretensions were so transparent that for years it seemed safe to guess that Townshend's musical ideas would never catch up with his lyrics. And it fact they didn't--both became more prolix at about the same rate. This isn't so grotesque as All the Blind Chinamen Have Western Eyes, but between the synths and the book-club poetry it's the nearest thing to classic awful English art-rock since Genesis discovered funk. Best tune: ""Eminence Front,"" on which Townshend discovers funk. Just in time. Bye.

The album is unlistenable for a simple reason: Roger Daltrey. Now 62, he's incapable in body as well as mind of negotiating the first new Who material since 1982's dreadful It's Hard. Gesturing futilely toward high notes as he tries to remember his acting lessons, he croaks, growls, shouts, emotes and otherwise bollockses songs he's sure are profound. When the leader spells him seven tracks in, the sharp uptick in modesty and lyricism comes as a relief until the ""Wake up and hear the music"" jag at the end. But it's the leader who decided prog was a peachy idea, the leader who designates yet another song cycle a ""mini-opera,"" the leader who gives the orders around here. So the album is also unlistenable for a complicated reason: Pete Townshend.

This is regarded by the pure of heart as a racist vulgarization, but although I'll go along with the argument that the hook on ""Play That Funky Music"" isn't the rhythmic track but the words ""white boy,"" I insist that it's real hard to vulgarize Graham Central Station. Sure the performance is a bit on the crude side, but the relationship is more that of Grand Funk to Cream than of, say, Jim Dandy Mangrum to Sly Stone.

Since ""To Love Somebody"" isn't exactly Hank's kind of song, I guess he disavowed the Ray Ruff-produced side of this. On the other hand, ""Family Tradition"" (guess who that's about) leads off the other side, and it is exactly Hank's kind of song. Exactly. That's not so great either.

Having survived his brush with death, his defection to rock, and his obsession with his daddy, whom he now outsells, Williams rests on his laurels as professional braggart and secondhand showbiz legend. He's one of the few country artists who goes gold at least partly because he's not really country--like rock both '50s and post-Allmans, country's just grist for a macho vaudeville that on this album blows even harder than usual. The tip-off's ""Bocephus,"" a return to unabashed me-me-me. But let us now overlook the ill-rhymed polka about cowboy hats, the Leon Redbone-styled ""Harvest Moon,"" and the novelty rag about pretty girls whose ""pig"" friends interfere with the workings of Junior's dick.

Auteur-fuehrer-rapper Bob Rosenberg's unprecedented meld of disco cheese and heavy pop-rock proves yet again that originality and fatuity aren't mutually exclusive--especially if you don't take originality too far. Of the 10 songs here, Rosenberg wrote eight. These do not include (10cc's) ""I'm Not in Love,"" the highly belated follow-up to his 1988 Skynyrd-Frampton medley, nor ""Boogie Nights,"" to which he adds the moving if redundant confession, ""It took some remakes to get your attention."" They do, however, include the six-minute spoken-word-cheesy-pop-heavy-disco-rock ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" a political manifesto as daring and thoughtful as anything dreamed by Jello Bangladesh or Minions of Dull Chords. Quoting Jefferson, Whitman, Emerson, Wilde, his man Nietzsche, Solzhenitsyn, and the National Rifle Association, Rosenberg declares free speech useless and sweet reason all, while coming out in favor of animal rights, the Second Amendment, and robbing the rich--an exemplary melange of the one-stop individualism that's long passed for politics in every wing of the rock counterculture. Words to live by: ""Death before dishonor, as it were.""

Wilson's genius has never been as indelible or universal as worshipers believe. Generating illusions of eternal sunlight or crafting frames for crackpot solipsism, he was magical; stripped by Don Was or cambered by Van Dyke Parks, he was at least interesting. Submitting to adult-contempo tycoon Joe Thomas, however, he's just what you'd fear: a middle-aged pop pro who's proud he's no longer nuts and knows even less about the world than when he was. The lead cut has a happy tune, the dark finale some dysfunctional intimations. In between, he makes too much of attendant hacks and gestures at old glories from a failing high end.

Genealogically, Chynna's group--the elaborately arranged professional folk-rock of her mama and papa, rather than the obsessively reworked private surf-rock of Carnie and Wendy's boyish dad, are where their (and the world's) polished pop comes from, and their fashion sense is Laurel Canyon a land-grab later. Finicky and well-manicured though it is, it's not without its intricately minor pleasures, notably on compositions untouched by the singers' hands--""Impulsive,"" or (Gunnar and Matthew, why didn't you think of this?) ""Eyes Like Twins."" The '60s myth ""The Dream Is Still Alive"" they claim as their own.

As a sourpuss who counsels self-improvement and jots down the occasional specific, Karl Wallinger is several steps up the evolutionary ladder from Howard Jones. But it's no less fatalistic to say humanity is defined by original sin than to say the world is good because God made it. Jones believes that war is over if you think it is, Wallinger that war is over if each and every one of you think it is; both prefer attitude to action, especially collective action.
