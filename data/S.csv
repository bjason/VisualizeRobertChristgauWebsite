Many second-level pop stars have looked dumber agonizing over their own success than Kele Okereke. But however obsessed he may be with the celebrity fleshpots he frequents so unhappily on the lead cut, they remain a cliche to which he adds nothing, including a decent tune. Elsewhere he bemoans his inability to love, and so it goes. Okereke is singing with size and emotion, and producer Jacknife Lee noises things up nicely. But Bloc Party's beaty songcraft was never as intrinsically attractive as their multiracial image, and though the new bunch are sharply executed, they cry out for killer choruses now that they're not just outcries of generational frustration. The terrorist paranoia meditation ""Hunting for Witches"" is brought home by such a chorus, as is the strung-out ""Sunday."" But too often Okereke relies on his celebrity and production budget to make us listen. He should ask Brandon Flowers--this doesn't work.

FALSE,S,Schizophrenic,J.C. Chasez,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12291,"
None of Justin Timberlake's slyly seductive charm for this diva with balls--he's on the hunt for some serious pus-say. Eight of the first 10 tracks are sex-obsessed, with three promising to ""love you all night strong."" Only guys who entertain too many females in hotel rooms or spend too much time at worldsex.com believe this is what ladies long to hear. Just when you think Chasez will never get his head out of his ass, however, you find out why it's called Schizophrenic. For the final five tracks, the 'N Sync grad is convincingly sweet, pretty, and needy, notably in the most famous words he'll ever write: ""'Cause when I'm all alone/I lie awake and masturbate/I love to hear the sounds you make/Baby here I come."" This ain't Timbaland or the Neptunes--the musical highlight is a Basement Jaxx track hooked by what sounds like an electric tympani. But the electronic dance-rock gets the pop job done. If it won't lure the average hottie into bed, it also won't make her reach for the remote or drive her off the dancefloor.

This well-selected, rarity-studded phantasmagoria of great hits, alternate takes, soundtrack oddities, previously unreleaseds, demos, and remixes traces an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived, but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before, only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo. Until his fourth solo album as an adult, Dangerous, Jackson's immense originality, adaptability, and ambition generate genius beats, hooks, arrangements, and vocals (though not lyrics). This is no less true of 1970's ""ABC"" than of 1979's ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" or 1991's ""Black and White."" While inventing sounds never heard before, Jackson changes with the times, from top 40 to disco to studio funk to new jack swing. This wondrous stuff will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and that's the end of it. But as his troubling life gets away from him in the '90s, so does his music. The fourth disc wisely downplays his intermittent belief that the next step in his progress was Celine Dion, and two tracks from 2001's underrated Invincible prove that he hasn't lost his unnatural sense of rhythm. But theme statements like R. Kelly's endless ""You Are Not Alone"" and Free Willy 2's regrettable ""Childhood"" are quietly yucky, and the four new songs are bland, forced, or both. The big finale opposes war.""Shake a Body,"" ""Monkey Business,"" ""Sunset Drive""

This album marks the moments when pop's longest running alleged felon came to release more music after being hit with child pornography charges in 2002 than he did in a decade-plus of untroubled r&amp;b thuggery. Pre-indictment, Kelly's m.o. was to undercut much ""Bump 'n' Grind"" with a little ""I Believe I Can Fly,"" but now he's added a new trick--not confessions, though the term is tempting, but dramatic pieces like the ridiculously mesmerizing ""Trapped in the Closet."" This album piles on the bump 'n' grind, from a title track in which Kelly and Snoop share two freaks apiece to the ""sexasauras,"" kangaroos, and jungle noises of the ridiculously sublime ""The Zoo."" But the standout tracks are a dialogue in a prison visiting room, a duet where he and Usher figure out they're both in love with the same Georgia Tech grad, and the escalating rage of a break-up phone call. ""Real Talk,"" that one's called--which sure beats sexual exploitation as an artistic specialty.

The legend of Little Richard, which in a just universe would prove eternal, is based entirely on the sides he cut with Bumps Blackwell for Specialty between September, 1955 and January, 1957. This was pure rock and roll: lewd, feral, prophetically fast, prophetically funky, and beset by the identity confusion of a man who never did figure out whether he was gay. All that's accomplished by his other recordings is to demonstrate that his power howl and crazed piano triplets are equal to but not ideal for gospel, kiddie novelties, whatever's asked--on these mid-'60s sessions, the soul-r&amp;b cusp. Their sole revelation: four previously unreleased tracks produced in London by Norman Hurricane Smith, at least three of which could sneak onto the Specialty box pure rock and rollers treasure. It's a worthy addition to Richard Penniman's oeuvre--but not to the legend. [<a href=""/xg/cdrev/lrichard.php"">Blender: 3</a>]<br/>""Get Down With It,"" ""Rocking Chair""

Billed as a song cycle about a Chicano's epic journey from Mexican valley to neon metropolis--something like that--the East L.A. Grammy winners' 10th studio album may suit old fans but won't convert any new ones. Slightly stolid even at their best, these veteran roots-rockers have never been slower--they sound tired, depressed. There's subtlety aplenty in the singing and especially the guitar, for which credit both player David Hidalgo and mixer Tchad Blake. But unless you count the cumbia, not one song rocks out. And apart from the laid-back ""Free Up,"" where the subtlety renders an apparent throwaway seductive with time, not one stands out either. [unknown]<br/>""Free Up""

Mixing humorously observed originals with carols roasted on an open fire and obscurities dug out of the piano bench, these five EPs, four originally intended as gifts for fans and friends, achieve a shade of pretty just right for a secular holiday with special meaning for adults who grew up associating ""The First Noel"" with presents. From an early ""Amazing Grace"" to a new ""Holy, Holy, Holy,"" Stevens's fragile banjo-and-tenor caroling is lovely, and several of his own songs belong in the Xmas canon, notably one called ""Come On! Let's Boogey to the Elf Dance"": ""Your sister's bangs, she cut them herself"" is a December surprise many will recognize. It's just too bad alt-rock's favorite Christian couldn't resist the sin of completism. Piled atop one another, the less inspired tracks remind us how very much nicer it is to get the one perfect gift you never dreamed of than a lot of crap you don't need.

Joe Strummer mellowed brilliantly in life. He raised three kids, avoiding pimping himself, kept his ideals while modulating his anger. But he never focused that brilliance artistically, probably because focus wasn't his thing--the two-minute intensity of The Clash was an aberration. The Mescaleros' world-music wanderings proceed directly from 1981's Sandinista! and are best joined on 2001's Global a Go Go. This follow-up was largely complete when Strummer died in 2002, only without vocals on two reportedly rousing songs that are therefore omitted--and also, oddly, without much international color or guest flourish. Strummer is probably telling Bob Marley about its folk-rock skank right now. But there's small chance Marley will return the favor of his ""Redemption Song"" cover even for ""Coma Girl,"" a lament for a lost youth culture Bob's grateful he never had to describe.
