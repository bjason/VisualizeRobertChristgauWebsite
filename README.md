### Introduction
This visualization visualized over Robert's over 16,000 graded reviews and presented the distribution of the album reviews to the years and to the grade letter. In the reviews, he graded an album among A+, A, A-, B+, \*\*\*, \*\*, \*, S, N, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, E+, E, E-, X. A+ is the highest grade meaning "this is a record of sustained beauty, power, insight, groove, and/or googlefritz that has invited and repaid repeated listenings in the daily life of someone with 500 other CDs to get to" and E- is, of course, the opposite. The specific grading critiria can be found here. 

There is 3 graph and 1 list.

1. Grade graph. Grade view shows the distribution to the grade, that is, what is the proportion of certain grade Christgau ever gave. You can scroll on this graph to rotate the pie graph to get better view of one certain grade. Besides, hover over one grade to have detail statistic of this grade.
