FALSE,D-,Love Will Keep Us Together,The Captain and Tennille,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6541,"
One expected a lousy album, but not this lousy. Their good sense in appropriating Neil Sedaka's unused hit arrangement was a one-shot: the rest of the time they spread the middle of the road so thin they make ""Rainy Days and Mondays"" sound like ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting."" Admirers of the single should invest in a copy of Sedaka's Back.

FALSE,D-,Clear Light,Clear Light,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10986,"
You want godawful, these guys'll give you godawful. I mean, they can do it all--self-pitying wimp harmonies, blooze-based bombast, stupid poetry, complaints that the organ-grinder's monkey has strangled on his chain, and a keyboard player who will eventually back James Taylor. Low point: six minutes plus of Tom Paxton's ""Mr. Blue,"" alternately declaimed over funereal drums and speeded up to your basic Doors tempo. Oh wow.

FALSE,D-,If I Could Only Remember My Name,David Crosby,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6654,"
This disgraceful performance inspires the first Consumer Guide Competition. The test: Rename David Crosby (he won't know the difference). The prize: One Byrds LP of your choice (he ought to know the difference). The catch: You have to beat my entries. Which are: Rocky Muzak, Roger Crosby, Vaughan Monroe.

FALSE,D-,A Day Without Rain,Enya,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10332,"
Pondering the fate of post-September 11 pop, everyone predicted what they already wished for--Slipknot undone, Britney in hiding. What happened instead was the unthinkable--sales of Enya's first album since 1995 spiked 10 months after release. (And she thought that movie where Charlize Theron fucked Keanu Reeves and died of cancer was a promotional coup!) Two years in the making with the artiste playing every synthesizer, the 11 songs here last a resounding 34 minutes and represent a significant downsizing of her New Age exoticism since 1988's breakthrough, Watermark--it's goopier, more simplistic. Yanni is Tchaikovsky by comparison, Sarah McLachlan Ella Fitzgerald, treacle Smithfield ham. Right, whatever gets folks through the night. But Enya's the kind of artist who makes you think, if this piffle got them through it, how dark could their night have been? Like Master P or Michael Bolton only worse, she tests one's faith in democracy itself.

Jerry Wexler and Atlantic, who would seem to know more about this sort of thing than I do, are pushing this refugee from the production booth as the Man Who Will Revitalize Soul Music. Could be, as I say, but if having soul means digging on all this supper-club melodrama and homogenized jazz then I'm content to be sterile, square, and white. Yeah yeah yeah.
"
FALSE,D-,MTV Unplugged 2.0,Lauryn Hill,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11796,"
Probably not the worst album ever released by an artist of substance--there are all those Elvis soundtracks. But in the running. Full-length double-CD of wordy strophic strolls that often last six, seven, eight minutes, accompanied solely by a solo guitar Hill can barely strum (the first finger-picked figure occurs on track 10, where it repeats dozens upon dozens of times, arghh). Unlike Hill herself, who during one of many spoken-word breaks tells the adoring multitude that her singing voice has been roughed up by a late night (but not how weak it is when she gets her eight hours), the melodies do not assert themselves. Inspirational Patter: ""Every single one of these songs is about me first."" Makes them realer, aight?
"
FALSE,D-,Mama Lion,Mama Lion,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7332,"
Lynn Carey, who fronts this outfit, makes speed-screamers like Lydia Pense sound like the demi-Janises they wish they could be. Together with her producer, her bassist, and her guitarist, she has written the first rock song I've heard about sex between woman, but if Lynn really dug her sisters so much she'd hire some female musicians. It would help. Continual intensity is supposed to communicate passion, but this doesn't even convey lust, except for something boring, like success.
"
FALSE,D-,Songs for a Friend,Jon Mark,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7353,"
In which jazz-rock (what? you don't remember Mark-Almond, the supergroup?) expresses its deepest yearnings. The inner sleeve lists the names of forty-one string players and eleven businessmen, but the first side ends with the singer threatening to quit on his boss, a Mr. Rosenfeld. Mark's business manager is named Michael Rosenfeld. Subtitle: ""Bird With a Broken Wing Suite.""

FALSE,D-,Double Take,The Mark & Clark Band,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11316,"
Twin brothers who play twin grand pianos, among the five highest-paid unrecorded acts in America after doing three shows a night in Fort Lauderdale for four years, the Seymours have finally agreed to take Ferrante &amp; Teicher to the rock and roll masses. Insprational Verse: ""A world without feelings, they're just cold corporate dealings/You beg, you borrow, and you steal/There is nothing real.""
"
FALSE,D-,Dear Folks Sorry I Haven't Written Lately,Roger Miller,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11438,"
I mourned Miller's writing block actively; now I wish it would come back. He's turned into one more Nashville sentimentalist. Example: This album transforms ""My Uncle Used to Love Me But She Died"" into ""My Mother Used to Love Me But She Died"" and adds superfluous soulettes.
"
FALSE,D-,On the Threshold of a Dream,The Moody Blues,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11535,"
Rod McKuen out of Ray Conniff with assists by Hugo Montenegro and Bob Crewe. Ugh.

FALSE,D-,Passage,Passage,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5597,"
Though I wish he wouldn't dedicate this venture (or his life) to ""Our Savior, Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth,"" that's not why (Brother) Louis Johnson pisses me off (cf. Al Green, Maria Muldaur). He pisses me off because he's as sterile and chickenshit as the polite elevator funk he uses to sell his message--too chickenshit to mention, for instance, that he believes ""Mr. Jewish Man"" and ""Mr. Muslim Man"" are doomed to burn in hellfire. Heed my advice, people. When somebody tells you to ""say good-bye to the reasoning/That's standing in your way,"" think some more. And when somebody tells you that without Jesus ""you can't be livin',"" take a deep breath.

FALSE,D-,Coup D'Etat,Plasmatics,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5693,"
Now that they've copped to heavy metal tempos, they could last as long as Judas Priest, although since the HM hordes do demand chops, Wendy O. might be well advised to try singing with her nether lips. Not only can't she carry a tune (ha), she can't even yell. Inspirational Thing She Says Backward on Outgroove: ""The brainwashed do not know they are brainwashed."" Inspirational Message Scratched on Outgroove: ""You were not made for this.""

FALSE,D-,Scarlet Rivera,Scarlet Rivera,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7640,"
Those who call this the worst record of the year (I've met two) must only listen to sidepeople's albums when the sidepeople are Dylan's (or ""his,"" as the notes here would have it.) In fact, many sidepeople stretch out one or two acceptable melodies and some should-be rejects into an instrumental LP. Although come to think of it most of them come up with eight cuts, not six. And most of them can improvise some. Hmm.
"
FALSE,D-,Unborn Child,Seals and Crofts,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7753,"
This may be catchy but I refuse to get caught; they may be good at what they do, but what they do is so disgusting that that only makes it worse. I would tell them to find their roots, but instead of regrouping as the Champs, they'd probably convince Warner Bros. to waste more vinyl on the Anita Kerr Singers.
"
FALSE,D-,Cybill Does It . . . to Cole Porter,Cybill Shepherd,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7771,"
Her voice is surprisingly pleasant, but you'd never know how these songs sparkle. Since Cole didn't like to . . . do it with (or ""to"") women very much, maybe the ""do"" is as hostile as it sounds.

FALSE,D-,Homespun,Supa,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7932,"
Every time I think I've run up against the ultimate country-funk inanity--Hookfoot, say--I find someone even dumber. Guess what this lover of the good red Canarsie clay says money won't buy? And what rhymes with buy that he gets on his motorcycle? Gawd.
"
FALSE,D-,Country Music My Way,Shoji Tabuchi,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11272,"
Tabuchi is a trained concert violinist born in Daishji, Japan, who now plays fiddle for David Houston. He also sings. His first album, which would be an instant camp masterpiece in a truly pluralistic culture, is recommended to all those seeking further insight into the musical art of Yoko Ono.

FALSE,D-,2525 (Exordium and Terminus),Zager & Evans,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10850,"
Zager &amp; Evans make Simon &amp; Garfunkel sound like Marx &amp; Engels. The only reason this is not an E is that the title song has sold a million copies. That means they have to be doing something right.
