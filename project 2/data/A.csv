FALSE,A,The Essential Roy Acuff 1936-1949,Roy Acuff,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5995,"
A revered elder in the country is a missing link in the city because there's no sinner in him--the imagination that connects him to Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams is vocal, not moral. But he's not the kind of sickie who thinks pleasure and sin are the same thing--his relish is as palpable as his deep sorrow. So you can hear his moral imagination if you try. And if you want to know why the two things he treasures most are conjugal love and trains, figure he's also not the kind of sickie who thinks contradiction and iniquity are the same thing.

FALSE,A,Aura,King Sunny Ade and His African Beats,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1939,"
Three albums into this world-class popmeister's American career, his U.S. debut begins to seem like the compromise purists claimed it was--not because it's too American, but because it's not American enough. Now when I want something subtly polypercussive I'll choose one of his Nigerian LPs rather than Juju Music. And when I want a heavier, hookier groove I'll pull out Synchro System--or more likely, this one. With Martin Meissonnier back behind the glass and Stevie Wonder's earthbound harmonica on native ground, it's every bit as consistent as The Message and--by (Afro-) American standards--considerably more propulsive. At times it's even obvious, regular. Next time I assume they'll go all out for a dance-chart hit. And I can't wait to hear it.

Of the '82-'83-'84 Island LPs that inspired Ade's dreams of international stardom, Juju Music was a fluently constructed ethnopop sampler, Synchro System a fully integrated Martin Meissonnier album. Here both are seamlessly patched together with two Nigeria-only tracks, a Manu Dibango curtain call, and the Stevie Wonder cameo from Ade's final and best Chris Blackwell project, Aura. Better Sunny's synths than Salif Keita's, and he's never made warmer or hotter records--loaded with fun sounds and Lagos themes, deeper on body bass than talky drum. Only those who own the originals on CD should pass up this recapitulation.

Demonstrating not only that ragtime (Scott Joplin) and New Orleans (Jelly Roll Morton) are Great Art consonant with Contemporary Jazz, but also that they're Corny. And that both Great Art and Corn can be fun. Which is why the somewhat stiff, if not corny, readings of the themes, especially ""King Porter Stomp,"" don't get in the way. Although just what could get in the way of Henry Threadgill improvising over an explicit pulse for a whole album I can't imagine.

She is too a role model--for chart queens, bohemians born-and-raised, and paparazzi victims everywhere. True, her synth-pop album debuted below India.Arie at five before its SoundScan swan dive. But even diving she's more graceful than most, and she has every expectation of popping out of the pool and climbing the ladder again, which is how her first one went gold. Here the modestly likable, oddly uncategorizable singer of Alright, Still emerges as that rare thing, a vocalist of genuine technical command who sounds like no one else--and even rarer, like everygirl at the same time. The snarky lyricist of Alright, Still achieves new amalgams of aesthetic specificity and masscult applicability--the love song ""Who'd Have Known,"" the dad song ""He Wasn't There,"" even the God song ""Him."" She does synth-pop right not by providing a template but by demonstrating its adaptability. Pink, relax. Christina, quiet songs about your baby beckon. Kelly, stop flexing your vocal cords and let your brain do the emoting.

For a decade before the now-departed Manu Chao took them on in 2005, these sincerely opportunistic pros, a couple since the mid '70s and an act for almost as long, were extending their musical outreach with manager Marc Antoine Moreau, who oversaw this follow-up CD as he did all those before Dimanche ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""Sabali"" weirdness that has Alternia all atwitter isn't their kind of thing.

FALSE,A,Greed,Ambitious Lovers,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=165,"
Guess the title's because this is more commercial than Envy, which I guess Arto called that because he was insecure about playing funk and samba. Well, he's not insecure any more. With Peter Scherer melding Brazil and the Black Rock Coalition into a spectrum of astonishing bands, he's sitting on top of one of the sharpest, coolest, bestest funk or samba records ever made--funk as light and samba as pop as the Michaels McDonald or Franks could hope for, only all fused and fucked with. Moments of guitar anarchy (from Vernon Reid or Bill Frisell when chops are called for, from Arto when Arto is) add a New York edge to the tropico hedonism, and there's a consciously childlike playfulness to Arto's vocal technique that's a hemisphere away from the sun-dazed romantic insouciance of his Lusophone mentors. Which certainly isn't to say he lacks insouciance--the bespectacled sometime skronkmaster is as sexy as George Michael when he wants to be, which on these postpostmodern love songs he does. Wonder what Lust will sound like.

Except maybe for Ricky Skaggs, this folksy eccentric sings fewer embarrassing songs than anyone in country music. Unlike Skaggs, he plays at innocence rather than striving for it, which is why there always seems to be something comic bubbling under the eager warmth of his voice. And as you soon learn from lyrics like ""Black Sheep"" and ""Swingin',"" he's unlike Skaggs in another way as well: he's not a moralistic tight-ass.

Taking a deep breath, I dutifully put on side one the moment the box arrived and to my surprise raced through the rest almost consecutively. Then I was able to jump around--which I have, just about daily, ever since. This is partly a function of sheer quantity--hard to get tired of four-and-a-half hours of fairly good anything very fast. Maybe after playing all ten sides five times minimum I should have a favorite, and it's true a few jokes have paled. But even though the live set is more conceptual comedy ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ la Big Science than rockish breakthrough like Mister Heartbreak, the composer-turned-performance-artist's three years as a nominal pop star have done something for her.

FALSE,A,Strange Angels,Laurie Anderson,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2009,"
Anderson feels powerless, a speck of dust at the speed of light, and these are the bleakest songs she's ever written. Positing progress as the force that prevents history from righting itself, she looks the death of nature in its prosthetic eye and sees bad changes coming a lot sooner than, for instance, equal pay for women, which she calculates is due along about 3888. But she also feels connected to the pop firmament, often constructing her lyrics like a human sampler, and this is the most mellifluous music she's ever recorded. She's taken voice lessons to match the tunes she's writing, and hired sidepeople--notably Graceland bassist Bakithi Khumalo, whose fretless flow unifies the four lithest tracks--who she knows will add a savvy, sensual sheen to her most cerebral constructs. Some find these two pop moves a mark of compromise; I find them pleasingly complex. A soothing glimpse of the end of the world.

FALSE,A,Inside My Brain,Angry Samoans,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=119,"
Like so many of their coscenemakers, these dorks cultivate race and sex shock; one of them has had unkind words for his ""adopted Jew parents,"" and the band's abuse of a ""pathetic male queer"" is now on record. But these six foreshortened songs, self-destructing in under ten minutes total, sum up the only hard-core punks to put the social distortion they yell about on the map. Sure a lot of what's inside their brains started somewhere else, but that's where it ended up, and by copping to their part--even their ""new generation"" anthem-if-you-want-to-call-it-that is called ""Right Side of My Brain""--they give themselves a shot at beating it, by whatever means necessary. They're solipsistic enough to claim the gone girlfriend in ""You Stupid Asshole"" no longer exists, and fair enough to add that they're stupid assholes themselves. And they insult Rodney Bingenheimer, which must be why skinheads think they go too far. If Carly Simon can make great rock and roll, why not them?

An LP in format and perceived weight, a seventeen-minute EP in real-time length, this is the most offensive record I've ever liked, and damn near perfect if superannuated hardcore with metal hooks could be your meat. Todd Homer is good enough to half convince me he's as demented as he sounds, and I don't mean in a cute way--I pity anyone (especially any female) who has to treat him like a human. ""They Saved Hitler's Cock"" is the most brutal and ludicrous of these fourteen frags, ""Homo-sexual"" (""I'm like you"") and ""Ballad of Jerry Curlan"" (""drinks toilet water takes it up the ass butt-fucks his dog"") the scariest. All of 'em are catchy. And almost every one give me a laugh.

FALSE,A,Gimme Samoa: 31 Garbage-Pit Hits,Angry Samoans,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=121,"
There's something heart-warmingly perverse about turning these proud piggos into yuppie fodder, and after all, how many other major '80s bands could fit their entire recorded output onto one pricy piece of plastic-coated aluminum five inches in diameter? Including even a few outtakes--the same ones that pad PVC's rerelease of Inside My Brain into something collectors might respring for, and I must admit they're growing on me. Some disparage the Samoans as incipient Dead Milkmen, which isn't such a terrible insult and also misses how disturbing they were--Rodney Bingenheimer wasn't their only enemy. In fact, maybe they still are disturbing--maybe that analysis is a pornography-is-boring move, an attempt to trivialize the threatening. Always a reluctant fan, I find that their bad attitudes reinforce each other played back to back in this format: hard, catchy, unashamed straight-teen-male hostility so funny that there's no denying the educational value of its self-knowledge, though maybe more for observers than participants. In very short, a punk touchstone.

Rock 'n' roll doesn't need Robert Schneider's ""non-Pythagorean"" scales to combat mind-body dualism. But Schneider's romance with ELO was just what he needed to add heft to his Beatles fixation--the aura of middlebrow seriousness puts his formalist musings on track. ""And the world is made of energy/And the world is possibility"" is Heraclitean pop at its cutest and acutest, the drug advice addresses prescription meds and he understands the fatal parallel between information and radiation, which is that too much of either can make you sick. Even the Mellotron interludes compute on the album where the Elephant Six finally get their shtick together.

Guitars screeching every which way, beats speeding and hesitating and slamming chaos back into the box, twentysomething boyvoices whining and arguing and drawling and straining, it's the world according to indie rock: a tantrum set to music as sharp and self-contained as a comedy routine.

Eric Bachmann's pissed-off, speechlike yowl-to-croak isn't as callow or pop as Stephen Malkmus's demented, speechlike croon-to-whine, but their bands share an aural gestalt: tuneful two-guitar breaks that set off unkempt explosions before recombining in brief climaxes soon interrupted by more disarray. The Archers trace the agitated melodies and off guitar to the Replacements, as if the clamor Bob Stinson unloosed by accident and spirit possession was instead planned out by former sax major Bachmann and axe-wielding bad boy Eric Johnson. With Paul Westerberg an adept of the realistic popsong and the Archers' titles so gnomic they forget them themselves, I resisted this notion until the show where I caught myself shouting out a whole utterly comprehensible stanza: ""They caught and drowned the front man/Of the world's worst rock and roll band/He was out of luck/Because nobody gave a fuck/The jury gathered all around the aqueduct/Drinking and laughing and lighting up/Reminiscing just how bad he sucked/Singin' throw him in the river/Throw him in the river/Throw him in the river/Throw the bastard in the river.""

With his innovations long since institutionalized, Armstrong's Ambassador of Jazz period is often accused of lost spark. Four songs on this budget set from the mid-'50s had been in his repertoire so long that they're also featured in the box, and you needn't back-to-back them to hear the difference--where earlier he was exploring his gifts and establishing his rights, here he's recreating his triumphs, revving set pieces into what has come to be understood as ""Dixieland,"" preparing effects that no one on either side of the footlights doubts will be forthcoming. And forthcome they fucking well do. No man as strong as Louis Armstrong entertains out of contempt--he lives to give pleasure, and he's so confident in his love for this material that he can do anything he wants to it. ""Rockin' Chair"" and ""That's My Desire"" are as funny as death and sex, which he knows damn well they're about. ""Black and Blue"" isn't funny at all.

Put off my feed by a single godawful piano solo, I fretted that this post-WWII overview was too lax. Certainly he recorded many of these 60 tunes many times; in other versions, seven are on Columbia/Legacy's 16 Most Requested Songs, an utterly convincing budget-priced survey of Armstrong the Beloved, the Entertainer--the Icon. A few selections here are merely lovable and entertaining, not iconic. But having played all three discs many times--Louis is one artist the boy-group fan in the back seat will always settle for--I've yet to locate another moment I'd rather not hear. Armstrong is my favorite artist because he epitomizes what Gary Giddins's newly reissued Satchmo breaks down as the entertainer-as-artist/artist-as-entertainer: ""He was as much himself rolling his eyes and mugging as he was playing the trumpet. His fans understood that, but intellectuals found the whole effect too damn complicated.""

Less than brilliantly recorded, though most '40s jazz boots are much worse, this May 12 experiment, featuring the template for the All-Stars combos he led for the rest of his life, is the Armstrong I play when I want the whole package. Quickly this mode gravitated toward the standard repertoire that dominates the albums I go to for late Louis: the American Icon set and 16 Most Requested Songs. But here the sell was a return to the format of his youth after years of mediocre big bands, so it begins with ""Cornet Chop Suey,"" ""Dear Old Southland,"" ""Big Butter and Egg Man."" Later there's newer stuff, though ""Back o' Town Blues"" and ""Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans"" are a long way from ""Mack the Knife"" and ""Hello Dolly.""  Either way the committed, ebullient performances have something to prove. And as a bonus this is Armstrong's only recording with genre-hopping powerhouse Sid Catlett, who should have been his drummer forever but quit fast and died all too soon.

Ashley's previous recorded excursion into pulse-plus-words quasi-rock was appealingly hypnotic, but I thought it inauspicious that when I heard and saw this piece live early in 1980 I had a hard time staying awake. No such omens with the album, which is like a state-of-the-art update of the Velvets' ""Murder Mystery."" One improvement is that you can follow the words, which offer both hook phrases (""We don't serve fine wines in half-pints buddy"") and literary satisfaction (dialogue/confrontation between white common-sense-materialist bartender and black cocktail pianist of mystical mien). Also gratifying is the ironic poppish context Ashley finds for the avant-MOR blandouts of such Soho luminaries as producer-arranger Peter Gordon and keyboardist-arranger ""Blue"" Gene Tyranny.

Cut in 1952 with a skilled Oscar Peterson sextet, Verve's Steppin' Out: Astaire Sings is the class entry, but I much prefer this unabashed slice of nostalgia, recorded in the mid-'30s with various cheesy dance bands (and the occasional tap solo). Pushing 40, Astaire still sounds boyish--his perilously slender voice embodies the naive sophistication he invented, and from it he extracts a wealth of true notes and meanings. For all his commitment to pitch, there's something very rock and roll about the way he transcends his disadvantages with smarts, personality, and rhythmic savvy. No wonder Berlin and the rest preferred him to the orotund competition--with no tonsils to show off, he devotes himself to the songs, and he owns them.

Because she's smart enough to know the difference between a mixtape and an album, she earns the right to treat this official debut as the one that counts--no filler, no throwaways, no riding her smash, no withholding her smash either. Musically and lyrically, every track is thought through, with debts called in and incurred. The Noo Yawk accent she's right to lean on is so blunt that she's not a truly fluent rhymer, so she does well to pull in Chance's flow, Migos's trickeration, Pete Rodriguez's clave. And lyrically, her aim is true. ""Write a verse while I twerk / I wear off-white in church""? Tell it, sister. ""Only thing fake is the boobs""? Ca-ching.

But they're also turntablism with spoken decoration, of small use to anyone who hasn't internalized the ""real"" hip hop aesthetic. Adding seven songs from their three excellent later albums to the debut's four groundbreaking masterworks, this is where the rest of us go with their flow; I don't know another hip hop album that sweeps by so easily and rapidly. Not that there are no bumps--in a way, the terrain is all bumps. Sometimes the effect is mountain-hopping the rooftops, more often kayaking through Hell Gate.

And as the subtitle knows, they weren't about songwriting--this was a band band, one of the few with the talent, experience, discipline, and love to bend master chops to a downpressed style. There are no weak links or even unequal partners. Sure H.R. and Dr. Know got the attention, but skank scholar Darryl Jenifer and power polymath Earl Hudson stand just as proud.

Maybe her sources are autobiographical, but she's here to inspire all black-identified women and the men who admire them. On ""Cleva,"" she predicts you'll love her for her mind as her ninnies sag; on ""Booty,"" she pulls more good stuff with her G.E.D. than you can with your Ph.D. And to prove how smart she is once and for all, she accentchuates her word power with structures, arrangements, hooks, the works.

Baker was the genius journeyman for whom Dave Hickey devised the freelancer's epitaph: ""If This Dude Wasn't Dead, He Could Still Get Work.""

His adore-the-melody trick has its limits unless his white Oklahoman affect touches you like it does Hickey, the white Texan son of a swing musician with bebop dreams. So this is ideal. As someone who's always preferred Baker's singing to his trumpet, I was surprised to find that three vocals were only one short of what I would have preferred (words on ""It Never Entered My Mind"" later on, please), and surprised to swoon for the instrumental opener, a 1952 ""My Funny Valentine"" the notes claim was a hit. I was also surprised to hear more romance--and less ""cool""--in this ""My Funny Valentine""'s lyricism, sensuality, and bassline than in the contemporaneous version that opens Miles Davis Plays for Lovers. Thank Baker's smooth, soft, full, breathy sound. Thank Gerry Mulligan, Zoot Sims, and (on the two jazz compositions) Johnny Griffin. Thank Paul Chambers. Thank the melodies.

Four tracks, 14 minutes of music, topped inevitably by ""212"" (and if you're not among the video's 20 million hits, succumb now). All of said songs top this eye-on-the-prize Harlemite's many other YouTube offerings, some of which might in turn sound dandy mixed into the mixtape and official album we are assured will soon-come. One might bitch about the chopped-and-screwed monologue that brings total time to 16 minutes, only it's funnier and more pointed than the Clyde Smith skits it bites from Ghostface. So I hope this is the dancey hip-hop Nicki Minaj's haters claim to miss and know full well it's too effing dancey for 'em--not to mention too virtuosic, beatwise, layered, less-is-more, and much.

The articulation of our most musical young rapper is crystalline without flaunting its precision. Her singing rolls full and easy from somewhere in her torso. The grain of her voice is both pretty and sensual. And unlike her male counterparts she doesn't equate sex with power--there's verbal as well as vocal evidence that she feels it elsewhere than her genitalia. That said, she does seem to equate rapping with power--her troubles are the usual star-time overindulgences, and just about every terrific song here is a boast one way or another. Yet just about every song is a serious pleasure regardless. Here's hoping that when she achieves the security she deserves, she uses her IQ for something more useful than battling a melanin-deprived rival who admits more vulnerabilities than she does.

FALSE,A,"Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit.",Courtney Barnett,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16335,"
I insist that the most striking advance here is musical, as her Melbourne g-b-d rock out where formerly they strummed her weaker material into oblivion. Not like Nirvana or something--they're nowhere near that galvanic. But they pack the kind of drive and focus that convince the listener every song matters to the people who are playing it, with the singer-songwriter's committed vocals the clincher. I'll concede, however, that song quality per se could have inspired this effect, because these don't quit. Take this casual opener from ""Dead Fox,"" which you'd best believe scans: ""Jen insists that we buy organic vegetables and I must admit I was a little sceptical at first a little pesticide can't hurt."" Triangulates her culturally--soon we learn that she's always found organic kind of pricey. But what I love most is the half-rhymes that half-link the ""vegetables""-""sceptical""-""pesticide"" polysyllables before she continues an autobiographical reminiscence based on a road trip through cattle country. That's Barnett's m.o. Formally, her songs are confessional, only they describe her material life and conflicted feelings acutely rather than dreamily, so that the songs occur in and are inflected by a deftly rendered physical and social world. ""Dead Fox"" isn't even a standout. You want one of those, try ""Depreston,"" in which a house-shopping expedition is stopped dead by a Vietnam snapshot the deceased owner has left behind. Say Barnett is Jens Lekman only folk-grunge not pop. Say she's John Prine as a lesbian boho 40 years his junior from the other side of the globe and maybe tracks. Say she's herself. Hope she remains so.

All public endeavors have their journeymen, and if Steve Wynn and Scott McCaughey aren't obscurities like Ryan Freel and Alfredo Amezaga, they're certainly half flashes like Ty Wigginton and Willie Bloomquist--diligent, productive, enduring, their great moments well gone now and also not all that great. That would be the Dream Syndicate and the Young Fresh Fellows, although this band-in-concept-only is more like McCaughey's shifting Minus Five, complete with retro-alt songcraft and Peter Buck moonlighting away. It turns out that, like folk music before it, the static, jangly retro-alt template makes a dandy setting for topical songs. Just going by tune and lyrical hook, the only dud here is McCaughey's weeper about Mark McGwire, and as an amateur expert in the field I swear several hit the ball on the sweet spot: tributes to Curt Flood, Harvey Haddix, Big Ed Delahanty, and a closer with his arm like hamburger meat.

FALSE,A,The Best of Early Basie,Count Basie,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10795,"
It was the sure shots of the Basie Ken Burns Jazz that enabled me to go back and hear this 1996 budget item. Late Basie is as springy as brass plush gets. But though Orrin Keepnews's big-band focus is purist--this would still have been a unified record if he'd made room for Helen Humes pop and gone out on a terse piano feature like ""Hey Lawdy Mama""--jazzbos don't divide Basie into Old and New Testament just because he's a god. Not all 21 tunes here are as indelible as ""One O'Clock Jump."" But most are close enough, and deliver the prime pleasures of Basie at his most original: Bill's uncannily understated theme, Lester's insouciant honk, and a bandleader's dozen of superb musicians in the service of volume and beat. True, amplifiers soon achieved a similar effect with less fuss. But the amplifier has never been a solo instrument.

Painfully crackpot and painfully sung, but also inspired, not least because it calls forth forbidden emotions. For a surrogate teenager to bare his growing pains so guilelessly was exciting, or at least charming; for an avowed adult to expose an almost childish naivete is embarrassing, but also cathartic; and for a rock and roll hero to compose a verbally and musically irresistible paean to Johnny Carson is an act of shamanism pure and simple. As with Wild Honey, the music sounds wrong in contradictory ways at first--both arty and cute, spare and smarmy--but on almost every cut it comes together soon enough; I am especially partial to the organ textures, and I find the absurd little astrology ditty, ""Solar System,"" impossible to shake. As for the words, well, they're often pretty silly, but even (especially) when they're designed to appeal to whatever Brian imagines to be the rock audience they reveal a lot more about the artist than most lyrics do. And this artist is a very interesting case.

One reason nobody knew what they'd do for an encore is that Licensed to Ill redefined rap as music: it was avant-garde rap and pop metal, foregrounding riffs and attitude any hedonist could love while eliminating wack solos and dumb-ass posturing. Jam-packed, frenetic, stark, the sequel isn't as user-friendly. But give it three plays and half a j's worth of concentration, and its high-speed volubility and riffs from nowhere will amaze and delight you. It's an absolutely unpretentious and unsententious affirmation of cultural diversity, of where they came from and where they went from there. They drop names from Cï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½zanne to Jelly Roll Morton to Sadaharu Oh, sample the Funky Four Plus One (twice), Johnny Cash, Charlie Daniels, Public Enemy, the Wailers, Eek-a-Mouse (I think), Jean Knight, and Ricky Skaggs (I think) just as tags--for music there are counot cheeba, not pussy, certainly not fame. The Beasties are still bad--they get laid, they do drugs, they break laws, they laze around. But they know the difference between bad and evil. Crack and cocaine and woman-beaters and stickup kids get theirs; one song goes out to a homeless rockabilly wino, another ends, ""Racism is schism on the serious tip."" Here's hoping other bad boys take these bad boys seriously.

Rap is their heritage, and having wasted years proving they can't play their instruments while enrapturing MTV fans who loved them for trying, they come home not an album too soon--flowing prose to cons and cons to pros, scheming rhymes against reason like flow against know. Old-school in their spare breakbeats, skilled back-scratching, and heavy-breathing beatbox, they also remember how to lay on the guitar, and dance like Juba through missteps from planet-rock Vocoder to Roy Ayers carioca to good old Hammond B-3. And of course they rhyme, wise and wiseass, humanitarian without ever getting sappy about it--and without mentioning the Dalai Lama once.

A tribute not only to the Beatles (which figured) but to George Martin and Capitol (which didn't necessarily figure at all). The sound rings clearly and powerfully through the shrieking: the segues are brisk and the punch-ins imperceptible; and the songs capture our heroes at their highest. Furthermore, though the musicianship is raw, the arrangements are tighter (faster, actually) than on record; Ramones-haters should note that the thirteen tunes take less than twenty-nine minutes, including patter.

Guitars vestigial, jokes brittle sometimes but no less funny, Paul Heaton's finest album evolves toward the calling he was born too late for: music hall. Like such northern stars as Dan Leno and George Formby Sr., he voices the sharp-witted resentments of working stiffs resigned to their lot. Or maybe not: from ""Don't marry her, fuck me"" to ""Imagine a mirror/Bigger than the room it was placed in,"" a few women here see beyond the repressive depression of English suburban life, where one of two husbands drinks as much as Heaton and the other is as boring as Phil Collins--and the loners are tedious souses. The triumph in this vein is ""Liars Bar,"" the greatest in a long line of drinking songs by the man who's said: ""I consider myself a workaholic, it's just that I like to have a drink while I'm working."" It comes with a video in which a disheveled Heaton leads a chorus of homeless drunks through a lurching soft shoe like a born variety artist. ""I'm a standup comedian,"" he sings, and it sounds like a job application.

Not a groove record, and not a hook record either. An instrumentally fluent texture record serving an articulately sung melody record, led to its sweetly clamorous fate by Dischord art-pop hand Chad Clark, whose last album came out in 2004. Since then he's taken up the laptop sampling that dominates so gorgeously here, in part to occupy months if not years spent laid out by a cardiac virus and its open-heart surgeries. All his gentle tunes and surprising sounds contextualize lyrics that both parse and come at you from trick angles. The song about his heart, for instance, begins with a woman fixing her makeup in the rear-view two miles before she crashes to her death; in other news, a frozen mastodon swears never again, Malawi gays flee police, and an Afrikaner barista is assured ""origin's not destination."" (Haven't mentioned--Clark is black.) Foremost among the many who pitch in is the lovely Jean Cook on violin, samisen, and voice. It's she who delivers this Inspirational Verse: ""You'll find that money is noise / This--us, together!--is wealth / The body is just cosines and vectors / Love is the real health.""

His clip file is home to a bigheaded kid who's memorized Bob Dylan's Playboy interview, a slacker version of the Pretentious Asshole--here a folkie there a punk everywhere an image-slinger (with absurdist tendencies, mais oui). But his album barely contains an exuberant experimenter whose verbiage coheres on record--either because he knows records are history or because repetition tamps down the loose ends. He's a folkie-punk version of, well, the Young Bob Dylan, except that he also loves hooks enough to cast his net wider than the Young David Johansen, finding them everywhere from an electric sitar to an illicitly taped tirade from a ""Vietnam vet playin' air guitar"" downstairs. Full of fun and loaded with 'tude, he doesn't care what you think of him and makes you love it, right down to the nose-thumbing bummer dirges that close each side. Proving how cool you are by making an album that sounds like shit is easy. Proving how cool you are by making an album that comes this close to sounding like shit is damn hard--unless you're damn talented.

FALSE,A,The Chess Box,Chuck Berry,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15734,"
Starting at age 29 in 1955, Chuck Berry recorded plenty, mostly for Chess in Chicago, a spin in the Caddy from his St. Louis home. Many of these recordings were epochal, others pretty great. But quite a few fell short. In the golden age of Top 40, his albums were afterthought product, filled out with autopilot instrumentals, threadbare covers, wan novelties, and temperate lounge blues. So Chuck Berry's natural longform is the best-of, compelling fans to buy his classics over and over. This 71-track threefer from the innocent days when box sets meant something slackens slightly on the back half of disc two by indulging Berry's blues dreams. But disc three documents the renaissance that followed his release from an 18-month bid on a trumped-up prostitution charge in late 1963. The unsatisfied ""No Particular Place to Go"" and the pot-dealing action thriller ""Tulane"" aren't iconic like ""Johnny B. Goode,"" but their artistry, invention, and humor are unsurpassed, and ""Tulane"" led directly to ""Have Mercy Judge,"" the only important blues he ever wrote.

Set me back 30 bucks, but shit--the box itself has a nice velvety feel. True, the booklet collects 20 video stills that squeeze the credits onto a single pink-on-black page, the 2015 calendar shows off a mostly b&amp;w pin-up girl whose cunningly unkempt designer outfits we'll meet again when we get to the videos, and the elaborately overworked videos themselves should be approached with extreme caution--after you know the music, please. But where most live DVDs are de trop, this one rules, not just for Ms. Knowles's legendary stage discipline and expert dance routines but for a star-time visage further beautified by how readily it projects empathy, humor, and fun to fans who get it all. And of course, the reason to forswear the videos is to give the songs time to breathe, which they will--especially but not exclusively the sex sequence, which over seven well-differentiated tracks performs the unlikely feat of conveying an opeeroticism that varies because Mrs. Carter knows eroticism does, for each of us in our individual responses as well as for her. So let's agree that Queen Bey is at best a useful metaphor--when she tries to sing the part and gets all regal on our ass, her majesty quickly becomes a bore. Representing lust, on the other hand, loosens her up. Enter the bonus disc called ""More"": filthier ""Drunk in Love,"" nastier ""Flawless,"" cuter ""Blow,"" high-rolling party song ""7/11,"" Caribbean outtake ""Standing in the Sun,"" and the sisterly, daughterly ""Ring Off,"" in which the queen mother leaves her doggish husband and about time too. Best Bey ever.

Fond as I am of the pop junk they recycle--with love and panache, like the closet ecologists they are--there's something parochially suburban about turning it into the language of a world view. So I'm more delighted with their rhythms, which show off their Georgia roots by adapting the innovations of early funk (a decade late, just like the Stones and Chicago blues) to an endlessly danceable forcebeat format. Also delightful is their commitment to sexual integration--Cindy Wilson is singing more and more, although her voice occasionally gives out before her ambitions do. Major worry: only one of the copyright 1979 songs--my favorite track, ""Dance This Mess Around""--is as amazing as the 1978 stuff.

The B-52's I bonded with at Max's and CBGB were an art band who epitomized the lost bohemian ideal of camp as love--embodied it so fully that after unspeakable adversity they became the thing they took off on and from. But while I could cavil about edgier song choices and '90s shortfall and their firstest was their bestest, I know that their chosen legacy honors the band that belongs to the ages and the masses--the pop band that still launches keg parties on Myrtle Beach and sells khakis at the Gap. From ""Private Idaho"" to ""Good Stuff,"" songs I've never cared for are pure fun here. So are songs I've always adored. And the main thing wrong with the two new ones is that they're not fit to shine the spaceship of 1992's visionary ""Is That You Mo-Dean?"" Personal to all tailgaters: the debut's really cool. Er, hot. What you said.

Boosters claim this is just what the AM has been waiting for, but the only pop coup I hear is a reminder of how spare, skew, and sprung the Beatles '65 were, which is a coup because they weren't. The harmonies sound like the lead sheets are upside down and backwards, the guitar solos sound like screwball readymade pastiches, and the lyrics sound like love is strange, though maybe that's just the context.

How dare people call this wondrous album--actual quotes, now--""insipid,"" ""saccharine,"" ""clumsy""? Only I don't mean people--I mean journalists professional and self-appointed, from rockist sourpusses to keepers of the hip-hop flame. Just plain people love it--love it so much that various of its tracks topped the pop charts nonstop for the entire summer. ""Party All the Time"" is no more a recipe for living than is instant Wi-Fi for all, the message of the supposedly ""political"" ""Now Generation."" But in a party anthem it's the definition of intelligence. Sampling classic rap rapaciously and as cool with Auto-Tune as with getting their drunk on, they party beginning to end, which as it happens is a far rarer achievement than signifying beginning to end. Maybe this album is dumb on the surface, though not as much as fools claim. But sure as showbiz it isn't dumb underneath.

As even they may realize eventually, they never were much of an art band--just such a good rock and roll band you'd sit still for their bullshit. Despite the uneven pre-Damaged tracks, this beer-party compilation sums up their contribution to Western civilization quite neatly.

Uhuru's three U.S. releases after Red were so disappointing that I ignored this when it came out in England late last year, but I understand why those who didn't resent the dub/disco effects now mixed into ""What Is Life?"" and ""Botanical Roots"" and ""Try It."" All the songs are so strong and catchy and righteous--so anthemic--that it seems perverse to distract from them in any way. But they're also so strong they stand up to the treatment. The plus on the U.S. version is the cover--Rufus's ""Somebody's Watching You"" was an interesting choice competently rendered, while Steve Van Zandt's ""Solidarity"" is a very interesting choice that turns wishful thinking into dream come true.

The finest reggae group of the '80s--maybe ever, behind the obvious, or until somebody with ears and all-label access does a Culture comp. In two decades solo, Michael Rose has never approached the spirit groove he hit regularly with Duckie Simpson, the great Puma Jones, and the greater Sly &amp; Robbie, who in turn peaked with this band. Its best album was its last with Rose, 1984's Anthem, and its only previous comp, 1993's Liberation double, is mucked up with dubs and 12-inch mixes aimed at some combination of the ganja/dancehall markets. Only one such here, and only two Anthem tracks--just songs as songs, inextricable from S&amp;R's thick, echoing rhythms, Jones's female principle, and Rose's exultation in his own powers. There's lots of exultation on this record. But even ""Sponji Reggae"" and ""Happiness"" proceed explicitly from suffering.

His strapping young voice set apart by his trademarked gargling snort as well as a falsetto he claims he found when he had his tonsils out, Bland was never more puissant than when knuckling under the broad thumb of Don Robey, the label owner (they hadn't invented executive producers yet) who surfaces in parentheses as song-copywriter Deadric Malone. ""Turn On Your Love Light,"" ""Farther up the Road,"" ""I Pity the Fool""--you'd think they'd always been there, so familiar are their tropes and tunes. But they were tailored to a specific voice and market, defining upwardly mobile blues in a moment when r&amp;b was wide open. Later Bland would lean into the soul beat of ""These Hands (Small but Mighty)"" and the pop-Latin lilt of ""Call on Me,"" incite harmonettes into chirping ""Yield not to temptation."" But postblues are his home ground. And most of the time, Jabo Starks is his drummer.

You may remember this Diplo-backed B'more DJ from Maya, where three of his productions were relegated to the bonus section that sealed the damn album. (Did you like ""Illygirl""? That's his.) A full-length is projected, and he's just dropped a free mixtape that demonstrates his range in that scattered mixtape way. But there's nothing scattered about this EP, which slipped out unnoticed on M.I.A.'s vanity label in January. Simple, obsessive electrobeats are augmented by pitch-corrected chants and marked with minimal lyrics. ""Oh My Darling"" is ""about"" a fantasy dancer, ""Rider Girl"" steals Rye Rye's car keys, (Ricky) ""Divine"" invites the licking of ice cream, ""Wonder Woman"" licks a gun instead, and it's my inconvenient duty to report that the iTunes version adds a somewhat peppier song that I recommend even though it changes up a tone that I'm free to suspect is what sipping sizzurp feels like because I'll never find out.

""Train whistle cries / lost on its own track"" could be half a haiku for Hank Williams should these American traditionalists ever turn Japanese, and if ""Leaving"" is worthy of George Jones, ""Bus Station"" and ""It Must Be Love"" pick up where Tom T. Hall left off. None of which is code for countrybilly--this is r&amp;b Jerry Lee could be proud of. It's just that Dave Alvin writes with an objective colloquial intensity that fits the straight-ahead dedication of his cross-racial and -generational band the way James Taylor's ingrown whimsy suited the laid-backs he hung with. In other words, Dave might qualify as the last great singer-songwriter if only he was a singer. And brother Phil is.

Non Fiction imagined a world in which the American music the Blasters love remained the common tongue of ordinary guys, guys whose connection to their cultural history helped them understand where they were--not in control, but at least conscious. The follow-up attempts to reach those ordinary guys with producers and stereo and more drums and no horns and a John Cougar Mellencamp song, and also with the kind of fancy stuff that comes naturally--accordion here, acoustic version there, Jordanaires all over the place, and the Jubilee Train Singers on a fiercely joyous remake of ""Samson and Delilah,"" which with its ancient threat to tear this building down is good reason not to fret about philosophical retreat. As are ""Dark Night,"" about a race murder, and ""Common Man,"" about some president or other, their two most pointedly political tracks ever. What's softened is the bits of the writing--where Non Fiction nailed specifics (plastic seats, repentant husband wiping ashes off the bed), here Dave Alvin settles (or works) for a level of generalization suitable to pop. Guess he's decided that sometimes ordinary guys don't want things spelled out so fine. He may be right.

Too bad this'll be catalogued under Bley's name, because it's significant as the earliest recording of Ornette Coleman's great quartet, featuring Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, and Billy Higgins. Although Bley led the date, the engineering (i.e., where he put the tape recorder) is so involuntarily self-effacing that Bley is hard to hear even when he solos and impossible to hear when he comps. But the blowing comes through loud and clear, looser and closer to bebop than the familiar early Coleman on Atlantic, and I have the feeling that when I want people to understand what free jazz meant, this is what I'll play.

As unlikely as it seemed three years ago, they've actually achieved their synthesis of the Dixie Cups and the Electric Prunes--their third is as close to God as pop-rock albums ever get, or got. Closer, actually--even on side two every song generates its own unique, scintillating glitz. What seems at first like a big bright box of hard candy turns out to have guts, feeling, a chewy center, and Deborah Harry's vocal gloss reveals nooks of compassion and sheer physical give that makes the protagonists of these too-too modern fragments seem as tragic (or untragic) as those of any other epoch.

I prefer this to, say, Blythe's more conventionally ""free"" Bush Baby (on Adelphi) because--thanks to Jack DeJohnette, Guillermo Franco, and the lilt of Blythe's theme vamps--its passion for popular rhythms enables it to say something about them. The sinuous Latin groove of ""Down San Diego Way"" wends through three of the four tracks. But while the California opener is unfailingly sunny, the groove runs into two-way traffic on the title tune and suffers further cross-comment on the bluesy ""Slidin' Through"" before disappearing into ""Odessa."" Just as Steely Dan's lyrics (and chord changes, I suppose) work against the surface mellowness of the music, so the strength of the groove here is challenged and transformed by solo voices and alien rhythms without ever being defeated, much less exploited for its ""accessibility."" And if we're interested, all this conflict helps us understand why music like Bush Baby exists.

The way La Bowie's vaunted concept albums reduce to greatest hits is a revelation. Non-dross form the likes of Diamond Dogs and Young Americans holds its own with the best discrete songs from Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, and what's more, chronology resembles progress--like the Supremes regressing from ""Where Did Our Love Go"" to ""Love Child"" in reverse, although not as important aesthetically.

Miraculously, Bowie's attraction to black music has matured; even more miraculously, the new relationship seems to have left his hard-and-heavy side untouched. Ziggyphiles can call it robotoid if they want--I admire the mechanical, fragmented, rather secondhand elegance of Aladdin Sane, and this adds soul. All of the six cuts are too long, I suppose, including the one that originated with Johnny Mathis, and David sounds like he's singing to us via satellite. But spaceyness has always been part of his shtick, and anybody who can merge Lou Reed, disco, and Huey Smith--the best I can do with the irresistible ""TVC 15""--deserves to keep doing it for 5:29.

It isn't just the usual useless bonuses that make the self-serving Sound + Vision unlistenable--Bowie's personal reissue program monumentalizes a monumentally inefficient music machine. Sure he can hit the nail on the head, sometimes for a whole side (first five tracks of Hunky Dory, which now yields a prev unrel good song) or even album (the just-out Station to Station, though these days I find myself making allowances for ""Stay"" as well as the Johnny Mathis cover--and welcoming the prev unrel live bait). But he's always churned out pomp and dreck, especially in theatre mode. So given his nonstop chameleon act, the consistency of this 18-cut best-of--the superb Changesonebowie plus not much Changestwobowie and too much Let's Dance--is an industrial marvel.

FALSE,A,Mermaid Avenue,Billy Bragg & Wilco,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=316,"
Here's this Brit folksinger, a punk by heritage and a pop star by ambition whose most salient talent is how guiltlessly he mixes up the three. And here's this middle-American alt band, folkies by sensibility and pop pros by ambition whose most salient talent is a musicality they don't know what to do with. With the wisdom of half a century's ripoffs behind them, both are more resourceful melodically than the icon whose thousands of unpublished lyrics they were chosen to make something of. So be glad he kept the tunes in his head. Because while the words are wonderful and unexpected--author of several published books and reams of journalism, Woody Guthrie might have made his mark in any literary calling--it's the music, especially Wilco's music, that transfigures the enterprise. Projecting the present back on the past in an attempt to make the past signify as future, they create an old-time rock and roll that never could have existed. Finally--folk-rock!

Ahh, get over it. For one simple reason: if you shut him out, if you let it bother you that he's full of shit, your sex life will suffer. Especially compared to Garth's, which last time the Enquirer checked was still with one woman, although songs like ""Last Summer"" (cowritten by his wife, who must do her share of fantasy work) keep him in touch with his urges. He enjoyed his amazing run, summed up for the cynical set by this 18-track stocking-stuffer, because he has the most voracious emotional appetite of anyone to hit pop music since Aretha Franklin, and because he's such a perfectionist that he always threads his big feelings through the eye of a succinct narrative or sentiment. I just wish he'd announced for the Senate when David Boren retired.

FALSE,A,Sex Machine,James Brown,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1638,"
Some doubt the claim that this was recorded in concert in Augusta, Georgia, but everyone believes in the music. On ""Get Up I Feel Like Being a Sex Machine"" he creates a dance track even more compelling than the single out of the same five elements: light funk-four on the traps, syncopated bass figure, guitar scratched six beats to the bar, and two voices for call and response. When he modulates to the bridge it's like the Spirit of God moving upon the face of the waters. After that he could describe his cars for three sides and get away with it (hope this doesn't give him any bright ideas), but in fact all of what remains is prime JB except for the organ version of ""Spinning Wheel"" (horn bands will out) and the cover of ""If I Ruled the World"" (thought he already did). Side four, with its powerful ""Man's World,"" is especially fine, closing with a soul-wrenching scream that says it all.

FALSE,A,Jazz Goes to College,The Dave Brubeck Quartet,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15836,"
Released in 1954, Brubeck's first album for Columbia--he'd done plenty for Fantasy, including several also recorded at colleges--is my favorite, and while there are many I haven't heard, I've put in enough hours to advise against anything with an orchestra or without Paul Desmond. This one comes with extra jam mostly because the recent substitution of drummer Joe Dodge spurred Brubeck to wing two key tracks, ""Balcony Rock"" and ""Le Souk."" Its title bestowed by a&amp;r man George Avakian just as the rock 'n' roll fad was learning its name, ""Balcony Rock"" is that doubly rare thing in Brubeck's oeuvre, a blues jam, and although Brubeck is oft praised for his classical touch, the block chords of his solo bump rather than arpeggiate, which many young folks preferred even in 1954. Desmond's harmonies impart a Middle Eastern tinge to ""Le Souk,"" which Brubeck revs to a nice runaway feel, but on the standards that fill out the set the Apollonian alto saxophonist is at his lyrical best. Note too the memorable ""Take the A Train,"" built around yet another blocky Brubeck solo. In rhythm music, blocky generally beats tinkly. Just ask Neil Young.

It's hip-hop, all right, only with vocals white as Hank Snow. As this Maritime yokel turned Paris sojourner likes to say, ""Street credibility--zero. Dirt road credibility--up the yin-yang."" That's despite a black presence in Halifax going back to the Underground Railroad--and also despite dense, bassy beatbeds built the old-fashioned way, from handmade scratches and anonymous samples tweaked and tortured. These nods to tradition are overshadowed by his gravelly murmur, his Jimmy Stewart accent, his single steady cadence, his guitars without a trace of funk--and above all by his independence of hip-hop orthodoxy. His art wouldn't exist without hip-hop and he knows it, but it's also bigger than hip-hop, and at some level he knows that too. Begins with a boast, ends with a gun, and in between come allegories and tall tales, travel vignettes, a romantic confession of uncommon delicacy and candor, detailed first-person portraits of a perfectionist bootblack and a ""roadhog with an old dog singin' slow songs tryin' to hold on."" You say you want funny too? You got it.

FALSE,A,Untrue,Burial,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13864,"
Unlike most New Ambient, Burial's music is emotional, which helps its funk a lot, and eventful, which helps its interest even more. Fifteen years ago, we would have called it trip-hop or, stupidly, illbient (remember that one?). Now it's supposedly dubstep. I wouldn't quite class this with Maxinquaye--melodies and voices could be more distinct with no loss of atmosphere. But Burial--a single, scrupulously anonymous guy (although not so scrupulous that anyone suggests he's a woman)--has a sonic imagination worthy of Mr. Tricky himself. Burbling electronic ticktocks vie with a carillon of bell simulacra, and rarely have vinyl crackle or laser malfunction generated more musicality. The moniker and, apparently, the worldview, are dark, as the kids say. But when the mix is as rich as this, dark goes to a better place.

A year into a relationship that began admiring, went on hiatus, and returned passively and then actively pleasurable, this half hour of music now generates something like that satisfied feeling I get when I spend time with, say, Into the Music or Rokku Mi Rokka. Despite the reflexively dark title it shares with the lead track, despite the glitched electronics that will always scare off my generational cohort, despite the consoling females who will just as inevitably trip cynics' corn alarms, its gestalt is intelligently humanistic and fucking uplifting well before the quiet, awkward self-acceptance speech that serves as a coda. The final track goes by ""Come Down to Us."" Good album title, I'd reckon.

Because reggae is long on groove and short on tune, you sometimes wish you could extricate one from the other, which in a way is what this compilation does: combines the four most haunting cuts from a landmark debut with other highlights plus a dab of dub, as much as I and I need. Political and possessed, with Winston Rodney's hypnotic vocals floating, darting, and echoing over the mix, this one's a gift from the mysterious forces of commerce that shouldn't be passed up.

Punk's most incandescent singles band was rarely just catchy or even catchy-abrasive--these guys had a vision. Pete Shelley's wry, acrid, eager, inside-out romanticism connected with every kind of near-adult, and why not?

There's a Cadallaca interview in which Corin Tucker confuses the Ronettes with the Shirelles, and even if it was a ""put-on,"" as young people say, that's all you need know about how much this side project has to do with classic girl groups and the rest of that rot. It's just a song sluice for an irrepressible talent--somewhat gentler and less conflict-purging, with Sarah Dougher's organ replacing Carrie Brownstein's guitar. The one noir period piece is the one misstep; elsewhere they imagine 1942 and dis a booker and invent new romance tropes the way they would in any other band. I love Brownstein. But Tucker could end up eclipsing Polly Jean Harvey herself if that was the way she thought about the world. And one of her strengths is that it isn't.

This is how Island makes up for withholding U.S. release on Helen of Troy, and I think we're better off. As a whole, Helen of Troy is sodden and stylized, and while ""Pablo Picasso"" and ""Leaving It All Up to You"" are Cale at his mad best, ""Mary Lou"" and ""Helen of Troy"" itself almost drag this compilation down. They don't, though. Cale's Island music epitomizes the cold, committed dementia of the best English rock, and side two--comprising ""Fear Is a Man's Best Friend,"" ""Gun,"" ""Dirtyass Rock 'n' Roll,"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel""--is a hard-sell advert for the disease.

Without benefit of a ""Skinheads"" or a ""Bad Trip,"" this is the most convincing of the three very good albums they've dashed off in a year and a half--sixteen tracks, eclectic in a panfolkrock mode that now seems unselfconscious if not inevitable, even the instrumentals equipped with words of one sort of another sometimes. Their stance is bemused when it's not just spaced out, and their ""Interstellar Overdrive"" is too conceptual for my tastes. But I reserve the right to read good politics into the likes of ""Joe Stalin's Cadillac"" (is LBJ's Cadillac is Somoza's Cadillac is General Pinochet's Cadillac is my Cadillac I'd like to drive it off a bridge has anyone seen the bridge). So far their productivity seems proof against the desperate indulgences that can overcome talented bands with dodgy commercial prospects. They're an encouraging aberration in a bad time.

Unfettered after the manner of Kool Moe Dee, uncanny after the manner of Fox Mulder, and uproarious either way, he makes sure his gangsta tropes stay that way because he believes language supercedes reality.

Inspired by the Captain's untoward comeback, I've dug out all his old albums and discovered that as far as I'm concerned this is better than any of them--more daring than Safe as Milk, fuller than Trout Mask Replica, more consistent than Lick My Decals Off, Baby. Without any loss of angularity or thickness, the new compositions achieve a flow worthy of Weill or Monk or Robert Johnson, and his lyrics aren't as willful as they used to be. Bruce Fowler's trombone is especially thaumaturgic adding an appropriately natural color to the electric atonality of the world's funniest ecology crank.

FALSE,A,The Dust Blows Forward: An Anthology,Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=542,"
The proof of his avant-gardism isn't the rejects and weirdness of Grow Fins. It's that the music (if not the poetry) on his finest albums--Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) (1978), Lick My Decals Off, Baby (1970), and Doc at the Radar Station (1980), with the insufficiently fluent Trout Mask Replica (1969) a distinct fifth behind Ice Cream for Crow (1982)--is more gripping and coruscating than ever. But only Trout Mask is in print domestically. And while this double-CD lifts heavily from all while pulling him as far out of shape avantwise (blame Frank Zappa) as popwise (blame Ted Templeman), it also documents, more songfully than he ever cared to, the progress of blues that were progressive to begin with. That's right, blues, no matter what he says, from Skip James and Elmore James to Ornette Coleman and James Blood Ulmer, who Don Van Vliet may never have heard and who should only be so dense and nutty. Another referent: the Band at their careening best. Another: Pavement. Repressive tension, explosive release; sprung rhythm, fugueing melody. All that.

Brooklyn 15-year-old Sophie and her BFF Izzy have had a band since fifth grade and were profiled cute in New York magazine in 2006. They still have plenty of time for premature burnout. But kids can be so gratifying sometimes, and this EP is all about progress. Fountains of Wayne-aided and Donnas-influenced, their mildly enjoyable 2009 full-length was bratty-dreaming-slutty, its assorted putdowns less punk than they thought. Here Sophie permits herself enough introspective vulnerability and messy yearning to tug a dad's heart: ""What I Could Be"" (""You can't understand what it's like being shy"") and ""Ask Me How I Am"" (""Satisfied and OK,"" only she's fronting to be polite). After that she's freed up to bet her probably excessive allowance on a putdown called ""ATM."" She also covers a Marbles song about star dreams I never noticed at CB's and doubt her mom is old enough to have heard in the flesh. The Tears for Fears song she may have.

The Chocolate Drops are an African-American string band from Durham whose first Nonesuch album avoided intimations of minstrelsy but not slavery times, which is when fiddle-banjo-harmonica-bones-kazoo ensembles first entertained both masters and comrades. As was both historically accurate and the thing to do on the folk circuit where they plied their trade, their first Nonesuch album was arresting but contained--soulful and rather slow, America having speeded up considerable since the 19th century. But on this EP they hook up with an NYC Gypsy band whose big moment up to now was one about puttin' the puddin' in the punum, and whoosh, they're off to the camptown races. All four songs are quick, sexy, and a trifle nasty. The first and last celebrate a ""short dress gal"" who walks ""like a queen in the Amazon"" from male and female perspectives, both of which focus on the same end. In between comes a fiddle-fed cover of the gold-digging Blu Cantrell hit ""Hit 'Em Up Style"" and one subtitled ""Diga Diga Diga"" that I say is about speed. Can't parse it further because it's in Roma. That's the 21st-century America I want to live in.

True, existential depression is Toledo's sole subject, without much in the way of romantic travail to universalize it. But on Teens of Denial, Toledo renders that indie-rock ur-theme, um, relatable--grand, rousing, philosophical, ecological, funny, riffy, confused, out front, and of course tuneful. Where once his leads blurred into generalized multitracking, here you can make out his congested, drolly personable, Jonathan Richman-channeling voice. And while to shape his associative structures would betray unseemly firmness of purpose, he milks incantatory repetition like he minored in soukous, extending seven songs past five minutes and three past 7:48: ""Drugs are better with friends are better with drugs are better . . . .,"" say, or the three 12-second ""I give up""s that climax the 11:46 ""Ballad of the Costa Concordia.""

I don't see the point of comparing the most prodigious young jazzman since David Murray if not Ornette to anyone less titanic than Sonny Rollins. He can play anything, with a giant sound on all four saxes plus bass flute and bass clarinet. I greatly enjoy and highly recommend his two blowing sessions for DIW, JC on the Set and Jurassic Classics, with the latter slightly favored for its classic heads--Monk, Ellington, Rollins, Coltrane, Clifford Brown. Still, neither suggests much reason for the playing beyond the playing itself, however sufficient a cause that may be. This romantic set has some concept. Two unfazed Carter originals complement a surprising selection of make-out music by Monk, Ellington, Sun Ra, Bill Doggett, Carter's main man Don Byas. Not only is it more unified, it's more pop, which intensifies the aesthetic charge. And Carter lets Byas's ""1944 Stomp"" rip so fast and hard you'll order up a blowing session immediately.

Say his Wynton Marsalis side provides technique, ambition, maybe focus. Plus, OK, respect for his elders--for sure he's not mocking or upstaging Buddy Tate and Sweets Edison. But it's his Lester Bowie side that inclines him to adore their melodiousness, and their melodies. It's his Bowie side that covers a march by elder Anthony Braxton, consorts with Coltrane via elder Hamiet Bluiett, revs his own waltz into a flag-waver and reduces it to a cartoon. It's his Bowie side that covers the Lester Bowie reggae, defining the grooveful, comic, demotic tone of everything that follows. A jazz album, absolutely.

Never fear--the most gifted and broad-minded young jazzman on the set hasn't succumbed to the dreaded amplifier. Hooking up with Ornette bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, Blood drummer G. Calvin Weston, heavy guitarist Jef Lee Johnson, and fleet guitarist Marc Ribot is just a way for him to make another record without his touring band, write heads while nobody's looking, pay respects to a strain straighter coreligionists disdain, and prove he can rock a little, quite possibly while finishing the crossword. Not that there's anything distracted or desultory about this funk, this blues, this Latin, this harmolodic fusion, this free jazz. But he sure does make them seem second nature.

Although the Carters' selling point is repertoire, their craft is Mother Maybelle's deceptively simple bedrock guitar and vocals that shade matter-of-fact mountain ballad convention. These mostly 1935 recordings are slower and more forceful than the classic 1927-1929 RCAs, substituting audible confidence for sprightly charm and repeating only three tunes from Anchored in Love and My Clinch Mountain Home. If this ""Keep on the Sunny Side"" could be sunnier, that ""Lulu Walls"" could be droller.

As a critic, a surrogate consumer, and a mortal whose four-score and hoping dwindles too quickly as it is, I hate boxes. But once I'd steeled myself for this 75-song monster, I almost downed it in one sitting. Like Bo Diddley, another minimalist who improves with time, Cash gains monumentality as one spare track builds off another toward infinity. Nashville icon though he may be, Cash's Dylan connection no longer seems anomalous--he's certain to be numbered among the century's great folksingers. The tuneless delivery and stark-to-received arrangements always serve the purposes of an artist who puts words first. He's as class-conscious as Woody Guthrie if not Irwin Silber, and if he doesn't prove that Jack Clement and Shel Silverstein are people's composers, which he may, he certainly establishes that John R.

Cash recorded almost as much as Elvis and has been reissued more than God, but this quadruple will satisfy most of us, in part because we can think of things we miss--""Next in Line""! ""Come In Stranger""! ""Singin' in Viet Nam Talking Blues""! ""The Mystery of Life""! We all have our own Johnny Cash, that's one of his strengths, which means we learn a little something from other people's, as in the previously unreleased Billy Joe Shaver duet ""You Can't Beat Jesus Christ."" The box omits the stark Rick Rubin stuff of his old age, which made him a ""legend"" if anything did. But when I test-drove the confusingly titled single-disc The Legend of Johnny Cash, topped off with a few renowned Rubin songs, the sudden dropoff reinforced my reservations about his late-life need to let his charisma stand in for his voice.

Definitely both the grimmest and the most hopeful, which taken together means maybe the best. The big difference is that it's more direct than any of them, keyed to Cash's rewrite of I Corinthians 15:55: ""O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory."" Fortified by his Christian faith, he lends a cracked gravity to souvenirs of cornball sentiment ranging in tone from Ed McCurdy's political ""Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream"" to Queen Lili'uokalani's escapist ""Aloha Oe,"" which close an album that also includes the traditional title song, a Sheryl Crow number about redemption, ""Cool Water,"" and the tenderest ""For the Good Times"" I've ever heard.

An atheist till death takes me home to nowhere, I nonetheless welcome the gospel emphasis here--larger than Kanye's, larger than goddamn Lecrae's--for how it warms Chance's tone of voice and sense of family. The irrepressible cheer of his vocals has always lit up his music. But reaccess Acid Rap and notice how whiny his timbre gets sometimes--charming, always, but immature. Here the death of hisgrandma (who told him he was ""kosher"" why, exactly?) and the birth of his daughter (joint custody not wedlock; too bad) make a man out of him vocally--that adolescent thing is a memory. And the many church singers who pile on mellow melodicism and cultural affirmation broaden his vocal muscle and instill pitch control. His cheer remains irrepressible, and essential.

Fifties groups live on in their voices, not their material. And Arlene Smith's was unbreakable if not immortal. Smith went public at 15, quit the biz of her own accord before she reached 21, and now teaches school in the Bronx, with music on the side. Her Richard Barrett-designed vehicles vary minimally in tempo, arrangement, chord structure--as compositions, they're numbing. But her unaffected outpourings--never cute, never tough, yet right off the street--retain their power and complexity through a shrill remix: she hurts, she yearns, she wonders, but even on ""The Plea"" she never begs or feels sorry for herself. Smith always traced her self-possessed emotionality to Gregorian chant, which is perfect. Clearly God has touched her, yet only the size of her instrument hints at the soul music to come. And not until she moves on, for the last three cuts, can Barrett get the other Chantels to act like a girl group.

Clandestino was warm, sprightly, melancholy, palpably humane. This is all that with magic on top, reprising and varying a small store of infectious tunes into a motley suite segued and differentiated with sound effects, funny voices, surprise guest instruments, and spoken-word samples. The pulse is Marley sans Africa-reggae whiter than the Bellamy Brothers, ska liter than polka. The mood is festive in the urbane, liberal, and internationalist manner of Chao's new home, the pan-European haven Barcelona, a city that resisted Franco so vivaciously for so long that it assumes entertainment coexists with dread.

Of course it overlaps unconscionably with the classic Birth of Soul box, which does the same with the pretty damn good Blues + Jazz double. That's the way Ray planned it. Buy this in remembrance of him.

FALSE,A,Doc Cheatham & Nicholas Payton,Doc Cheatham & Nicholas Payton,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1054,"
Our lesson for today concerns the persistence of culture. Or perhaps the inadequacy of the organic model in matters of style and genre. Or perhaps we should start with the relativity of age. At the time of recording, the session's driving force, trumpeter Payton, was 23. Its star, trumpeter-vocalist Cheatham (now deceased, and not a damn thing relative about that), was 91. One trombonist was barely 40, the other pushing 80. Clarinetist Jack Maheu--next to the trumpeters, the pacesetter here--was almost 70, the others in their fifties. Given his softer embouchure, Cheatham's solos are a little less forthright than Payton's, but both leaders are so immersed in New Orleans style that you rarely register the difference. As rendered here by tourist-circuit revivalists, working scholars, one original, and one pomo phenom, that style isn't dead, decadent, or ironically self-conscious, retaining its spry life and interactive unpredictability even though its revolutionary irreverence is lost to history. Payton keeps his song choices on the novelty side of Tin Pan Alley, where tastemongers are too good to travel unless Berlin or Mercer leads the way, and Cheatham, who only began singing professionally in his late fifties, breathes gentle humor into everything from ""Stardust"" and ""I Gotta Right To Sing the Blues"" to ""Jada"" and ""Save It Pretty Mama."" Somebody tell Neil Young about this. He's not fool enough to try it, and it'll make him feel good.

Not the hits, as Ken Barnes notes defiantly. And about time, as I might say. They never would have written ""Good Times"" without disco hanging around their necks, and then where would we be? But only after they tired of that round did the sparest and smartest of the great funk bands make their move. Believe me, kids, three of their four '80s albums--the grooveful Tongue in Chic, the light-hearted Take It Off, and the serious Real People--are worth scouring the vinyl bins for. But bless Barnes for skimming the cream; I could niggle, but in fact left-field picks like the fancy-schmancy Risquï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿""Will You Cry"" and the acoustic Soup for One fantasia ""Tavern on the Green"" only deepen your astonishment at their intelligence, intensity, sophistication, spirituality, and verve. Oh yes, all that--there's no music like this, including the hits. It just keeps dancing.

The Delfonics and the Moments may have staked first claim on Eugene Record's love man, but Record demolishes the competition, if such a macho concept is permissible in this context (and it certainly is). Not only does he outwrite the other fellas, he doesn't trip over his bassman when the tempo speeds up or make a fool of himself when analyzing the dilemmas of contemporary civilization. The fifteen-song compilation includes the entire first side (plus one) of Give More Power to the People and may actually be too generous--it is possible to OD on this stuff.

I might never have known without the printed lyrics, but there's no evidence here that Martin Phillipps is in love with death. He just sees too much of it. So don't dismiss the printed Greenpeace propaganda as gratuitous--for the Chills it's an antidote. What distinguishes them from so many politically well-meaning popsters is that neither cheery music nor dour message is one-dimensional or pro forma--they generate plenty of punk gall and a surprising complement of bliss. Maybe ""Heavenly Pop Hit"" is about waking up as an angel, but I say Phillipps believes there can be a heaven before he's dead, and if his vision of transcendence is a bit nature-bound for my tastes, it's the thought that counts. Anyway, his true theme song is ""Singing in My Sleep,"" about all the other theme songs--""a word from the wise for the mindless,"" ""a stinging reproach against violence,"" etc.--that he can't remember in the morning.

By opening the first side with ""Motherless Children"" and closing it with ""I Shot the Sheriff,"" Clapton puts the rural repose of his laid-back-with-Leon music into a context of deprivation and conflict, adding bite to soft-spoken professions of need and faith that might otherwise smell faintly of the most rural of laid-back commodities, bullshit. And his honesty has its reward: better sex. The casual assurance you can hear now in his singing goes with the hip-twitching syncopation he brings to Robert Johnson's ""Steady Rolling Man"" and Elmore James's ""I Can't Hold Out,"" and though the covers are what make this record memorable it's on ""Get Ready,"" written and sung with Yvonne Elliman, that his voice takes on a mellow, seductive intimacy he's never come close to before.

FALSE,A,Give 'Em Enough Rope,The Clash,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3539,"
Although in the end I find that Sandy Pearlman's production does as much justice to the power of this band as the debut does to their rough intensity, I know why some are disappointed. The band's recent strategy has been to cram their dense, hard sound so full of growls and licks and offhand remarks that it never stops exploding. Here that approach occasionally seems overworked, and so does the vision--this major (and privileged) pop group sounds as wearied by the failure of punk solidarity, the persistence of racial conflict, the facelessness of violence, and the ineluctability of capital as a bunch of tenured Marxists. But these familiar contradictions follow upon the invigorating gutter truths of the first album for a reason--they're truths as well, truths that couldn't be stated more forcefully with any other music. Great exception: ""Stay Free,"" Mick Jones's greeting to a mate fresh out of jail that translates the band's new political wariness into personal warmth.

Cut for cut, this may be the greatest rock and roll album (plus limited-edition bonus single) ever manufactured in the U.S. It offers ten of the fourteen titles on the band's British debut as well as seven of the thirteen available only on forty-five. And the sequencing is anything but haphazard; the eight songs on side one divide into self-contained pairs that function as extended oxymorons on careerism, corporate power, race, and anomie. Yet the package feels misbegotten. The U.K. version of The Clash is the greatest rock and roll album ever manufactured anywhere partly because its innocence is of a piece--it never stops snarling, it's always threatening to blow up in your face. I'm still mad the real thing wasn't released two years ago, and I know for certain (I made a tape) that the singles would have made a dandy album by themselves. Nevertheless, a great introduction and a hell of a bargain.

The soundtrack to the greatest rock and roll movie this side of The TAMI Show is the greatest rock and roll compilation this side of 18 King Size Rhythm and Blues Hits. Only it's better, because directory Perry Henzell had five years of reggae to choose from, with no real label restrictions. Reggae isn't straight rock and roll, of course--its syncopation was a response to the rock that replaced shuffle r&amp;b on U.S. radio in the early '60s. But the interplay of amped-up bass, heartbeat drums, and scratch guitar is as good a rhythm as anyone else's out right now, and though there are only two million Jamaicans, at least 50,000 of them want to be reggae stars. Among the eight who make it here are movie hero Jimmy Cliff (defiant, plaintive, inspirational) and prime minister of soul Toots Hibbert (exuberant, pressured, amused), but wonderful minor artists like the Slickers (whose ""Johnny Too Bad"" is a rough draft of the movie) and Scotty (whose song is a chant) are just as representative of this thriving, disorganized scene. Docked a notch for repeating two Cliff songs.

Nothing on this mature work of art will tear the roof off any mothersucker--Dr. Funkenstein's earthshaking jams are past. But that's hardly to suggest that he's lost his sense of rhythm or hermeneutics. In other words, if your ears say you've heard some of these grooves before, don't tell your ass about it and your mind'll never be the wiser. Clinton has deepened in the wake of his failure to turn the planet upside-down, and this is his most flawless album, paced and orchestrated without a dead spot and thought through like a mothersucker. Even the earthshaking jams of the past are accounted for, and in two or three different ways. Man's best friend spelled backwards is? And why would anyone want to spell it backwards?

Side one leads off with his version of The African King and quickly proves his most irresistible since Motor-Booty Affair, with ""Quickie"" a riff/groove that gleams like ""Flash Light"" and ""Last Dance"" a big fat fart in David Bowie's face. Even the talkover filler on the title track is worth listening to, and Philippe Wynne's lowdown oinks make ""Stingy"" a worthy heir to none other than the Coasters' ""I'm a Hog for You.""

A remix album, not a best-of, and one that avoids the promotional overkill and commercial double jeopardy of its half-assed demigenre. The live track, the previously unreleased, the remakes from the unnoteworthy R&amp;B Skeletons and the unnoticed Jimmy G., the woofing bookends, the recycled P-Funk classics--all are renewed and of a piece. One secret weapon is youngbloods who owe him, including the Miss America he saved from the bluenoses and a typically nonjudgmental range of excellent rappers--Ice Cube and Q-Tip, Coolio and Busta Rhymes, Humpty Hump and Ol' Dirty Bastard. Another is Clinton's perpetually renewable tracks, which are always of a piece.

The Goduncle hasn't made a bad record since the band broke up or an exciting one since Computer Games. Until now. Don't try this at home, kids, but the secret is that instead of adapting to youthcult fashion, a trick he manages like no other fiftysomething can, he indulges an idï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½""I-O"") in contraband--meaning weapons, ultimately, but more enjoyable threats to human life first. So he starts by assuming dogs sniff dope because they gotta have it and takes off. Just about every song has both dogs and dope in it, with variations as comical as Mr. Wiggles the Worm and considerably darker. The funk is long on guitar and capable of anything. Is that bebop? You know, behind the elementary-school rappers and the pill-popping poodle?

The rapping is crystalline, gritty--that is, hard two ways. The only reason ""Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious"" isn't the theme is that they're not sorry. Playing hit rappers forced by evil bizzers to return to a life of crime, so that music is just pocket money for them, they're unflinchingly unsensationalistic. But it's the beats that turn this into noir worthy of Jim Thompson, far from the stolen fun of the We Got It for Cheap mixtapes. Anyone who associates the Neptunes with suave keyboard hooks won't believe they're behind all this spare alienation. So what if ""Mr. Me Too"" contains a portion of the composition ""Burrup,"" written by Cegricia Hamilton and Gary Henderson? Meaning that buzzing dub thing? Or is it ringing? OK, vibrating.

Yet the puns that are lost in translations-provided aren't missed, because Henry is also a master of the same Cuban guitar style that spawned Zairian rumba in the '50s. By the time these tracks were recorded circa 1980, his large, simple band--three male singers, three guitarists, three percussionists, bass, drums--had perfected a beguiling lilt free of Kinshasa's far-off fashion wars.

Fans of Louis Jordan and the Ink Spots inventing a dirty doowop that didn't come naturally, the Clovers were funnier, raunchier, and suaver than their r&amp;b predecessors the Orioles and the Ravens, hitting their stride several years before r&amp;b turned teen music in 1955. With help from in-house sophisticates Ahmet Ertegun, Jesse Stone, and Rudolph Toombs, they made their Alan Freed move with ""Devil or Angel"" in early 1956, and when I was 13 I thought it sounded peachy. In fact, it did sound peachy. And up against the doggish ""Little Mama,"" the bibulous ""Nip Sip,"" and the Freudian ""Your Cash Ain't Nothin' but Trash,"" its innocence is patently insincere.

Nothing's perfect, and most of his albums are worth purchasing separately, but at least this double CD picks all the indelibles off the supple 1968 Songs of Leonard Cohen, and half of them off the stark 2001 Ten New Songs. Also, true peace-on-earthers will appreciate the depressive gesture, as well as a seasonal party game: a Bush-era rewrite of the cultural-revolutionary threnody ""First We Take Manhattan."" Take it from: ""They sentenced me to 30 days of rehab/For trying to have my coke and eat it too/I'll show those pricks the silver spoon that we have/First we take the statehouse, then we take D.C.""

FALSE,A,Live in London,Leonard Cohen,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14551,"
What a strange and inspiring story. Cohen had reached a state of permanent equilibrium by the year 2000, a revered cult artist in his late sixties with a multimillion-dollar catalogue and a mild case of agoraphobia. Musically he remained fairly productive, but detached, as befitted a Zen priest. Only then his longtime manager sold his publishing out from under his nose and absconded with the proceeds, and at 70 he found himself down to his last 150 grand. So in early 2008, aged 73, he launched a money-making world tour that has continued ever since. Offered a ticket by a friend, I walked in a fond skeptic and walked out a convert. The miraculous show I witnessed, where Cohen literally skipped on and off stage, lasted even longer than this two-and-a-half-hour double-CD, which will now be my Cohen of choice even though its songs are pretty much duplicated on the excellent Essential Leonard Cohen. The band is on it, the backup singers are solicitous, and Cohen's husk of a voice has been juiced up by the exercise. But the difference isn't the performances per se. It's the audience interactions. Gracious to a fault, Cohen is no longer detached. As practiced as his profuse thank yous are, his gratitude for the adoration of his cult is palpable not just in his stage talk but in the warmth and good humor with which he celebrates an oeuvre that no longer makes him a dime. Though I'd say it's less, Hank Williams may still be a hundred floors above him in the tower of song. But Cohen is no longer wondering how lonely things can get.

Some may have hoped the greatest saxophone player alive would go the Weather Report route on his first small-group record since 1971, but I'm reminded more of the programmed synthesizers of Eno and Philip Glass. Basically, the record consists of charged repetitions of one motif from Coleman's symphony, Skies of America. The difference is that where most such music aims for a hypnotic effect, Coleman wants more: a sustained and formally satisfying version of the kind of galvanic intensity John McLaughlin used to create at climatic moments. He gets it, too.

Packed by their eternal leader into ten cuts averaging 3:22, Cherry-Haden-Higgins surge hotter at fifty than they ever dreamed old or new, as if harmolodic funk is an essentially structural principle, inhering more in the constraints of song conception that in the electric pulse. It's the Quartet disc that evokes the dense flow of Of Human Feelings, which leaves Prime Time room for patches of free cacophony as daunting as the Quartet in its youth. Defining both bands is the natural iconoclasm and indefatigable lyricism of the fifty-seven-year-old rebel who's probably the most widely respected musician in the world, and who somehow doesn't get any less amazing as a result.

Looking back, we understand that Coleman was always an inspired melodist. We may even conclude that it was his melodies that made his free, harmolodic and avant-funk concepts irresistible. But at 76, he turns the page with this two-bass, two-Coleman quartet. Tony Falanga bows most ballad themes and is hornlike or maybe just cellolike throughout. Ornette's alto (though not his trumpet or violin) could also be described as cellolike, and his new compositions suit the mellow mood even when the arrangement gives Denardo Coleman room to bash and rumble. Exemplary is one of just two remakes: 1959's ""Turnaround,"" which was a lowdown gutbucket blues on Tomorrow Is the Question but is a whimsical chamber-music blues here. Both times Ornette quotes Cole Porter's ""Do I Love You""; here he also quotes Stephen Foster's ""Beautiful Dreamer."" Conceptually as major as Change of the Century (1959) or Of Human Feelings (1979) and almost as consummately executed.

An orphan in Coleman's many-labeled catalogue, this 1970 recording is often overlooked in favor of his somewhat earlier live-in-Stockholm Golden Circle albums on Blue Note, a more reputable imprint than Bob Thiele's Flying Dutchman. It had sat unplayed amid my vinyl for 40 years. But when I gave this Eurozone-manufactured CD a trial spin, I fell hard. The Golden Circle records have great moments (the lyrical ""Antiques,"" the site-specific ""Faces and Places""). But they're chamber music. This has the overheard quality of a jam, with Coleman's time-tested Charlie Haden-Ed Blackwell rhythm section beefed up by Dewey Redman, whose tenor is always there to add some body when Ornette picks up a trumpet or violin. Cacophonous title track to theme-and-variations ""Long Time No See"" to trumpet feature ""Let's Play"" to two-sax ""Forgotten Songs"" to blowout ""Tomorrow,"" it's all keyed by a very multigenerational chorus singing or if necessary chanting ""Friends and neighbors, that's where it's at.""

The pulse pulses, and Jerry Garcia, never exactly King Kickass, fits right in. The tuneful themes show off Ornette's pop feel, and while Garcia has rarely comped or noodled more purposefully, it's the unsung Charlee Ellerbee or the equally unsung Bern Nix who does the tighten-up beneath ""Bourgeois Boogie."" In and around the themes Ornette improvises a whole lot of saxophone without once showing off. He's beyond that now.

Although it helps that she's a college-educated art damagee herself, it helps even more that her bootlegger-turned-welder dad was in a band with her mom. Cook has been perfecting her craft long enough to recognize that her mama's funeral and her heroin addict sister are the stuff of art--those are both exact titles, but capitals and quotation marks would reduce them to mere songs rather than experiences the non-irony-damaged can share. And she's been living her life long enough that she won't let her suffering, to call it by its rightful name, dampen her appetite for good times.

What's so disarming, and confusing, about Tjinder Singh is that he doesn't have a lot to say. Here he is realizing a historical inevitability a decade or three in the making--namely, an international pop so seamless that its fusion of Anglo-American alt-rock, Indian melody, international hip hop, and what-all is subsumed into its own song-based catchiness right up to the time Singh reclaims ""Norwegian Wood"" for the land of the sitar. And indeed, his lyrics vaguely express the proper liberal attitudes toward the weighty social issues his achievement implies. But there's no sense of mission, just a handsome dilettante enjoying his easy tunes and found beats; he's not even trying to go pop, especially.

There are even fewer true songs here than on the breakthrough album he dropped five years ago now, and like Manu Chao he favors the reprise. But I love his commonsense grooves--the Memphis bottom and cheesy keyb for honorary compere Otis Clay, the guitar vamp on ""Lessons Learned From Rocky I to Rocky III"" matching the B-3 on ""Wogs Will Walk.""

Dennis Coulson knows Dylan's lyrics for the lazy, flirtatious embraces of perception they are, and so never sops over into literalness--Baezesque prettifying or Bandesque uglifying. And where American folk-rockers can be counted on for the just-so flourish, the swelling rhythm, these guys (aided by producer Manfred Mann, world's most sensible Dylan nut) keep it ragged--the music rocks and rolls, but it also seems to stop short every now and then, and it's catchy, hooking with a tabla here, a build arrangement there, clownish horns that signify an entire side. Cynical (""Open the Door Homer"") and idealistic (""The Death of Emmett Till""), self-pitying (""Sign on the Cross"") and self-reliant (""Let Me Die in My Footsteps""), but always tough and intelligent.

But the Coup are pure Oakland, a cross between Too Short, whose deep-bumping beats presaged a live-in-the-studio funk that would have sounded old school when the Bomb Squad was def, and David Hilliard, the Panther whose autobiography tops a reading list that also recommends Manning Marable and Saul Alinsky. Boots Riley's tour de force, which climaxes by flipping a surprisingly street Microsoft-Macintosh metaphor, is a corny, well-plotted tale where a 24-year-old kills the pimp and surrogate father who long ago murdered his mom. But every track impresses, including the music-as-dope opener, the revolutionary call to arms, the brutal medical expose (""It seems that he's lost the will to pay""), the repo-man burlesque, funny stories about sneaking into the movies and driving broken-down hoopties, and ""Underdogs,"" which translates Manning Marable into terms any ghetto struggler can recognize.

The title's a pun, too, signifying Black Panther or Communist (or necktie), only not only, because the tracks blow up: The live band, the male and female choruses, and DJ Pam the Funkstress do here commit a positive groove worthy of Frankie Beverly, Digital Underground, Chuck Brown. Similarly, the slogans-to-go that begin with the first verse--""Every death is an abrupt one/Every cop is a corrupt one/Without no cash up in a trust fund/Every cat with a gat wants to bust one/Every guest wants a plus-one""--are underpinned by songs wise beyond anybody's years, such as the woman-friendly tale of the girl who convinced a fumbling 17-year-old Boots that he'd fathered her child. Imperfect, definitely. But only because perfection is on the table.

Boots Riley's live-in-the-studio funk is as retro as his Afro, and when Talib Kweli percusses next to him you'd think his flow was straight out the Watts Prophets. So call him corny if his Marxist talk makes you nervous. Fact is, the brother's some writer, with his own Oaktown sound. Marxism fans should start with the two love songs: ""Ijustwannalayaroundalldayinbedwithyou"" lays out the rationalization of the capitalist workday, while the Silk E. feature ""BabyLet'sHaveABabyBeforeBushDoSomethin'Crazy"" speaks for itself. Plus the Chomskyite ""Head (of State)"" also has sex in it, the sponsored ""Ass-Breath Killers"" will help cure your bootymouth, and ""I Love Boosters!"" is merely the warmest of many shout-outs to a criminal community he's too busy to join. Riley understands as well as any songwriter in America how the black poor and other barely employeds get by, and he also understands who's taking their money, and how. His lesser songs would be dookie gold on an ordinary undie-rap album. And he's no moralizer: ""I'm here to laugh, love, fuck, and drink liquor/And help the damn revolution come quicker.""

A lover of rock and roll, not rock, John Fogerty serves up his progress in modest and reliable doses. The songwriting's not as inspired as on Willy and the Poorboys--no hidden treasures like ""Don't Look Now"" or ""It Came Out of the Sky."" But the sound is fuller, the band more coherent, Fogerty's singing more subtle and assured, so that a straightforward choogle like ""Ramble Tamble"" holds up simply as music for seven minutes. The same goes for the most ordinary three-minute job here--finally, none of them are ordinary. The triumphs are ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine,"" which consummates ""Suzie Q""'s artless concept of rock improvisation, and ""Lookin' Out My Back Door,"" in which Fogerty abandons his gritty timbre--so obviously an affectation, yet so natural-seeming--for a near-tenor that sweetly synthesizes spirituality and whimsy.

This album seems simple because it is simple, yet it continues to unfold long after you believe its byways played out--not by exploiting the snazzy bridges and key changes of the traditional pop arsenal, but with lines repeated at odd junctures, choruses reentering when you anticipate another verse. Brushing by the everyday phrases that are the stuff of pop songwriting--cynical girl, she can't dance, the usual thing--to add a twist or make an oblique point, Crenshaw captures a magic ur-adolescent innocence without acting the simp. It's as sly and well-meaning as his love of girls.

FALSE,A,The Best of Bing Crosby: The Millenium Collection,Bing Crosby,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=322,"
Crosby perfected modern microphone technique and pioneered the musical use of magnetic tape. He was hip to the jive at a time when declaring yourself a Rhythm Boy was rebellion aplenty. But it's hard to hear these innovations in his countless records, partly because they've been superseded, partly because the essence of his art was an illusion of naturalness that fails if people notice it. So I've never found a record of his to get with until this 12-track cheapo, which features another Crosby--the one some count the most popular recording artist of the 20th century. The only title under-30s know here is ""White Christmas."" But for a child of the prerock era like me, these songs are pop music--not the well-bred harmonic pretensions pumped by Alec Wilder, but the Tin Pan Alley whose model is the Irving Berlin of ""Play a Simple Melody."" This was easy, sentimental music; my family sang ""Dear Hearts and Gentle People"" at parties, and I knew the words to ""Swinging on a Star"" by age four. But if to me it sounds like a social fact, to someone younger it's the indelible trace of a culture now lost. And it's Crosby who transforms it into a given.

Three years late, I downed Gary Giddins's biography, and thus armed found it easy enough to access these 50 songs. Giddins rewrites history to make room for Crosby, an aggressively pan-ethnic everyman with a Jesuit education and a wild-oats past who had the confidence and the sense of rhythm to put his big voice to modest uses--and dominate our mass culture, movies and music both, for longer than FDR was president. Urged to be all things to all Americans by Decca's Jack Kapp, he avoided the fancy songs beboppers would soon sing changes on and the ambitious arrangers who started Frank Sinatra on the road to Art. But he never condescended to his tunes, and he picked good ones. Credit his decency and intelligence and you can comprehend the attractions of an American dream that deserves better than the exploitation to which it's still subjected by ruling-class cynics he would have seen through in a minute.

Then they construct an album-not-mixtape around the theme of money, including the capital they accrued as they pursued their dreams. ""Come to our shows and they're clapping again/Thank you my friends"" isn't sarcastic, which doesn't mean it's devoid of irony or should be. ""There's a brand new dance/Give us all your money/Everybody love everybody"" is sarcastic. ""Michael Jackson/A million dollars"" is meta. ""I ain't backing out till I own a bank to brag about"" is protest. ""I'm at the White Castle""/""I don't see you here dog"" is follow-up. ""Your booty is a lifeline"" is a religious interlude.

This is the most commonly disparaged of Davis's many '70s double-LPs--it's said that Davis was so unhappy with his own playing that he abandoned the release to Teo Macero half-way through. But Miles isn't the hero here--he gives the album to the band, whose virtuosity is the ground of four apparently unstructured segments. Mtume, Reggie Lucas, and especially Michael Henderson provide the variable pulse, with drummer Al Foster moving from body to spirit rhythms in an effortless, guileless show of chops. Sonny Fortune triples on alto, soprano, and flute in the best reed playing on a Davis record in this decade. And guitarist Pete Cosey is simply astonishing--the noises he produces for the second half of side one comprise some of the greatest free improvisations ever heard in a ""jazz""-""rock"" context. Angry, dissociated, funky, and the best Davis music since Jack Johnson.

The guru-manipulator shifted gears at will in his early-'70s music, orchestrating moods and settings to subjugate the individual musical inspirations of his young close-enough-for-funk subgeniuses to the life of a single palpitating organism that would have perished without them--no arrangements, little composition, and not many solos either, although at any moment a player could find himself left to fly off on his own. Harsher and dreamier than In Concert, louder and sweeter than Agharta or Pangaea, this well-tweaked 1974 concert culminates the aesthetic. Where pure funk subsumes jazz and rock in a new conception, albeit one that privileges rock, Miles leaves the two elements distinct and recognizable. Dave Liebman is good for wild-to-mellow jazz input that's solidified by a Coltranesque house call from Azar Lawrence, and for rock there are three guitarists: Reggie Lucas and Dominique Gaumont wah-riffing the rhythm as Chess session man turned cult hero Pete Cosey launches wah-wah-inflected noise into the arena-rock stratosphere. The beat belongs jointly to Michael Henderson and Al Foster. And Miles is Miles whether blasting out clarion notes or letting his Yamaha drench the scene.

Tapes of these Bill Laswell remixes have been around almost a year, and for the longest time I didn't get the point. When the original albums were edited down for release by Teo Macero, that was Davis's choice; alive, he was free to object should Macero's forays into formlessness strike him as too discursive, or too commercial. Anyway, learning to distinguish among the author-authorized variants was tricky enough. Hand them over to the ambient-techno brigade and the tide would never stop rising. But one night I listened with a first timer and got the message. Metastructures condensed, themes highlighted, beats punched up by a master tinkerer who's loved them forever, the transcendent buzz of electric Miles nevertheless remains undulant, unpredictable, perverse--and so relaxed about getting where it's not actually going that newcomers will find it hard to imagine how much more unhurriedly it might arrive. For me this will get played like In a Silent Way and Jack Johnson before it. It's a passport to provisional utopia.

Although in theory I like my makeout music instrumental--who needs a peanut gallery?--in fact I prefer undistracted silence. But I'll happily make an exception for the consensual intimacy summoned by Miles's quiet cool and taciturn affection for the limits of the melody at hand. Unless you can't keep your ears off Someday My Prince Will Come, which gives up three of nine cuts, this definitely won't kill the mood.

First of the CD-ROMs she started peddling at gigs in early 2000, first officially released. Though her subsequent output includes stories so fantastic they could kick off an attack of the Dylans, if there's a song you don't need here it's only by comparison. Right, it won't convert the insulin-challenged, and what can she do? Among other things--her desire to hit a certain social worker with a crowbar, for instance--Dawson has a genuinely sweet nature and a fondness for every kind of play including word. Like fellow (ex-?) Moldy Peach Adam Green, she's super clever, but in addition she's got loads of heart--heart that would look great on her sleeve if she had a sleeve, which she doesn't because she's so naked. Coextensive with the nursery-rhyme whisper and goofy-catchy toy samples is someone you want to know--mature, childlike, full of fun, and conversant with species of misery growing girls should only grow up without. Any album that leaves you wondering whether there's really a Muhammad Ali Barbie will enrich your life in ways you can't now imagine.

Not that they're nearly as neat--there's distortion everywhere, vocalsguitarskeyboardsnotessounds.

Bonnie was the songwriter and the terrific singer, Delaney the bandleader and the real good singer. Theirs was a marriage made on Sunset Strip, where two Southerners' displaced rural conservatism met the counterculture's exaltation of earthtone authenticity in an image of hippie adulthood that lasted till the divorce was underway in 1972 (shortly after they agreed to dispense with Bonnie's live-in lover on the unbelievably tender ""Move 'Em Out""). Their conjugal sturm-und-drang was ""a natural fact,"" the most canny and heartfelt and effortless rock-soul fusion in history. Their solo careers were a depressing embarrassment.

But though I suppose I'd prefer it if they hadn't recorded a few of the selections before, the country blues side is a seamless delight, the most unflawed listening music I've heard in a long while.

(Whaddaya mean, who's he? That Ian Nieman.) The median number of songwriters on these 11 tracks is five, and almost every one of the 11 keeps the addictive promise of ""Ridin' Solo."" Balkan Beat Box funks up the booty-owning ingenue whose opening bid is a sweet ""Jason! Hee-hee-hee!"" Snoop confides to the next booty proprietor, ""Damn, baby, you got a bright future behind you."" Timbaland induces his assigned booty to pop like bubblegum. And the tush twerks on for 38 minutes. But it's Derulo whose ebullience convinces me that he's dealing confidence not arrogance, pleasure not power.

Less ironic, and funnier, than the originals, so that titles like ""Emotion"" and ""No Dough"" mean what they say, they're rock-is-lifers--not immune to sexism, with all the usual retrograde attitudes.

The title's about escaping oppression and mortality, fleeing social madness and physical contingency into a spiritual realm of your own, and I say they get away clean. As the Godfather taught and the Planets agree--on ""Escape-Ism"" and ""Escapism (Gettin' Free),"" respectively--all music is escapist one way or another, a symbolic/sensual refuge no matter how cerebral, demanding, or hard to take. The test is the alternate reality it creates, and by exploiting the solid tunes and light feel of jazz from Sonny Rollins to Lonnie Liston Smith, these hip hop bohemians come up with a credible one. The airy delicacy of their sampled groove seems magically hyperreal in this pop context, transforming Butterfly and Doodlebug's weakness into wit and Ladybug's sambalike skippity-skip into a come-on that's equal parts sexuality and self-respect. The specific ""Pacifics,"" about Sunday in New York, respects the literal here-and-now more observantly than any number of gat-filled street whoppers, and ""La Femme Fï¿½ï¿½"" about Butterfly's conversation with a female friend, is the most humane, didactic, and politically informed prochoice song ever recorded.

Mac Rebennack was a studio musician for a full decade before launching his Night Tripper hustle, and that doesn't count the two years he spent in stir. Then and later, monkey perched perpetually on his back, he wrote a whole lot of songs, and too many of them are hackwork. Even on the two-CD Mos' Scocious the writing becomes a problem. But with one or two exceptions, this CD never lets up, epitomizing his biz-wise mastery of rhumba boogie and the second line. The two pop hits lead. The gris-gris tracks are songs not shtick. The three selections from Gumbo don't come near to exhausting it--couldn't expect him to pass up the wickedest ""Junko Partner"" ever recorded or the touchstone ""Tipitina,"" which re-emerges in his whiskey-piano dash through Joe Liggins's ""Honeydripper.""

Dolphy shared John Coltrane's taste for the ecstatic without ever abandoning bebop-style, European-harmony-based cogitation.

A year later, he left his mark on me at the Village Gate, Labor Day '62 I think it was, when he encored with Coltrane--on alto? bass clarinet? surely not flute--and blew my head off. In a sense I've been trying to return to that night ever since, but though I've gotten close a few times, it was never via Dolphy (in fact, never via jazz). I dug the box, hell yeah.

Except maybe for Fats Domino himself, Dorsey stands as the drollest and most durable of the New Orleans rock and roll singers. His lean, lilting, unflappably jaunty high baritone carries subtle emotional weight; exploiting flexibility rather than power, it counter-punches expertly against Allen Toussaint's elliptical comping and Ziggy Modeliste's rat-a-tat-tat (a-tat-tat). Dorsey never made a bad album (you should hear ""Mexico"" on his 1966 Amy hits-plus-filler entry), and Charly's UK compilation turns up many memorable obscurities. But I know damn well that this is the Dorsey record I'll be playing now. From ""Ya-Ya"" and ""Do-Re-Mi"" for Fury in 1961 to ""Yes We Can"" and ""Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley"" for Polydor in 1970, with eight Amy singles in between, it picks out all the obvious stuff and makes you love it.

Sure you'll still hum ""Working in the Coal Mine"" and ""Get Out of My Life Woman,"" obscurities like ""Can You Hear Me"" and ""Gotta Find a Job"" too. But Dorsey's slippery pitch and lackadaisical phrasing add different-flavor funk and whimsy to concoctions that aim for both. And when the Meters come on, backing the very obscure ""Lottie Mo '68"" after Dorsey's best-remembered days at Amy are over, the singer again adds his own dynamics--counterpunching like Kid Chocolate, he's as much a percussion instrument as JB, only funnier.

Contract  singers hired out to contract producers, the post-1958 Drifters were pop product as perfect as Abba or the Archies: where some cite Ben E. King's ""There Goes My Baby"" as primal soul music, I say Leiber &amp; Stoller's ""There Goes My Baby"" was the first true rock and roll record with violins on it. Here the product is reduced to 16 songs in 41 minutes--roofs and boardwalks, last dances and numbered tears, this magic moment and some kind of wonderful. Deprived of such professionalism, beach music would be immeasurably poorer.

OK, 19 songs, gotta be filler here somewhere, and there is, only it isn't melodic--with all music credited to the band, Shonna Tucker's muzzier lyrics and Mike Cooley's more elusive ones sound as well-turned as those of Patterson Hood, who's never written better. In Hood's songs, an opening act, an alcoholic, a crankhead, a heroic suicide, a heroic survivor and two different soldiers in Iraq fall between an opener where heaven is Saturday morning with your wife and kids and a closer that contemplates ""the ironic nature of history."" Cooley remains the lowlife specialist, most warmly with lost party girl Lisa and hometown gay guy Bob. Some complain ""Bob"" is the corniest country song they ever wrote. That's the point--one of several.

Mike Cooley has always been a more facile singer and tunesmith than Patterson Hood. But facile implies that things come easy for him, and Cooley has never written enough to sustain that illusion until this album, where the leaders of the world's smartest boogie band split thirteen tracks smack down the middle. Two hymns to a caring fatalism bookend pained descriptions of simple men who believe clever bumper stickers and the piece of shit they vote for, of marriages too tragic for cheating songs because their ends are not in sight: the relaxed, acerbic Cooley lead ""Shit Shots Count"" (""The boss ain't as smart as you'd like him to be/But he ain't near as dumb as you think"") and the pained, oncycling Hood elegy ""Grand Canyon"" (""I'm never one to wonder about the things beyond control""). But pervading it all is a musical ease that's on Cooley--a groove and feel that accomplishes a provisional and uncomplacent peace for a band eternally grateful that the highway still rolls.

In part because the Hood-to-Cooley ratio is back up and in part because they're less relaxed as the Obama Age ends, this superb song collection is raggedier than the last superb song collection. But in recompense it's more explicit and bereaved. Having resettled in Oregon just in time to detail an Umpqua massacre preceded by a victim's nice morning and idyllic weekend, Hood also spends 6:27 in Ferguson and its branches nationwide. Cooley opens with ""Ramon Casiano,"" which minimal Googling makes clear is an assault on the NRA, and soon follows with ""Surrender Under Protest,"" about the actual outcome of that war the starry-eyed say ended at Appomattox. Then there's the finale that begins ""I was listening to the radio when they said that you were gone."" Gotta be Merle, right? Uh-uh--Robin Williams. It's about mood swings and depression out of control, a somatic heritage Hood tells us he knows firsthand.

Dury has had great taste in musicians since pub-rock, and he's bent to dance-music convention without betraying sweet Gene Vincent. But this compilation of singles proves quite definitively that his genius is for lyrics.

What's more, he has something to say--his slightly salacious humanism is the perfect match for his diction.

They ain't as good, though, and if they're why Demon reprogrammed a perfect record, it is to weep. I even prefer the earlier title--if a change was required, give me Reasons To Be Cheerful, not a slogan more misused than born-in-the-U.S.A.

More than I can catalogue recycle ""Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll,"" ""Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick,"" and a bunch of lesser-known songs that are better than either. But though the mastering could be brighter on this elderly 18-tracker, there are plenty of them around used and its selection is clearly superior to that of the closest competitor I've found, Great American Music's stupidly entitled 2007 The Best of Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll. The only hands-down masterpieces the Rhino lacks from that one are ""My Old Man"" and the late ""Bill Haley's Last Words,"" and it adds four others, including ""You're More Than Fair,"" which is surely the only great song to include both the word ""clitoris"" and the word ""toilet"" and probably the finest to include either. Tender or crass, loud or quiet, loungy or recitative, cheerleader for his world-class idols or adept of local accents I know nothing more about, he was music-hall's great inheritor.

Yet another self-portrait. With all of Dylan's overexposed stuff relegated to Volume I, it unlooses one indubitable classic after another, and because it spans a decade without pretending to (or bothering with) thematic/stylistic coherence, the only overall impression it creates is a staggering, unpredictable virtuosity. Mixed into the star persona are protest (""Hard Rain"") and antiprotest (""My Back Pages""), callow ass man (""All I Really Want to Do"") and manly ass man (""Lay Lady Lay""). And just in case you think you already own it all, five of the twenty-two cuts are previously uncollected or unreleased. Three of them have been established as indubitable classics by other artists, and the other two begin and end the album.

At its best, this is the craziest and strongest rock and roll ever recorded. All analogous live albums fall flat. The Rolling Stones are mechanical dolls by comparison, the Faces merely sloppy, the Dead positively quiet. The MC5 achieved something similar by ignoring musicianship altogether, but while the Band sounds undisciplined, threatening to destroy their headlong momentum by throwing out one foot or elbow too many, they never abandon their enormous technical ability. In this they follow the boss. When he sounded thin on Planet Waves, so did they. Now his voice settles in at a rich bellow, running over his old songs like a truck. I agree that a few of them will never walk again, but I treasure the sacrilege; Uncle Bob purveying to the sports arena masses. We may never even know whether this is a masterpiece.

Although it doesn't approach RCA's long-lost Flaming Youth and touches fewer famous classics than Columbia's fainter, cleaner two-CD Okeh Ellington, this warm, scratchy disc leads out of his tangled discography into his '20s music, which traffics in a rinky-dink novelty more rock and roll than his glossy big-band dance charts. At first only a few familiar tunes stand out from the delicate audacity and raucous detail of the sound. But soon every theme kicks in, every silky clarinet solo and bumptious plunger mute. Ellington called this jungle music because white folks would never have believed he heard the modern city so much better than they did. They learned, kind of.

For hooks she calls in more platinum guests than the entire genre supported in 1990 and cites aphorisms that embody history if you know your Salt-N-Pepa and embody fresh if you don't.

You know all that brouhaha about Texas music? Here's a record that bears it out for more than two songs at a time. Ely's emotional openness seems neither sentimental nor contrived. He balls the jack with irrefutable glee and sings the lonesome ones so high and hard he makes the next room sound 500 miles away. With Butch Hancock sharing the writing, there are maybe two less-than-memorable songs on the entire album. There's great (Lousiana?) accordion, apt (Mexican?) horns, and lots of (Lubbock!) rock and roll. In short, there hasn't been anything like this since Gram Parsons was around to make Grievous Angel, or do I mean Gilded Palace of Sin?

You want to feel how fluently Hancock rolls out narrative metaphor, compare Ely's ""Honky Tonk Masquerade""--title song of his second and best album, a well-turned set piece as good as said title and no more--to ""Boxcars"": ""Well there's some big old Buicks by the Baptist church/Cadillacs at the Church of Christ/I parked my camel by an old haystack/I'll be looking for that needle all night."" Some believe you can get all the ex-Flatlanders you need from Ely's first two albums, now available on a single convenient CD. But the 13 later tracks here complete a far stronger package, leaning hard on Ely's less poetic songs in a high-flying country-rock occasionally emulated--by Rodney Crowell, Charlie Robison, in their way the Dixie Chicks--but never equaled. Not even by Jimmie Dale Gilmore.

Right, Marshall Whoever is homophobic; right, he breathes. In context, the worst thing about his casual fag-baiting is that it's at once so received--like the shock-horror his boys envision in ""Amityville,"" the one provocation here whose boundaries are predictable--and, because he's a devastating wordslinger in every context, so hurtful anyway. But the real Slim Whoever seems far more deeply disturbed about stardom, drugs, his marriage, and boning his mom--which latter, like it or not, is the fantasy (or whatever) that sets all the rest up, a big fat fuck you to the black culture Eminem respects and owes so explicitly, for if Snoop or Too Short or DMX would never say such a thing, just how bad can they be? Disable your prejudgment button and you'll hear a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that's both personal and political, created by one of those charming rogues you encounter so much more often on the page--exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit.

Except to report tediously that he sounds bored and complain ad infinitum that he's obsessed with the love of his life (plus, right, the beats are no good, details later), how else to objectify the cycle of disinterest inevitably inspired by the mainstreaming of 8 Mile? Me, I say good riddance to his rock dreams, so much vainer than his mosh dreams, and note that said noises are hard to listen to, which is a compliment. Funny, catchy, clever, and irreverent past his allotted time, he can't make records this good forever--no one else has.

Because I was between gigs when it came out in late 2013, I never reviewed Eminem's finest post-Encore release. But with Kamikaze dropped just nine months after Revival was trampled into the sod by a gaggle of sheep, I remain impressed by an underrated album that left Eminem well behind such dullards as Queens of the Stone Age and Phosphorescent in the Pazz &amp; Jop Critics' Poll that year. Already Marshall Mathers had worn out his welcome like Jerry Lee Lewis banished with his child bride, an analogy anyone who knows more than two Jerry Lee songs should consider. Lewis wasn't a very stable or likable guy either, but he was an irrepressible virtuoso. He seemed connected to his piano by the brain stem, so imbued with music that he emitted it unbidden, launching songs of every provenance that he might do this way and might do that--or the other. Eminem is far less spontaneous. But here his musicality runs free as his practiced articulation reminds us what flow used to mean, delivering lyrics honed until every line offers up an internal rhyme or stealth homophone or surprise pun or trick enjambment. Also, he holds his Slim Shady side in check here--offensive cracks remain undeveloped, with the ""I'm a sucker for love you a sucker for dick"" stanza delivered by none other than guest paragon Kendrick Lamar. You don't like it, you don't really like the art form, simple as that.

So as two-tone grays out, the Beat follow their chops into the world-beat sweepstakes, where snaky grooves are worth their weight in yen. The Afrobeats and studio spaces and steel drums are as seamlessly colloquial as the depression politics and depressed romances, so it would be a shame if its sinuous midtempos dismay fans of its predecessor's hectic pace. I hear not resignation or compromise but a stubborn, animated adaptability. Unity rocker: ""Doors of Your Heart,"" in which love means eros and agape simultaneously, and Wakeling finds that dread blocks the way to both, and Roger advises him to stop his fighting.

Minimally differentiated variations on the same melody recur and recur, but it's a great melody, and not the only one, and chances are he meant it that way, as a statement, which I agree with. What's more, words take over when the music falters, and on ""Cindy Tells Me"" they combine for the best song ever written about middle-class feminism, a rock and roll subject if ever there was one. My major complaint is that at times the artist uses a filter that puts dust on my needle.

Those crude analogies are mine, not Hudson's, and they're vocal only, plus maybe McCartney/N'Dour's head for business. But Beatles is right: As Hudson puts it, these 23 1979-1981 recordings document an ""uncouth, uneducated racket"" of ""nobodies from the other side of the tracks"" who jump-started the Senegalese music industry and launched the career of a mechanic's son who decades later would be name-dropped as a presidential possibility. Duplicating only four tracks from Rough Guide's coruscating best-of and unearthing seven worthy songs left off Sterns' four long-unobtainable '90s reissues, this collection generates a rough excitement elided by N'Dour on mature albums that compensate with focus and scope.

Before they moved to Warners, which has never flattered their modest gift with the modest collection it deserves (although the 1968 concept album Roots is sweet), Cadence made hay off the teen classics now hawked by half a dozen reissue labels (including Rhino, where they begin an endless box). All of the key moments are on this collection, which lists for $10, and while some may prefer the $20, 31-cut Laserlight triple-CD, I find that too soon their harmonies start sounding neat rather than sharp. This is their very best, epitomizing a strain of pubescence that can't be trusted to repress its horniness past the end of the song. To their elders they're always polite.

With words that always mean everything they want to say and aural pleasures that signify, these songs are among Fagen's finest, and if their circa-1960 vantage returns us to the student memories of Countdown to Ecstasy and Pretzel Logic, their tenderness is never nostalgic and their satire never sophomoric. Fagen's acutely shaded lyrics puts the jazziest music he's ever committed to vinyl into a context that like everything here is loving but very clear-eyed, leaving no doubt that this is a man who knows the limits of cool swing and doesn't believe the world was a decisively better place before John Kennedy died.

It seems crazy to say that her ""Down From Dover"" equals Dolly Parton's or her ""In My Solitude"" Billie Holiday's--they're great singers and she's not. But working together, Faithfull and Willner convert them into pop artsongs that make their own kind of sense in the company of other very different pop artsongs, including Brian Eno and Judee Sill compositions previously beloved only by their mutually exclusive cults.

Based on a Bucharest memorial concert for Ciocarlia's clarinetist leader, it varies their nonstop attack with singers from all over the borderless Roma community. Foremost are icons Esma Redzepova and Saban Bajramovic, whose two songs apiece could send a person surfing after Songs of a Macedonian Gypsy and A Gypsy Legend, respectively. But from godfather Dan Armeanca, whose ""Kan Marau La (I Will Beat Her)"" is recommended to gangsta scholars, to the climactic ""Born to Be Wild,"" composer credit to Mars, Bonfire, this is as impressive a tour of Gypsy pop as any German record man (or woman) could hope.

Targeting the bland cruelty and rapacious cowardice of life in these United States after we lost World War II, they attacked with a merciless vulgarity that was itself unmistakably American, spouting puns and accents like the surrealist tummlers and lapsed English majors they were. Although few '60s groups better grasped the concept-album concept, their longforms excerpt cleanly.

Because the emotional complexities love songs deal in are known to us and assumed by her, we're free to ignore her questionable interpretive powers and luxuriate in an instrument as pleasurable as Sinatra's or Jones's.

Half the songs sound like '50s covers, but only three or four are: Eddie Cochran's ""Somethin' Else"" and Huey Smith's ""Rockin' Pneumonia,"" good calls for the time and they did love their dropped G's, plus Little Richard's ""The Girl Can't Help It,"" composed by jazzbo-for-hire Bobby Troup, and the earlier ""Pistol Packin' Mama,"" beloved of Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters. The primal-sounding ""Love Have Mercy"" and ""Bam Balam"" they made up themselves in an attempt to have simpler and sexier fun than was dreamed of by Blue Cheer, the Sopwith Camel, or the blues-tripping psychedelic establishment. ""The First One Is Free"" may not be altogether tongue-in-cheek. ""A Part From That"" exposes the bummer man. And while ""Pagan Rachel""'s Rachel and ""Brushfire""'s Dottie may strike some as all too old-fashioned sex objects, the prize is ""Laurie Did It,"" which quietly ponders, praises, celebrates, and mourns a dead girlfriend, shaking its fist at God all the while.

Why is this easy-listening rock different from all other easy-listening rock, give or take an ancient harmony or two? Because myths of love lost and found are less invidious (at least in rock and roll) than myths of the road? Because the cute-voiced woman writes and sings the tough lyrics and the husky-voiced woman the vulnerable ones? Because they've got three melodist-vocalists on the job? Because Mick Fleetwood and John McVie learned their rhythm licks playing blues? Because they stuck to this beguiling formula when it barely broken even? Because this album is both more consistent and more eccentric than its blockbuster predecessor? Plus it jumps right out of the speakers at you? Because Otis Spann must be happy for them? Because Peter Green is in heaven?

I love 'em, you may hate 'em, and that's the way Flipper planned it. Live, they play the same two chords until everybody who doesn't want to have fun goes home, then reward those delighted/mesmerized by their synthesis of the Stooges and the Grateful Dead by throwing in an extra chord and revving up half a step. The record somehow manages to achieve the same effect about eight times in forty minutes. For this they're classified as hardcore, but Jim Fouratt (leaning toward hate-'em as their set passed the two-hour mark) calls the band art-damaged and that's more the idea. The playing is crude (""Everybody start at the same time, ready""), unremitting (""Sex Bomb"" has seven words and lasts close to eight minutes), and immensely charitable and good-humored (Iggy with Jerry's soul, I'm not kidding). The lyrics are existential resignation at its most enthusiastic. Inspirational Verse: ""It's Life! Life! Life is the only thing worth living for.""

Am I forgetting somebody, or is this the most unrelenting (and, not to hedge any bets, best) punk debut since the glory days of Ramones-Pistols-Clash? OK, Wire, but really. When the big loud production by Clash/Pistols veteran Bill Price, tweaks classic riffs for hard rock oomph, the riffs carry the power surges, and except for the fame one, the songs live up to the underlining. Amanda Rootes's sex life is at best a draw, but she knows its garish details thoroughly enough to convince anyone willing to stand up there while she spits them out that sooner or later she'll walk away with a victory. Her rage doesn't mean she's strong--it means she's hellbent on getting there.

""I don't think I ever really appreciated Gram until these last few years,"" allows Chris Hillman, whose 1970 arrival catalyzed the Burritos' decline into one-dimensional ""country-rock,"" a term Hillman disdains, probably because ""folk-rock"" is more his speed. ""This collection represents the best and worst of the `Parsons-era Burritos,'"" he clucks, and since Parsons's worst was brainier and more soulful than the folk/country-rock norm, that's why even the outtakes--four songs and one version never available on any U.S. album, including a Bee Gees cover I bet Chris vetoed--have more bite than most anything they recorded after their genius moved farther along. I miss ""My Uncle"" and even ""Hippie Boy"" from Gilded Palace of Sin, and ""Other Guys,"" their least Hillmanesque effort thereafter. But any reissue that respects even the cut order of a timeless LP that it reproduces almost in full deserves its digital remix. Which doesn't overdo the drums, by the way.

Every 60-year-old rocker wants to prove he can still bring it with a chronology-defying overview. Juxtaposing gritty youth and spiritual maturity, early songs you can't forget and late ones you think you remember, the clumsy group he came to hate and the crusty self he can't live without, John Fogerty reels in that dream. His formal compass is so narrow and the Creedence sound so replicable that whatever a track's provenance--some classics get the live-in-aught-five treatment, including a second ""Fortunate Son""--he's always the original roots-rocker displaying the modest facets of his less than glittering personality. Nostalgists may gripe that he sacrifices ""Grapevine"" and ""Suzie Q"" to his creativity and royalty statements. But face it, the covers went on too long. They were the band and the band warn't him.

If Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger were mere satirists, they would be They Might Be Giants. Instead they're lyric poets of what a more naive era called yuppieness, only now we know things aren't so simple--even middle-class people who just want to make some dough are in trouble if they were born after, say, 1965. The title newspeople, the lawyer and the photo assistant who beats him for a cab? They're doing OK. But the guy who's accessorizing his ""'92 Subaru""? Much less so. ""Strapped for Cash""'s gambler anonymous? Not at all. And it's to the band's credit that they want us to know that. But when they home in on the economic, they tend to be satirists only, so it's crucial that as pop adepts who know what closes on Saturday night, they also traffic in romance--and weather it. Sometimes they're hopeless at love, like the lonely antagonists in that cab drama called ""Someone to Love""; sometimes, as in the DMV fantasy ""Yolanda Hayes,"" they're delusional in a nice way; sometimes, as in ""I-95"" and ""Fire in the Canyon,"" they're troubled. So they all need ""Michael and Heather at the Baggage Claim,"" where love triumphs over the geographical displacements that skew so many of these songs. They all also need tunes you'll hum, and get them.

Four different bands, notably the Dixie Flyers and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, keep things rocking at a medium-fast tempo, and what's lost in soul intensity is more than made up for in a kind of dusky barroom aura--if you can imagine walking into some funky cocktail lounge and finding the greatest singer in the world at the piano.

This plays straight to the nouveau-bourgeois black album audience, with all the self-consciousness and instrumentation that implies, but though it's genteel it's never bloodless: Aretha's free-flight improvisations are vehicles of a romanticism extreme and even unhinged enough to soar from the Afro-American experience right into the blithe fantasies of pop. She makes ""Long and Winding Road"" rock and turns the programmatic title anthem into a hymn. She proves herself a fond observer of everyday life on her own ""First Snow in Kokomo."" And on ""Day Dreaming"" she provides a metaphor her American-dreaming sisters and brothers can relate to: the song is wishful thinking, but the man it's about may just be real anyway, and that's the way America is sometimes.

It couldn't have happened without the top-forty revival, and it couldn't have happened without Narada Michael Walden, who unhesitatingly plugged his first legend into one pop format after another and came up with classics almost every time.

Unlike James Brown, say, or Ray Charles, the Queen of Soul is at home with up-to-the-minute black pop, cherry-picking producers the way Jerry Wexler once did songwriters. Cf. the uncountable rhythm tracks of Puffy Combs's apparently simple (and apparently unsampled) ""Never Leave You Again""; Dallas Austin's long-suffering yet somehow jaunty ""I'll Dip,"" on which Aretha sings barely a scrap of the written melody, improvising the verse and embellishing a chorus hook stated by a multitracked backup diva; Daryl Simmons's ""In the Morning,"" disintegrating over and over into a mournful ""I don't wanna be the other woman""; Franklin's own ""The Woman,"" inarticulate in its wronged pain until she moans and scats the coda into a show of the pride she brushed by in the second verse; and Lauryn Hill's equally impressive title cut, whose unaffected big-sisterhood underpins the godmother's most credible feminist outreach ever. None of these 11 songs aspires to the declarative tunes and pungent phrases of the soul era, and at 55 Aretha is losing her high end. But after a decade in artistic seclusion, she had something to prove, and she did--with an album as audacious and accomplished as such great Wexlers as Spirit in the Dark or Young, Gifted and Black.

And astonishingly, they're not just selling to a core audience--this is one of the rare hip hop albums to debut high and rise from there. So you bet they're alternative--they'd better be in a subculture backed into defiant self-pity by rabid reactionaries, lying ex-liberals, and media moguls suddenly conscience-stricken over the nutritional content of what they always considered swill. Forget their debut, from before they discovered the gender-equality formula in which one girl learning equals two guys calling the shots. Forget the Roots, Aceyalone, Pharcyde.

The approach remains quiet, thoughtful--""Needed,"" the pocket autobiography of a horny youth turned corny man that's the best song Fulks ever wrote, travels on a single voice and two guitars. But note that the only time the album hauls out one of those reassuring finger-picking jams is also the only time it turns comic--the no-sex-please-we're-country ""Aunt Peg's New Old Man,"" an old man who wields his long bow to show his nephew-in-law's Scruggs banjo how music's s'posed to sound. Elsewhere the m.o. is subtler. Hear how Brazilian viola textures the unresolved James Agee tribute ""Alabama at Night,"" how ""Baby Rocked Her Dolly"" deploys six pieces to evoke a lonely widower reminiscing in his ""old folks home,"" how Jenny Scheinman's fiddle underlines the adjective in ""America Is a Hard Religion.""

The instrumental track, carried by Sugarhill bassist Doug Wimbish, is so compelling that for a while I listened to it alone on its B-side version. And the rapping is the peak of the form, not verbally--the debut has funnier words--but rhythmically. Quick tradeoffs and clamorous breaks vary the steady-flow rhyming of the individual MCs, and when it comes to Sha-Rock, Miss Plus One herself, who needs variation?

Although this 20-song collection from the '50s relegates ""Flat Foot Floogie"" to a medley and passes over ""Cement Mixer (Put-Ti, Put-Ti)"" and ""Tutti Frutti"" (o-rooney?), it swings and yucks whether the song is a remake, a new stroke, or a piece of Tin Pan Alley silliness.

I admire it, and dig it to the nth, for its tensile contradictions, which are mostly a function of sprung harmony, a perfect model for the asynchronous union at the heart of their political (and rhythmic) message.

Far from it. Gof4's Warner albums always worked as albums, as they will again when they're finally rereleased, and Warner's Brief History of the 20th Century posits a proper beginning, middle, and end. What this jumble does is establish new interconnections--the concert versions and studio remixes hold songs you know up to the light, and mixed in among the old electrofunk adventures their recent techno moves sound principled and in character. Gof4's radical critique/embrace of commodification remains a truth, not the whole truth, so help me God. But it sure hasn't lost relevance.

His first not-too-big/not-too-small since the long-departed Anthology puts 19 songs on the idol disc (including six key duets) and 15 on the nut disc (including one solid previously unreleased). Gaye makes much more than most out of waving his dick, expanding his mind, and proving that jazz needs him more than he needs jazz.

By his own account, he's done a lot of bad things, and within five minutes he's spewing some of the vilest woman-hate in the sorry history of the subgenre. But the detail is so vivid and complex that for once we get the gripping blaxploitation flick gangsta promises rather than the dull or murky one it delivers. True crime tales like the vengeful ""Motherless Child"" and the unstoppable ""260"" are gritty and action-packed, and even the spew plays out as exactly what a long-dicked knucklehead would want to say to the young thing who done him wrong. Then there are moments like ""Camay,"" in which social-climbing crew members move on a legal secretary and an assistant manager at Paragon, and the social-realist family reminiscence ""All That I Got Is You.""

The voice transmutes Major Tom into Roy Orbison, the production glistens like Garth, and fast or slow the tempos never waver. All of which may strike the pure of heart as icky, or inappropriate, but I doubt I'll hear a more gorgeous country record--maybe a more gorgeous record--anytime soon.

My body already knew what my powers of distinction told me when I replayed the Pittsburgh DJ's 2006 breakthrough mashup Night Ripper, which is that this is the one that goes for the jugular: historically guaranteed barn burners like ""Gimme Some Lovin',"" ""A Whiter Shade of Pale,"" ""Rebel Rebel"" and ""96 Tears"" validating modern-day filth on the order of UGK's offensive ""International Players Anthem"" and Three 6 Mafia's odious ""I'd Rather"" (the one where Project Pat pretends he did his bid as a top). But only when I printed out Wikipedia's list of samples [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_the_Animals"">Wikipedia</a>]--good enough for downloaders, though an official version comes with the official release--did I get it. It's like reading along with lyrics no one can fully make out unaided--by the Clash, say. Mining classics like ""Mickey,"" ""Bad Girls"" and ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" for beats you can't ID without a scorecard, chipmunking such totems as the Band, Radiohead, Sinead O'Connor, Styx and the Beastie Boys, marching Kelly Clarkson to Nine Inch Nails and Britney Spears to Air, fabricating duets by Trina and M.I.A. or Public Enemy and Young Leek, Gregg Gillis has plenty to say about music. What he has to say about life, which is that ""I'd Rather"" equals ""Gimme Some Lovin',"" remains more limited. Nevertheless, sequences here give me hope.

Less fun than Feed the Animals because the sample pool is less obvious, but deeper, if stolen party music can be deep, which in his shallow way is what Greg Gillis believes. With the predictable scad-and-a-half of exceptions on an album that claims 373 sources, the strategy is to provide verbal content via the most unpoetic strains of hop-hop--marginal Dirty South club records, say Project Pat's ""Twerk"" or Young Berg's ""Sexy Can,"" of which most fans from outside that world were unaware--and beats/grooves/IDs via canonical rock: U2 and the Ramones, Iggy's ""Lust for Life"" and Miley's ""Party in the U.S.A."" Of course, since these won't necessarily provoke enough partying in the U.S.A., there are also actual beats a level below, drums and that sort of thing. Multifarious posteriors notwithstanding, the lyrics are less raunchy than on Feed the Animals--rated R, not X. As a result, Gillis's vision becomes less orgiastic and more humanistic. Track 10 features Springsteen and Nirvana, track 11 Ice Cube's ""It Was a Good Day,"" and the finale goes out on the daily double Gillis could have conceived the entire record around: the tough-guy sentimentality of UGK's gangsta threnody ""One Day"" over the mods-versus-rockers universalism of John Lennon's late-hippie hymn ""Imagine."" Suffused with hope that someday we'll join him and the world will live as one, Gillis dares Yoko Ono to tell him otherwise.

So unless you're a joiner, home in on a fusion deeper than the Chili Peppers' and call them alternative rock. Right, it so happens that this pointedly integrated group is also pointedly leftist. But while I enjoy the numerous skits partly because I approve of their messages, Columbus and flag-burning and Leonard Peltier don't push my buttons even if abortion and class and pleasure do. I listen to this record because I love the way the rap vocals add muscle and edge to the hard-rock guitar and classic-rock bass. As for the beats per se, they're solid. Even slammin.

They stick to what they know, and their knowledge increases. The quartet's a quintet now, up one violin, which may not seem like much but does serve to reinforce the hooks that have never been a strength of their understated, ever more explicit tales from the bourgeois fringe. So though I was pulled in by ""The Clarke Sisters""--""They sleep in the back of a feminist bookstore""--I soon got involved with every song on the album, with a special rush for ""Right Here,"" where Robert Forster or Grant McLennan, I still have trouble telling them apart, stands by his woman.

Half best-of, half collectorama, this gets you coming and going: you had no idea the album highlights would mesh into perfect pop, and you had no idea the 45-rpm obscurities would coalesce into imperfect pop. What threw you off was that they always seemed too serious for pop, too grown up. But once Robert Forster and Grant McLennan stooped or leaped to melody, they were serious fun in spite of themselves. And bookishly static though they seemed, they were also a band. Forster and McLennan provided the internal tension--subtle friction at its most personal and its most cooperative. Lindy Morrison made sure they moved.

In the Indian summer of a formal moment, singer-songwriter-guitarists Robert Forster and Grant McLennan joined a shifting lineup headed by steadfast drummer-inamorata Lindy Morrison and mercurial violinist-inamorata Amanda Brown to fashion as deep and intricate and prematurely mature a body of traditional relationship songs as, oh, Joni Mitchell herself, who should only have accessed half their empathy and synergy. Hiding their hooks in arrangements and lyrics as often as they brandished them in tunes, they were modest, affectionate, funny, cheerful, never too oblique or ironic--pop for the ages if anything is. But with the 1978-1990 compilation now import-only, novice songseekers are confronted instead by a remastered, reannotated six-album oeuvre. So acquire them all, I guess, thusly: Tallulah (1987, Amanda and ""Right Here""), Spring Hill Fair (1984, produced yet rough), Before Hollywood (1983, austere yet gorgeous), 16 Lovers Lane (1988, poppest), Liberty Belle and the Black Diamond Express (1986, talkiest), Send Me a Lullaby (1981, punkest). Accounted too damn subtle for a U.S. market whose favorite Aussies were MTV flukes and whose favorite Brits had surrealistic haircuts, these Brisbane-bred Londoners' first three albums were never accorded the decency of official U.S. release. This is my paltry attempt to extend a nation's apology.

Robert's songs more tuneful in their maturity, Grant's more atmospheric, they punch 'em all up to make a stronger impression than on their comeback album, thus proving that it was one. Settled down in real life, Robert recaptures his peripatetic past with a clear conscience and a sharp eye; still questing, Grant couches his romanticism in instrumental subtleties that soften his detachment. Robert so fond, Grant so elusive, both so beguiling, they're deeply civilized for the leaders of a working rock band.  And for just that reason they can follow the calling until that distant day when strumming itself is too much for them.

I've never gotten the very few bands like this: neither black nor green Negresses Vertes, strident pub politicos Black 47, squeezeboxing omnivore Kepa Junkera. Even before it jelled, however, I got this. Balkan immigrants flee some combination of thieving bureaucrats, bootstrapping hustlers, Yugoslavian genocide, and anomie. The underworld no-accounts of old Montmartre pursuing Eurotrash chic, they valorize their half-imposed marginalization by reaching out to fellow jetsam from other international backwaters where Islam is an everyday thing. Bootstrapping hustler Eugene Hutz formed a band in this subculture, which for all I know he invented first--rock, yes, but with its segmented groove and village dance rhythms very un-American (and un-African). This album is that band's statement of principle, cri de coeur, and ring grab--Hutz hectoring his way through a bacchanalian rant that's broken into songs that want to be slogans. Sixty revolutions per minute, this is my regular speed. You are the only life there is for yourself my friend. It is all connected through the Gypsy part of town.

Although half the old band are gone, the first two songs resume their crusade with undiminished bravado and a new melodicism that never quits. ""Dig Deep Enough,"" Eugene Hutz half implores and half commands. Why should we, old-timer? Because ""We Rise Again."" Just as powerfully, the next two dabble in both lyricism and the nostalgia Hutz has mocked so adamantly. And although thereafter the songwriting dips from world-historic to merely excellent, this tension powers a revitalization that had damn well better incorporate some change, because without it the ""living and loving"" Hutz insists are the ridiculously simple yet damnably difficult secret of human existence will stiffen and die. No other band worth caring about risks the cosmic like Hutz's immigrant tatterdemalion. Re-examining his past, he imagines a future you can hum in your mind.

With Willie Mitchell performing the Booker T. function, Hi of Memphis has turned into a pocket of naivete (or reaction) (or traditionalism) on the confused black pop scene. Green plays the boyish Sam Cooke supplicant--or maybe a smooth Otis Redding, or an assertive Smokey Robinson--with the startling is-that-a-synthesizer? high note that climaxes ""Tired of Being Alone"" serving as a trademark. He also covers the Doors, the Temptations, Roosevelt Sykes, and the gospel-phase Johnnie Taylor. And closes out side two with some greasy hard funk like you just don't hear anymore.

Green is less open and imaginative than Sam Cooke and less painfully word-wise than Smokey Robinson, but he belongs in their company, that of two of the half dozen prime geniuses of soul. His musical monomania substitutes Memphis for James Brown's Macon, and the consistency of his albums is matched only by Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles. But because he spins his music out over an area not much larger than a hankie, the albums also translate beautifully to a greatest hits format, and this is flawless. For those who refuse to believe the LPs contain hidden treasure and don't care that the singles ""all sound the same."" And for those, like me, who can go both ways with him.

I never got with this album, which in the wake of the late-'74 grits-and-suicide incident kicked off Green's quick commercial decline with its only pop hit, the catchy, slight ""L-O-V-E (Love)."" That one sounds like it was waiting in the can for just such a disaster, and though eventually the post-paranoid ""Rhymes"" and the Afro-percussive ""Love Ritual"" caught my ear on compilations, the two other conventional songs here did not. Then I spun David Toop's midnight-soul concoction Sugar and Poison late this Valentine's Day and finally registered a genius piece I'd played 20 times before: the fluttering, vocalese ""I Didn't Know,"" which makes eight minutes of impossible poetry from lines like ""I didn't know that you feel like you do/Feel like you feel when you feel like you feel."" Along with Sly's ""Just Like a Baby,"" ""I Didn't Know"" is the linchpin of Sugar and Poison, and also the Rosetta stone of this album, which explores four or five other versions of the same idea. ""Love Ritual."" ""The Love Sermon."" It's all L-O-V-E. You got a problem with that?

FALSE,A,The Belle Album,Al Green,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=68,"
Since 1975 Green has been making albums on which two or three real songs were supplemented by material so vague and unpredictable it almost announced itself as filler improvised in the studio--which is not to say I didn't find much of it hypnotic. Now, on a self-produced album focused around his own (frequently acoustic) guitar, the filler comes front and center with new assurance and perhaps even its own formal identity; the real songs themselves--his best in years--sound improvised in the studio. And more than ever, it all holds together around Green's agile rhythm, dynamics, and coloration and his obsession with the soul-body dualism at the heart of the genre he now rules unchallenged.

Meek and mild, The Lord Will Make a Way was Green's sincere attempt to bend to gospel tradition, but on this record it's tradition that bends.

So maybe I relate to his gospel because that isn't really what it is, although it helps that I loved his voice like a church lady long before he turned it to the service of the Lord. Combining the best of two pretty good albums with one cut from the made-whole Higher Plane and another from the stiff Precious Lord, this is where ye of little faith will see the error of your ways.

Generally the soprano signifies purity, which has never been my idea of virtue, not to mention fun. And given how hard it is to achieve, there can be a vanity to it as well--or in earlier Claire Boucher, a self-regarding freakishness. But on this pop-yet-not breakthrough, that pretension is blown away by generous tunes, changeable grooves, and dedicated intensity of purpose. This singer-composer-producer is neither cute nor ethereal, and although the consistency of her register is an affectation by definition, she'll convince anyone who isn't a grouch that she's just being herself, not merely female but, fuck you, feminine--the fairie she likes to claim crossed with a charming three-year-old getting what she wants. Which includes adrenaline highs and mitigated perversity and California love and pornography in phonetic Chinese.

Lofgren is an even better argument than Buddy Holly himself for the historically dubious proposition that rock and roll is the proper province of inspired striplings, because he didn't die. Instead he turned pro, grinding out dozens of overstated, unfulfilled albums before and after Bruce Springsteen provided a use for an enthusiasm that got pretty grotesque as his spontaneity vanished with his chronological youth. Consisting entirely of material selected from or contemporary with the three albums he released before he was 22, these 19 songs are dazzling evidence of the grace and spritz with which the kid fused teen spirit and prodigious virtuosity--an evolved rock and roll that articulates the romantic lyricism left implicit by Holly. Nothing wrong with implication. But you can feel it rising up in such unnecessarily obscure titles as ""Slippery Fingers"" and ""Everybody's Missin' the Sun.""

With his sidekick chiming in only occasionally, Woody's flat vocal affect diminishes the apparent variety of simple tunes a more inspired singer might have made seem classic; it's only after you learn to identify the voice with the lyrics that it does seem classic, and even then it wears considerable over 72 minutes. The songs, however, do not. Jeff Place and Guy Logsdon have conceived an introduction perfect enough to accommodate obscurities and surprises, as it should with a man who could lay down 55 titles in a day. So there are half a dozen public-domain touchstones for context and melodic range, two wild talking blues unreleased since 1964, two children's songs I now consider among his best of any sort, a Lindbergh dis so scathing I want to research the America First movement and find out who ""Wheeler, Clark, and Nye"" were, a Lincoln Brigade anthem so maudlin I hope Franco was as bad as I thought.

While in the past the dull sentimentality that is the downfall of so much country music has flawed his albums, here even the worst song, ""Second Hand Flowers,"" qualifies as bright sentimentality (with a twist). The best is ""Kentucky Feb. 27, '71,"" hidden away on the second side because it's too subtle to make its impact broadside. Simple as death, it recounts Hall's pilgrimage to see an old mountain man, who explains why kids move to the city--""They want to see the things they've heard about""--and apologizes for not providing Hall with a song.

He makes his stories seem easy, like he jots them down on coffee break, and nobody in music can touch them--damn few in fiction, either. I'd call him a cross between Chekhov and O.

He also sings and picks, of course; his sometimes pensive, sometimes rowdy monotone puts across variations on a tiny, well-polished store of classic melodies. Except maybe for ""Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine,"" in which a janitor feeds Hall one of the sentimental truisms that are his nonnarrative downfall, there's not a clinker in this twenty-item carload.

Counting the lust song that quotes a mouthy Australian's anti-American analysis at length, only four tracks are explicitly ""political,"" including a misfire aimed at bulletproof blankets. But ""The More You Know,"" about raising a teenage son in the age of you-know-who, and the homely, specific, devastating ""Not Aretha's Respect (Cops),"" about ""I'm trying to teach him to Not Get Shot,"" are the best protest songs yet by an antifolk ranter who's never soft-pedaled his militantly nonviolent anarchism. And I should also mention the four kiddie ditties about the life cycle of a cartoon frog--as you'll learn from the laff-riot live Big Mouth Strikes Again CD you can own if you buy the vinyl and stream if you don't, this mouthy touring machine has a G-rated set he'll serve up on request at folk festivals and other family affairs.

Four albums in three years, each sonically distinct, each adding a thematic facet to a coherent sensibility. Pretty good for an alleged up-and-comer, eh? In fact, major, and I'll reserve the G-word if you will. Bored with raunchy details, she's going for universals: salvation, rapture, fulfillment, escape. Putting aside her rough lead guitar as unequal to this quest, she's applied herself instead to opera lessons that in no way prettify vocals that were pretty amazing even before they assumed all this range, modulation, and command, and traded in Steve Albini for Flood to help her get at some postsexual imperatives. The fuller sound they arrive at is far from slick--her buzzy keybs are as ominous as her guitar, her register shifts weirder than ever, and the mix can get disconcertingly murky. So watch out for pigeonholes. To fixate on blues or sex is to sell short religious yearnings, avant-garde affinities, and pop potential that are all intensified on an album whose generalization level only magnifies its impact. And to figure she's hellbent on the big time is not to think at all.

Nothing else here can match those tracks. But I'm almost as down with ""Sometimes,"" a ""Personality Crisis"" for outer boroughs kids of the immigrant generation, and assume it sums up who Heems is: not bipolar because his psyche is too multi, but moody and chronically confused. Note that two out of three love songs would be a feat for the most unconfused rapper, with the placeholding ""Pop Song (Games)"" obviously a sop to the label--the other two project emotions too smart for radio's confused-breakup norm. And beneath all this burble beats that suit a musicality worthy of the artist one song here spells ""Jawn Cage.""

At first I responded to this by feel. It seemed loose, free of mannerisms, warmer than the three Experience LPs, as if by dying before it was finished Hendrix left all the sweet lyricism of his cockeyed mystical brotherhood jive unguarded. But it isn't just the flow--these tracks work as individual compositions, from offhand rhapsodies like ""Angel"" and ""Night Bird Flying"" through primal riffsongs like ""Ezy Ryder"" and ""Astro Man"" to inspired goofs like ""My Friend"" and ""Belly Button Window."" What a testament.

FALSE,A,Live at Winterland,The Jimi Hendrix Experience,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1695,"
This reconstructed hour-plus, drawn from the same three-night October '68 engagement that showed up on the 1982 Jimi Hendrix Concerts, is what the format is for. The sound is bigger and better in every way for an artist whose sound was his music--a vast improvement on live analog remixes, a meaningful improvement on the digitals that redefined live Hendrix last year. The uninterrupted length makes sense, conveying a concert's pace and logic into your audio-only living room. Also, the performances are splendid.

FALSE,A,Sankofa,The Highlife Allstars,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11091,"
At first I thought the four credited acts were a de facto aggregation dubbed the Highlife Allstars, and metaphorically they are. The music does change with the billing--vocals are undemonstratively chanted, conversationally emoted, sweetly sung, and instrumentation swells to include organ, horns. Yet whether the named artist is a known oldtimer or one of the small pool of young men who can play the dated style of Ghana's presoukous preeminence, the mood and sound are consistent, rooted in the friendly rhythmic intricacies of palm wine guitar. Juju is too, but the song forms are much clearer here, the commitment to loveliness more straightforward. Until better examples emerge from somebody's vinyl horde, this collection will be a world music template. And N.B.: If the rest of the title seems vaguely familiar, people like the word, which in Akan seems to mean something like, ""You must look at the past before you can proceed into the future."" Wonder what will happen then.

Don't romanticize him. A bluesy veteran whose plentiful earlier music is for loyalists and specialists (cf. his U.K. compilation on Stateside), he turned a Bobby Bland rasp into a trademark at Malaco, which couldn't promote the original anywhere near as profitably. Maybe his secret is that he had less voice to shoot, or that deep down he was more country. Anyway, in the last three years of his life a predominantly black songwriting stable obsessed with the perils of monogamy joined forces with white producers good for soul bottom and dollops of sweetening to make him a regional star. In short, he was a hack who finally hit the jackpot, and this best-of--not the In Memoriam comp Malaco put together right after he died at forty-eight in 1984, not even his breakthrough Down Home--is his testament. It has no secrets, this record, just one great song after another: George Jackson's embittered ""Cheatin in the Next Room,"" Jimmy Lewis's generous ""Get a Little, Give a Little,"" Jimmy Lewis's calculating ""Three Into Two Won't Go,"" Dave Clark's unrepentant ""Friday Is My Day,"" and I could go on. Residual culture, my man Raymond Williams calls this sort of throwback. Hope he'd love it.

Punk aesthetic or no punk aesthetic, Courtney Love's songs wouldn't be compromised and might be deepened by steeper momentum and more articulate guitar noise. But they prevail anyway. Their focus is sexual exploitation, and not just by the media, evil straights, and male predators of every cultural orientation. She's also exploited by Courtney Love, and not only does she know it, she thinks about it. These are the confessions of a self-made feminist bimbo--of the girl who wanted the most cake. Just because she's a phony, whatever that means, doesn't mean the world isn't out to deny her her props.

Finally a compilation format suitable to a minor genius whose achievement seems permanently shrouded in myth: neither 20 astonishing hits nor every hiccup and fingerpick he ever committed to tape, just 50 songs running barely an hour and three-quarters. Even these tracks vary considerably in quality, held together like so much classic pop by the aural glue of an identifiable sound and style--the signature of a miniaturist who till the day he died was comfortable with a radio that preferred two-minute ditties to three-minute extravaganzas, and who found untold emotional and rhythmic nuance within the constriction. He was no nerd, but nerds loved him for a reason: he played by the rules without letting them stop him.

Peter Stampfel is the intense seeker, Steve Weber the mellow layabout. Where Stampfel is all comic focus, whether comic ha-ha or comic-as-opposed-to-tragic, Weber is someone who can just not give a fuck while remaining both charming and musical. Their magic isn't eternal youth--they're as much old codgers as John Hurt and Clarence Ashley in 1963. It's their argument that play is the fundamental life-principle. Among the exhibits: the Henry Clay Work emancipation hullabaloo ""Kingdom Coming"" rewritten to lay more insults on the massa, the scatted dog-yip solo and verse about Simulac-boosting junkie moms that bedecks the psychedeliprop ""Euphoria,"" a sea chantey that climaxes ""Don't you rock me daddy-o,"" a celebration of Buddha's fondness for caffeine and twisted '50s chord progressions, and a girl-group obscurity in which a sweetly love-struck teenager goes gaga over a ""Bad Boy"": ""He'll sell your heart on St. Mark's Place/In glassine envelopes/He'll cut it with a pig's heart/And burn the chumps and dopes.""

This 20-song megacomp steals three songs from 1976's impregnable Have Moicy! and four from 1999's vulnerable Too Much Fun. But I'm too big a fan to blame it for cramming two secret coded messages into one package proving that, as the Bard once put it, age cannot wither nor custom stale their infinite variety. The variety part came with an indelible classic cut on no money and less forethought by whoever dropped in, the age and custom part with a career album cut in their dotage and rural Quebec or vice versa. ""Friends"" include the ageless Michael Hurley and the late Jeffrey Frederick, fully credited cocreators of Have Moicy! who chime in here from their own stubbornly inconsistent solo albums, and Steve Weber, the not unholy rounder who's been Peter Stampfel's opposite number for 40 years. But Stampfel's spirit dominates, as it should. It's he who discovered that Henry Clay Work's 1862 ""Kingdom Coming"" was the first true pop song. And it's he who put one of 20 otherwise awful-I-bet songs called ""Nova"" on the Rounders' spotty-I-know 1975 Alleged in Their Own Time: ""Time is on my side/Slime is on my tide/I ride my time slide all the time/I'm a lazy [ellipsis in original].""

Two of these excellent songs--""So You Win Again"" and ""Rumours""--have never been available on a U.S. album, and there's only one cop from the highly recommended A side of Cicero Park.

Bet both Pfeifer and Marcarian were raised up in the First Church of Humanity (Secular), because unlike Elvis II and the X kids, for instance, they don't find much thrill in confessional--just get annoyed, pissed off, very pissed off, and insane with rage. Also unlike the aforementioned, they get lyrical, quite light and playful in fact, which adds charm to their organ-based garage style.

After the bland Remember My Name soundtrack, John Hammond's gem is a blessing--it would have been tragic if the rebirth of this eighty-five-year-old wonder of nature and history, easily the most authoritative classic blues singer alive, had been documented only in print. A hot rhythm section, anchored by pianist Gerald Cook and jazzed up by hornmen Vic Dickenson, Doc Cheatham, and Frank Wess, pitch in with undeniable verve on material from ""The Darktown Strutters' Ball"" to ""Always"" to several worthy Hunter originals. Timing and intonation are as savvy as you'd figure, and though the voice isn't quite as full as it must have been, it packs an amazing wallop--when Hunter gloats about getting her butter churned, the memory sounds quite fresh, like maybe the dairy man poked his head in that morning. More good news--she'll be back in the studio with Hammond soon.

For some reason folk specialists hold these clear if casual tapes in low esteem, but I think they stand with his other Vanguard music. Recorded in a Manhattan hotel in February and July 1966, shortly before he died, they capture the same playful warmth and quiet rhythmic assurance that marked all his work. These aren't qualities especially well-served by youth, which is one reason Hurt exerted instant artistic authority when he was rediscovered in 1963 at age seventy-one. From ""Funky Butt"" to ""Shortnin' Bread,"" this is a man who was always ready to meet his maker.

Learning and diversifying, remembering where he comes from and sticking to what he knows, Ice-T wins big as the old school shakes out. He won't desert the hards because a hard he remains; his violence is pervasive and graphic because he knows brutalization from the inside. But he's nothing if not a moralist, and so the new jack drunk dies in his Benz, the cops break down the gangbanger's door, his gays are left to live their own lives, and his prematurely ejaculated sex jam is a dis on the horny fool who slavers for it. Since most of what I know about the hard audience comes from rap records, I can't guarantee he'll get away with it. But I can guarantee that this one has something to teach everyone who can stand to listen to it and almost everyone who can't.

I missed ""Cop Killer"" (at least ""KKK Bitch,"" or--remember, Eminem?--""Momma's Gotta Die Tonight"") until I accepted Ice-T for what he here chooses to be: not an outrageous ironist but a cold-eyed truth peddler, a man who knows from well-remembered, -observed, and -imagined experience that crime sometimes pays and usually doesn't. Not only does no G get trepanned here, no woman gets misused; the violence is almost all suffered or recalled. Thus contextualized, the clarity, economy, and devastating detail of the man's rapping and rhyming are a benison, turning the spare beats he favors into an ascetic aesthetic.

Former president James Garfield makes a cameo appearance. Vocalist Nancy Jeffries applies her tobacco voice to a feminist lyric called ""Trip on Me"" that I recommend to Janis Joplin. The blues scholars in the group have been listening to a lot of Arabic and Eastern European music lately, but this doesn't stop Elvin Jones from sounding just like Elvin Jones. In short, these passionate humanists also sound friendly and have come up with a charming, joyous, irrepressibly experimental record. And every experiment works.

The Americana pigeonhole sets up rootsy expectations Isbell has too keen a mind for. And though he obviously isn't the only Nashville guy ever to placate his demons with Jack and coke or the only folkie ever beset by night thoughts, neither ""country"" or ""singer-songwriter"" suits him either--he's too intellectual for one, too downhome for the other. So 15 years after the Drive-Bys brought in a tenor who could write, 10 years after he quit them while his first wife stayed on, five years after he got sober, and two years after there was a baby on the way, here are some of the words his tenor lets fly. Over the tolling guitars of ""White Man's World"": ""There's no such thing as someone else's war / Your creature comforts aren't the only things worth fighting for."" Over the female counterpoint of ""If We Were Vampires"": ""Maybe we'll get 40 years together / But one day I'll be gone, one day you'll be gone.""

The best-selling album of the millennium was clearly a hits-plus-filler job from the beginning--what we couldn't know is how brilliantly every hit but ""P.Y.T."" would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure. The inexhaustible ""Beat It"" broadcasts Eddie Van Halen wielding his might in the service of the antimacho that is his secret vice. ""The Girl Is Mine"" got interracial love on the radio and proved cuter than ""Michelle."" ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"" starts something every time an air or floor jock starts it up. ""Billie Jean"" is Michael's clearest statement to date on sexuality and stardom. And ""Thriller"" is the rare song that's improved by its video, which fleshes out the not-quite-a-joke scariness of ""the funk of 40,000 years"" for (Michael and) his (white) fans.

In addition to her junkie ways, her hack support, her adoring claque, and her bewildering discography, what makes James a myth and a secret at the same time is how hard she is to classify. Blues, jazz, pop, rock, soul--she's all of these and none, because what she really is is r&amp;b, in its original sense: blues so fetching white people can't help but love 'em even though they're aimed at young blacks. She's got that kid thing--a big reason her dirty voice is such a permanent scandal is that for all the hard experience she conveyed at 15 she still sounds underage as she comes up on 60, never outgrowing a sensibility she was old-beyond-her-years for as she worked through the '50s and behind-the-times with when she hit in the '60s. She's been recycled as relentlessly as the grease in a french fryer. But from the makeout-party schmaltz of ""Sunday Kind of Love"" to the Muscle Shoals fatback of ""Tell Mama,"" this 20-song exploitation finally gets her sensibility right.

Aretha's her competition, too--even today, James's voice is a wonder, so gritty it's filthy and so sweet it's filthier than that. Only 22 when this 1960-76 span began, she was possessed of a shrewd intelligence that understood standards like ""Lover Man"" and ""Don't Get Around Much Anymore"" just fine--r&amp;b singers had been changing pace with the stuff since the '40s. She only stumbled artistically when she learned how meaningful she was. Graded leniently for deep-sixing Randy Newman's ""You Can Leave Your Hat On.""

Unspiritual clod that I am, I can live my life content without ever going along on one of Jarrett's endless solo pilgrimages, but I love this collection of circa-1976 quartet material. Ah, ain't theme-and-improvisation grand, especially when Dewey Redman is showing so much control and heart on the saxophone that dominates what is nominally a pianist's record. Redman also contributes two angular compositions and a desultory one that I like anyway, and Charlie Haden chips in another two. I don't even mind when Jarrett plays soprano sax, or sounds--appropriately enough--like Brubeck on the final cut. Ah, ain't group creation grand.

Sean Carter isn't the first crime-linked hitmaker with a penchant for kicking broads out of bed at 6:15 in the morning. Frank Sinatra beat him to it. Right, Sinatra never boasted about his own callousness--not publicly, in song--and that's a big difference. Jay-Z has too many units tied up in playing the now-a-rapper-now-a-thug ""reality"" game with his customers, thugs and fantasists both, and only when he lets the token Amil talk back for a verse does he make room for female reality. But he goes for a rugged, expansive vigor, nailing both come-fly-with-me cosmopolitanism and the hunger for excitement that's turned gangster hangouts into musical hotbeds from Buenos Aires to Kansas City. You don't expect a song called ""Big Pimpin' "" to sound as if the tracks were recorded in Cairo. This one does.

History has vindicated this album. On a meticulously hyped valedictory no one believed would be his actual farewell, the fanfares, ovations, maternal reminiscences, and vamp-till-ready shout-outs were overblown at best. But on an album where the biggest rapper of all time announces that he's the biggest rapper of all time, they're prophetic. Bitch about Kingdom Come and American Gangster if you must, but not The Blueprint 3 or Watch the Throne, and not his label presidency, amassed fortune, or close personal relationship with Warren Buffett. He's got a right to celebrate his autobiography in rhyme because he's on track to become a personage who dwarfs any mere rapper, and not only can he hire the best help dark green can buy, he can make it sing. Tracks four through nine enlist Kanye West, the Neptunes, Timbaland, 9th Wonder, Eminem, and Rick Rubin. Each one sounds different, each one means different, and each one kills. I'm also touched when ""Justify My Thug"" tag-teams Madonna and Run-D.M.C. Hova if you hear me.

Early blues' biggest male hitmaker--which means at the very least that Paramount recorded him a lot--has long been uncopyrighted, and this selection comes tagging behind the Yazoo CD that shortened the Yazoo double-LP and more European completism than any nonspecialist need explore. A solid singer and facile guitarist, Jefferson was also a mortal songwriter whose dynamic range can weary subconnoisseurs pretty quick--for most of us, one CD is enough. That said, the sound here is fuller and clearer than what competition I've been able to A-B, and why Yazoo omitted ""Black Snake Moan"" is the kind of mystery only aging blues boys understand. Most of the time Jefferson plays the rounder's role, but since what he really was was a pro, he rose or sunk occasionally to Christian grace, as in the ineffable ""I Want to Be Like Jesus in My Heart."" Moreover, Jefferson is only half this package. The bonus disc is one I missed, Rough Guide to Country Blues Pioneers, a refreshingly nonconnoisseur selection that leads with Big Bill Broonzy's sophisticated ""Long Tall Mama"" and ends with Sam Collins's lilting ""My Road Is Rough and Rocky"" while venturing post-1931 only to include Leadbelly, Memphis Minnie, and Robert Johnson, all of whom you'll welcome aboard.

Hence her albums have failed to ignite even though explosions were what her commitment to the rock and roll basics was supposed to insure. But this compilation is the cherry bomb. Combining her own songwriting peaks--from ""Bad Reputation"" and ""I Love Rock n Roll"" to ""Fake Friends"" and the Light of Day non-Oscar winner--with the like-minded strokes of such symbolic friends as Sly Stone, Jonathan Richman, and Tommy James, the material only dips as semiretirement approaches.

As with the otherwise radically dissimilar Otis Redding, this depthless bantamweight's unique soul power was old beyond its years--a gift of his gene pool more than his life experience. He imbued longing, anxiety, arrogance, pain, lust, and generic escapism with a self-possession that sounds spiritual even if it's entirely somatic. When he cut the shrewd ""All Around the World,"" the bereft ""Need Your Love So Bad,"" and the consoled ""Home at Last,"" he was 17 years old. When he cut a ""Fever"" so fervid Peggy Lee couldn't top it with a strip-tease, he was 18. When he last charted, he was 23.

Between 1927 and 1930, in his early thirties and probably his prime, the Texas-based Johnson applied his gravelly voice and dexterous bottleneck to 28 gospel sides. On 19 of these he was accompanied by a female singer, usually his first wife Willie Harris, and in a sense lyrics and melodies are rendered superfluous by the sound of his gruff false bass shadowed and set right by a simpatico soprano: a sane, haunting aural image of suffering and succor that's hard to get too much of. But most of the songs are at least solid in themselves, and refreshingly unfamiliar unless Johnson planted the seed of their renown, as he did with ""Motherless Children,"" ""If I Had My Way,"" ""John the Revelator,"" and the indomitable ""Praise God I'm Satisfied."" Like most gospel, they value melodic flow and rhythmic momentum more than the Delta blues other Johnsons purveyed. I'm not going to say they rock. But you might.

All of Johnson's 30 recordings are on Columbia/Legacy's The Complete Blind Willie Johnson double, the sorely missed ""Praise God I'm Satisfied"" included. This remaster quiets considerable surface noise without much enhancing the size of a voice that's not merely gravelly--more like a bass gargling with actual pebbles. Yet there are reasons for a newcomer to opt for it. Johnson wasn't such a songbag that you need more than the 22 tracks that fit on one CD. Moreover, Rough Guide provides a ""Gospel Blues Legends album"" bonus disc--a catchall that includes such sinners as Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bukka White, Skip James, and Barbecue Bob in Sunday-morning mode as well as specialists in God's guitar like the Reverend Gary Davis and the philosophical Washington Phillips, whose magic zither tune ""Denomination Blues"" provides a doxology: ""It's right to stand together, it's wrong to stand apart / 'Cause none's gonna enter but the pure in heart / And that's all, now I tell you that's all / But you better have Jesus now, I tell you that's all.""

For a while I thought the light-handed fills, tricky horn parts, and swinging rhythms went against the artist's hard-hitting message, not to mention my own hard-hitting tastes. Only after seeing him live did I recognize those embellishments for what they were--hooks. Dennis Bovell's arrangements take the natural lilt of LKJ's self-conscious patois to a new level of musicality. He may not be quite the man of the people he wants to be, but he comes a damn sight closer than most leftists (not to mention most semipopular musicians), which is why he puts so much care into the pleasure of his propaganda.

FALSE,A,Tings An' Times,Linton Kwesi Johnson,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2067,"
A concept album about political fatigue, a theme the man understands deeply and cogently and aphoristically and colloquially and polysyllabically. Johnson always talks, never sings, but his assumed patois is like Leonard Cohen with funkentelechy--the speech of his people is music to his ears, and the music of his people is manna. So the riddims skip by on Dennis Bovell's ska-speedy tempos, graced with tricky guitar hooks and colored with fiddle and accordion that sing Hungary and Algeria and Colombia and the Rio Grande as Johnson ""consider how young rebels get old."" ""Sense Outa Nansense"" is a homily about innocents and fools played out as an animal fable, its punch line not words but a regretfully disparaging click of the tongue. ""Story"" gets behind black masks. ""Tings an' Times"" starts ""Beat doped demoralized/Dizzied dazed and traumatized"" and goes on from there. ""Di Good Life"" utters the name of socialism--""Some say him is a ghost/Some say him is a sage/But nobody know him rightfully yet/Or where him come from."" ""Di Anfinish Revalueshan"" somehow finds hope in confusion and compromise. And in ""Mi Revalueshanary Fren,"" Linton tries to reason with an old Marxist about glasnost. Problem is, the Marxist has wigged out--all the reason is on Linton's side. Analysis, analysis, who's got the analysis? Surely not a reggae man?

FALSE,A,Musical Depreciation Revue: The Spike Jones Anthology,Spike Jones,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6021,"
I've heard bitch-and-hoe jokes funnier than the ugly ""Wild Bill Hiccup"" and the wife-baiting ""Happy New Year."" But the king of musical comedy cared too little for sex to let reflexive misogyny stand in his way. He was a stickler for detail in a good cause--the democratic largesse of his panethnic stereotyping reveals Zappa's misanthropic perfectionism for the baseless condescension it was, and no one deserves his panoply of fart noises more than the German tyrant and Italian composers he cut them for. Liberace and Peter Lorre and Maurice Chevalier and I hope tiki music are behind us forever, but the fun he made of them lives on. And the winner is--Fietlebaum.

FALSE,A,Janis Joplin's Greatest Hits,Janis Joplin,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1665,"
I was disheartened to learn that five of these ten tracks were cut with Full Tilt Boogie, but one of them is a live ""Ball and Chain,"" and I'm delighted to report that such competent classics as ""Cry Baby"" and ""Move Over"" sound a lot more raucous following ""Try"" and ""Bye Bye Baby"" than they did on Pearl. In short, this blatant piece of product represents her more fully than any other disc: spontaneity as rebellion, tied to the will, the major mode of the late '60s, preserved--imperfectly, of course--forever on a piece of plastic.

FALSE,A,Janis,Janis Joplin,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1666,"
Having long ago wondered how she'd ""hold up,"" I eventually concluded the answer was that I didn't feel like playing her records anymore. But it was just the opposite: one reason the music triumphs more miraculously than ever is that it's damned hard to listen to, fading into the background about as smoothly as Ornette or the Dolls or PJ Harvey. The most polished product here is the least compelling--it's in her demos, her live fracases with Kozmic Blues and Full Tilt Boogie, and especially her rough anything-goes with Big Brother that she demolishes the canard that she was some kind of blues imitator or hippie fool. For her, blues was a language to be twisted and shredded in the service of a utopian quest, a quest I swear she had the stuff to take somewhere. My only quarrel with this superb re-creation, which unveils many terrific previously unissueds and contextualizes several older finds, is that it sacrifices live rarities like ""Ego Blues"" to the Kosmic Blues album. You want to know more, read the liner essays by Ellen Willis and Ann Powers, which I hope aren't over the Grammy guys' heads.

FALSE,A,Joy of Cooking,Joy of Cooking,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1858,"
Led by ex-folkie Toni Brown (the principal composer) and ex-blueswoman Terry Garthwaite (whose three rhythm songs sizzle joyously), this may not be your idea of rock and roll. The music revolves around Brown's piano, which rolls more than it rocks, and the band goes for multi-percussion rather than the old in-out. I find it relaxing and exciting and amazingly durable; I can dance to it, and I can also fuck to it. The musical dynamic pits Brown's collegiate contralto against Garthwaite's sandpaper soul, and the lyrics are feminist breakthroughs. ""Too Late, but Not Forgotten"" remembers a trailer camp while ""Red Wine at Noon"" touches international finance, but the two protagonists are united by one overriding fact--they're victimized as wives. And it's about time somebody in rock and roll said so.

FALSE,A,Run Fast,The Julie Ruin,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16092,"
Although I read in the Times that late-stage Lyme disease sufferer Kathleen Hanna's first album since 2004 includes ""several peppy numbers about euthanasia,"" I dare you to figure out which they are. What's easy to tell is that at 44, the riot godmotherrr commands pretty much the same old skinny soprano, only with soft edges that sound tender or thoughtful sometimes. You can make out enough lyrics to determine that these vulnerabilities don't come at the cost of crazee abandon, modulated tantrum, or childish drawl. And you soon realize that the music continues a trajectory that runs from Bikini Kill through Le Tigre to this version of the pop music every great punk loves: surf guitar, bongo effects, keyboard hooks from Hammond to EDM, and--crucially, I think--a male voice on occasion, mostly for deep ballast. Some say she's from Mars, or one of the seven stars that shine after 3:30 in the morning. But she isn't.

FALSE,A,Done by the Forces of Nature,Jungle Brothers,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1863,"
Somehow these young Afro-New Yorkers have evolved a rap version of urban African pop at its most life-affirming: the boasts low-key, the propaganda beyond hostility, the samples evoking everything tolerant and humane in recent black-music memory, this is music designed to comfort and sustain. Between DJ AfriKa's casual drawl and sidetalk that ebbs and flows under the main track like an inner-city McCabe and Mrs. Miller, the sound is as original as De La Soul's, and the dreams of pleasure are straight out the urban jungle--in my favorite, a smooth brother muses to the Coasters' ""Shopping for Clothes"" as a tropical stream washes over his family jewels. And though I can live without promises that the final judgment is at hand, the JB's do wonders for one's sense of doom just by sounding merciful.

FALSE,A,First Grade,Thomas Jefferson Kaye,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3937,"
Like the Triumvirate album he produced for John Hammond, Mike Bloomfield, and Dr. John, Kaye's debut was sensually laid-back, with a sly intelligence he hoped to pass off as an active relationship with his environment. But this one stands beside Eric Clapton's 461 Ocean Boulevard as a critique of the laid-back mode. The secret is the covers, which I bet producer Gary Katz (also of Steely Dan) had something to do with--especially since the whole album centers around Fagen &amp; Becker's bitter, poignant farewell to the counterculture, ""American Lovers."" Together with Loudon Wainwright's painful ""Say That You Love Me"" and natural boogies from Link Wray and Dr. John, it puts such Kaye titles as ""Northern California"" and ""Easy Kind of Feeling"" into the ironic perspective the artist intends. Maybe this is Katz rather than Kaye--but when you hear Kaye describe a ""new religion/Called everything's gonna be all right,"" you won't think so.

The temptation once again is to attribute the straight-ahead passion of the big cheb's return bid to neotraditionalist Don Was, who adds funk bass, steel guitar, Was (Not Was) sax, and other unidiomatically consonant Americanisms to the already elaborate (and funky) production strategies the artist learned from the brothers Ahmed. But once again the alternate producer's Gallicisms--this time, Philippe Eidel's musette accordion, music-hall piano, and imported rafts of Cairo violins--fill out his songs less obtrusively if less strikingly. Hey, there's a thought--songs. Most of these were hits where and when it counted even if we've never heard them before. Can't hurt, can it?

FALSE,A,American Teen,Khalid,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17029,"
Deft line by deft line, each self-evident, each unprecedented, the first half of this R&amp;B album justifies its title with a clarity and candor so astonishing it overshadows the music's racial identity: ""I'm 18 and I still live with my parents,"" ""Young dumb broke high school kids,"" ""Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do,"" ""There's so much trouble to get into,"" ""I don't want to fall in love off of subtweets,"" ""I'll keep your number saved,"" ""I let the words come together/Then maybe I'll feel better,"" and most tellingly of all, ""We don't always say what we mean."" Second half is skillful but conventional--seven succinct, catchy unrequited love songs all in a row. Khalid Robinson sings in a winning conversational murmur with room for growth, and because the vocals are as unassuming as the words, the song structures he concocts with various pals and pros seems more straightforward than they are. Figure this is a nice young man with a big future, and hope with all your heart that the latter doesn't swallow up the former before we know it.

FALSE,A,Lost In Qawwali,Badar Ali Khan,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=224,"
Cousin of Nusrat, big deal--there's probably whole villages of 'em. Only this one's released the hottest qawwali record I've ever heard. No Western instruments, just harmonium, tabla, and handclaps, but also no ghazals--at times I swear it swings, and direct comparison to the master makes startlingly clear that the higher pitches, faster tempos, and precipitate ascent into ecstasy very nearly create a new subgenre: speed-qawwali. The 13-minute lead track supposedly sold a million as a Pakistani cassingle, and I bet it created a scandal. Nonbelievers, on the other hand, will get Badar easier than they ever did the former real thing. Deep? How would I know? But as intense an hour of music as you'll hear all year.

August Darnell has synthesized his polyglot influences so thoroughly you'd think all show music is written over a fast funk bottom. Two of the eight tunes--""Imitation,"" a sortastar's complaint in disguise, and the mum ""Stool Pigeon""--could use some narrative context, but usually it doesn't even matter much that Augie is singing. The end pieces are the wickedest: ""Annie, I'm Not Your Daddy,"" in which he breaks it to her traumatically, and ""No Fish Today,"" the nastiest song about class since ""Career Opportunities.""

FALSE,A,The Best of B.B. King Volume One,B.B. King,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5982,"
Like Louis Armstrong before him, King has evolved into American totem and international ambassador, so reliable that he obscures his own formal audacity. Since he concocted his music rather than inventing it whole, mutating Mississippi seeds into an all-inclusive synthesis he no doubt conceived during his brilliant DJing career, it's hard to keep in mind how startling and triumphant he once was. This man was an r&amp;b ruler in the '50s because he could do it all--not just electrify Robert and Lonnie Johnson simultaneously, but croon and growl and split the air while writing standards almost as fast as Willie Dixon. Anyone who thinks he's too smooth can kiss his ass.

FALSE,A,The Kink Kronikles,The Kinks,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3677,"
Self-konfessed kultist John Mendelsohn has kreated an inkomparable kompilation. Great hits are few--the Kinks have made U.S. top forty only twice since their first best-of, with ""Lola"" and ""Sunny Afternoon."" But great songs abound, assembled with a konnoisseur's kraft (all right, I'll stop) from available (and deleted) LPs, uncollected singles (told you I'd stop), and the vaults. Mendelsohn has little use for Ray Davies the would-be satirist (""Well-Respected Man,"" etc.), apologizing even for such marginally ""boorish"" efforts as ""King Kong"" and ""Mr. Pleasant."" So we get twenty-eight tracks that concentrate on Davies the lyric realist, the poet of pathos and aspiration, at his tuneful, readymade best. Definitely the world's most charming (and untidy) ripoff artist. And he wrote ""Waterloo Sunset,"" the most beautiful song in the English language.

What a treat to have Lorin Sklamberg singing in English, with the gentleness and precision non-Yiddish speakers sense in him elaborated and specified by the dozen Guthrie lyrics Sklamberg and his cohort turn into music. He's cheery for the neighborhood pep rally, transported for the mystic prophecy, tenderly humorous for the lullaby, delicately feminine for the tale of two rings, a wedding singer when the music gets Balkan (or is that Middle Eastern?), a Marxist simp with a Scotch-Irish melody dreaming of roads paved with the ""finest of plastics."" One of the age's signal voices, finally available on terms an Al Green fan can understand.

FALSE,A,Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukah,The Klezmatics,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13424,"
Lorin Sklamberg and his wondrous band found only eight Hanukkah lyrics by the Scotch-Irish Okie, who got interested in the subject while raising a family with his Jewish wife, and most of them were in Guthrie's silliest kiddie style: ""Honeyky Hanuka"" is a typical title, ""Dinga lingle lingle, I ring your bell"" a resonant line. And from this they create as upful a holiday album as I can recall. Sklamberg's tenor is a treasure of American music, adding wit and warmth to predominantly Yiddish-style melodies as bright as any Guthrie ever stole or created. They spritz up ""Happy Joyous Hanuka"" with hoedown fiddle, gospel bass and country licks, and later on leave room for, why not, Jew's harp. And to get to 12 tracks, they add four instrumentals. Can't pin down the R&amp;B novelty Frank London raided for ""(Do the) Latke Flip-Flop."" Maybe we'll figure it out at Christmas dinner.

FALSE,A,The Dusty Foot Philosopher,K'naan,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14085,"
Hip-hop is the most vital musical genre on the planet and Afropop has a glorious history. But African hip-hop is uneven, awkwardly derivative, hard to hear from the outside. So this Somalia-born Canadian is some kind of miracle worker. After rapping phonetically to CDs mailed to Mogadishu by his father, a Third World intellectual turned immigrant cabdriver, K'naan learned English from scratch when he finally escaped Mogadishu himself, and his skills are gigantic. What accent he has is subsumed in his high, sharp, unexpectedly comedic flow. He embellishes his simple beats with deft choruses and tunelets, and his African effects are savvy and unforced. The album opens with water music I'd tag as Mbuti, meaning forest-derived, although Somalia is desert--a sound I've always believed rappers should sample for the delight of it, and that he makes signify. Before you assume the guy is kinda soft, imagine the war-zone childhood described in ""What's Hardcore?"" He thinks you're soft, and will take you down if you get in his way.

Surrounded and set up by bizarro-world electronic ""dance"" music as engaging as prime Burial and playful to boot, even the arty stuff signifies--sometimes as soundscape and sometimes as slap upside the head, as in the scraped cello-I-think of ""Fracking Fluid Injection."" The one exception, the 19-minute electronic-drone-with-apostrophes ""Old Dreams Waiting to Be Realized,"" isn't calming or trancey, just an inoffensive tune-out. Conveniently, however, that one's a bonus track even if neither band nor label advertise it as such--available only on a two-CD ""deluxe edition"" whose sole additional attraction is a comic book satirizing the superrich, who I guess they figure won't think twice about buying it. Poor me recommends the single disc, an hour and a quarter of music that's the opposite of inoffensive--an exciting, multivalent Dreijer sibling showcase. Karin provides saving shades of humanity by exercising the vocal cords nature gave her. But Olof's imagination, sense of humor, and bent rebop carry the day.

After releasing six mixtapes between February 2013 and March 2014, the multicultural who broke up Das Racist rested, and this was a good place to stop--a culmination, temporary or maybe not. Splitting the difference between modest confidence and cool diffidence, he claims ""best rapper in the world"" as a joke because these days a joke is a lot better than nothing if it's brainy and benevolent and keeps you in food, shelter, and airplane travel. Old materials you won't mind hearing again are recycled occasionally. First-string cameo providers Lady Bug, Talib Kweli, and Del the Funkee Whatever add class. Amaze 88 and the beatmaking corps keep the flow relaxed, strange, and thrift-store lush. Near the end of the opening ""Open Letter,"" this best rapper in the world tosses off a metaphor that rhymes with ""metaphor"": ""If you headed for a wall you better set a course through a door."" Clearly, that's what he thinks he's done. Here's hoping that door either stays open or led him into a room where he can get his work done when he's in the mood.

I swear I thought the third album by Youssou N'Dour's ngoni man of choice might be the best ever to come out of Mali even before I got to the notes. There I learned that recording began on the day Kouyate's friend the president was overthrown by the military, and that two songs celebrate anti-Islamist heroes of 19th-century Mali--a martyr whose refusal to leave his animist faith inspired his Muslim protector to fight to his own death for it and a soldier who drank beer in the sanctimonious face of the Muslim cheikh who'd persuaded him to fight for a faith he refused to obey to the letter. From the title party anthem on out, the mood and message are inclusive not just because sharia law proscribes music altogether but because Timbuktu anti-clericalist Khaira Arby gets a track, because the Taj Mahal cameo is the most irreverent Malian blues ever recorded, because every song is fired by Kouyate's political and philosophical passion. Two melodies reach back centuries. Strong-voiced frontwoman Amy Sacko delivers the word. And although the ngoni is a mere lute, Kouyate gets more noises you want to hear out of his strings than any two jam-band hotshots you can name.

Born on a Wednesday full of woe, a 58-year-old Chicago neonatologist undertakes to show the world he's also a major songwriter, complete with wavery high baritone that hurts so much it'll make ordinary mortals wince. Although most of his evidence dates from the current century, only two selections are near new. The most recent goes on about Nero--""At night in his garden, Christian torches glow / He entertained the masses with fiddle and bow""--before observing that ""a lie is a lie, and not 'fake news,'"" and should you wonder what a Christian torch is, the CD comes with a useful booklet that will also make you wince. So will ""The Gospel According to Carl,"" which re-enacts the pre-suicide ruminations of a car salesman who just discovered his conscience, and ""Ain't It So Nice Outside Today?,"" which diagnoses suffering sinners who lust for life against all odds. Two songs praise Sid Vicious, a bunch indicate in agonizing yet generous detail why the guy's love life hasn't been everything it might, and the most memorable of all can't get over that girl he ditched so stupid when he was 17. Krueger's band accommodates horns, violin, accordion, and femme chorus. He borrows afterhooks from Bonnie Tyler and Jose Feliciano. And somehow I never mentioned that he can be pretty funny. Also nice.

On his second self-financed album of 2018, an ambitious project Dr. Krueger reports was ""as expensive as owning and operating a large yacht""--trifold CD case, 20-page booklet, cameos from 11 studios nationwide--the singing neonatologist juxtaposes selections from his '85-'98 (Then) and '07-'18 (NOW) songbooks, between which he wrote nothing except an array of scientific papers we'll assume share with his songs both spectacular intelligence and irrepressible verbiage. Three of the NOW songs are superb--""Kenny's (It's Almost Christmas in This Bar),"" the good-time opener every smart guy needs; ""O What a Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful Day,"" the lowdown from the obstetrics theater; and the jaw-dropping ""Don,"" about a contrarian youth, why Leopold loved Loeb, and the untrustworthiness of all entertainment. But that leaves out the guy with the underwater mortgage and a Wal-Mart tent and whether Robert Johnson understood a word Charley Patton said, both NOW, and also the love song that survived the marriage and the love song about the waitress hung up on Leon Trotsky, Graham Greene, and Rick Derringer, both Then. That last one does get a little Byzantine. Nonetheless, here be a literary songwriter of the first rank whose pipes benefited from his long break and who's reeled in enough fine musicians to execute his ambitious arrangements. Vanity projects seldom come prouder.

There is one true Fela experience, and that experience is long. L-o-n-g. Unless qawwali counts, no one in pop has ever gone on so unceasingly for so long. Even Phish and such mix in song-type fragments to give folks a rest. Fela's practice was to release 30-minute albums with two cuts on them, or to dispense with this formality and designate the sides parts one and two. As a result, this 158-minute double-CD comprises all of 13 titles. But of these, more than half are edited or cut unceremoniously in half, which is great, because long can wear out fast. Most Fela albums, including the 20 MCA has arrayed across an overdue reissue blitz of 10 CDs that pass by such renowned releases as Zombie, Black President, and Army Arrangement, are listenable enough. Few, however, are the knockout punches his notices lead thrill seekers to expect--their attractions are more unfocused than an artist so militant requires. Here that's not a problem. Long though they still are, all are marked by top-notch tirades, explosive horn blasts, riffs he'll never improve no matter how often he tries. Certainly some original albums are of a quality that renders the usual duplication caveats moot. But this is the one you need, a masterful piece of compilation for an artist who deserves the best.

Sixteen songs in an hour, half with her name on them and half farmed out, add up to 2014's most ambitious and accomplished big-ticket album. Pragmatically, Lambert front-loads the hookiest material, getting us to track 11 or 12, with four of her cowrites tailing off just slightly at the end. Among those, ""Holding On to You,"" although not quite a grabber, mixes formal exercise with idealized autobio the way pop songs do, a connubial hymn it's hard to imagine Blake Shelton deserving--and hard to imagine Miranda Lambert deserving if he does. I also fall for its opposite number, the Miranda copyright ""Bathroom Sink,"" a crucible her mama taught her to clean at 16--she doesn't like what she sees in the mirror there and doesn't like that she's still fighting with her mama either, but she takes her meds and faces the day. I must also mention ""Platinum,"" about her records and hair, and ""Gravity Is a B**ch,"" about her breasts, thighs, and girlfriends. Nor are the farmed-out sure shots any shorter on sass.

Purportedly a concept album in which Mr. Deeds goes to Nashville because he's outgrown his band, and life will never be the same because fame can do that (also death). Actually a bunch of songs in which Mr. Langford goes to Chicago because he can't stand Margaret Thatcher, and life will never be the same because George W. Bush can do that (also Satan). The ""hard road that always brings you back"" has brought him back to where he once escaped, so now he's considering Switzerland, yodel-ay-ee-oooo.  True love aside, how the hell did he wind up in America? ""The country is young . . . not too good on the sharing,"" so let the zombies tear it apart.  Only he loves its music, which sustains him even in the absence of one of the ad hoc bands he'll never outgrow--the arrangements, early Cash with extras, are as committed as the singing we've learned to assume.

Now, with ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" the official pep song of the daughters of Ms. and Pepsi-Cola and ""Time After Time"" throbbing hearts by the millions, I've softened my strictures about her Betty Boop bimboism--if a kook who's loved, respected, and taken seriously by her sisters fools boys into believing she can be fooled with, more power to her.

From Ann Peebles to Etta Jones, there are dozens of great lost soul divas out there, every one collectible and every one overrated. Lavette resurfaced seriously when she shouted her way into Bubbling Brown Sugar and has inspired a reissue boomlet in elderly nations that don't want to bomb Iraq, but buying the product, even from bettyelavette.com, is impossible. That said, I intend to keep trying. The mad genius of this album is producer-songwriter Dennis Walker, who having long ago sculpted Robert Cray as an obsessed adulterer-cuckold now turns three of the bluesman's male-chauvinist classics into painful cries of victimization and, with help from guitarist Alan Mirikitani, crafts a batch of long-suffering miniatures that make the record. But Lavette makes the songs--though she's gritty and loves to testify, she never overdoes it. What's more, she's got the psychological equilibrium to find optimistic material she can put across just as passionately. That's why Walker sequenced the material to move Lavette toward independence--and wrote the strong-willed title track with a woman.

After her 2003 rebranding with minimalist producer-songwriter Dennis Walker, soul belter turned art singer LaVette got melodramatic on our ass, as old soul belters will. So neither the Brit-rock covers of 2010's Interpretations nor the Grammy fodder of 2015's Worthy speaks for itself with anything approaching the unforced impact of this highly uncanonical Dylan album. Beyond a dubious ""It Ain't Me Babe"" and a startlingly rearranged ""Times They Are A-Changin',"" LaVette's picks are obscure, half of them '80s titles left off both of the compilations since concocted to salvage his lost decade. And ""interpretations"" they're not. Instead LaVette invents a truly new Dylan--a Dylan who's an African-Ameican woman. Sure this Dylan has ""soul""--reservoirs of empathy and spiritual mojo the Dylan we know could only gesture at, cut with a deep seam of the sardonic skepticism that never leaves him alone and finished off with a range, texture, and definition beyond the capabilities of his aging larynx. But the invention goes deeper than that. With R&amp;B master drummer Steve Jordan overseeing an unfailing groove, LaVette messes with the songs at will, not just by changing genders as storylines require--""Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight"" is so different addressed to a man--and introducing the terms ""bullshit"" and ""fucked up"" to Dylan's lexicon, but by swapping and omitting stanzas and updating historical references, Annie Oakley and Belle Starr to Otis Redding and Bruno Mars. The closing ""Going, Going Gone,"" which has no real place on 1973's Planet Waves, darkens the album's political through-line. And in the boldest stroke of all, ""Mama, You Been on My Mind"" addresses not some dumped old lady but this Dylan's mother. LaVette's mother too, sounds like.

FALSE,A,Led Zeppelin IV,Led Zeppelin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2013,"
More even than ""Rock and Roll,"" which led me into the rest of the record (whose real title, as all adepts know, is signified by runes no Underwood can reproduce) months after I'd stupidly dismissed it, or ""Stairway to Heaven,"" the platinum-plated album cut, I think the triumph here is ""When the Levee Breaks."" As if by sorcery, the quasi-parodic overstatement and oddly cerebral mood of Led Zep's blues recastings is at once transcended (that is, this really sounds like a blues), and apotheosized (that is, it has the grandeur of a symphonic crescendo) while John Bonham, as ham-handed as ever, pounds out a contrapuntal tattoo of heavy rhythm. As always, the band's medievalisms have their limits, but this is the definitive Led Zeppelin and hence heavy metal album. It proves that both are--or can be--very much a part of ""Rock and Roll.""

I really like this choirboy manque, which part of me says isn't the point and another says is too. I like how gentle he is, how decent he is, how observant he is, how funny he is. The first three songs on this EP are strong, the fourth misty, the fifth sweet and slight, but all know melody and all fill out a portrait of a young man your daughter should only bring home to mother. He's so talented and caring that when he spends the entirety of the title cut berating himself--laughingly, to an adapted Congolese beat, as he obsesses on a romance gone awry while walking the streets because he doesn't have enough cab money to go cry in bed--it's clearly a temporary setback. Most likable is ""A Promise,"" to a Chilean friend trapped in the toils of Sweden's deteriorating healthcare system. Gothenburg's gotten meaner and he knows it.

FALSE,A,Life Will See You Now,Jens Lekman,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16995,"
Beginning with a Mormon missionary mourning Lady Di and a guy showing his friend a plastic model of his tumor over lunch, Lekman is no longer mooning toward the bland anonymity of his 2012 breakup album. But as with so many great songwriters, his chief concern continues to be love. Usually but not always this means romantic love, although ""How I Tell Him"" cuts that distinction close and those first two songs make you wonder exactly how secular this humanistic Swede might be--the Mormon is envied, the cancer survivor learns his friend was praying for him. From back when he came on like a nicer relation of Stuart Murdoch, Lekman's romanticism and indeed sexuality have always had a lot of agape in it, hinting at social consciousness only insofar as agape is social consciousness's engine and embodiment. I believe that's because he's Swedish. Be grateful there's still a nation where a fellow can preach an ostensibly apolitical humanism with a clear conscience.

Punk poet has never been much of a job description. But on the four albums I've heard, Lennon always makes something of it, and on this 2006 entry he makes everything of it. Recorded when the Celtic Tiger had gotten so mangy anybody who could stand Lennon at all knew he'd seen what was coming, he's full of gleeful scorn whether advising fellow male-pattern baldness sufferers to live with their fate or going off about home invasions again. For 20 tracks he rants on, sometimes tunefully and always unstoppably. He gets everything you'd hope from titles like ""New Land of Syringes"" and ""Nigerians (Stop Giving Out About)."" The matched hymns ""You Must Forgive the Cnts"" and ""You Are No Scumbag"" showcase his spiritual side, and ""S.U.F.Y. Hospitals"" borrows a hook from ""Looking for the Perfect Beat."" All he wants is to keep us out of the circle of shit and help make a better world for Ireland's bruised bananas.

FALSE,A,Plastic Ono Band,John Lennon,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1790,"
Of course the lyrics are often crude psychotherapeutic cliches. That's just the point, because they're also true, and John wants to make clear that right now truth is far more important than subtlety, taste, art, or anything else. At first the music sounds crude, too, stark and even perfunctory after the Beatles' free harmonies and double guitars. But the real music of the album inheres in the way John's greatest vocal performance, a complete tour of rock timbre from scream to whine, is modulated electronically--echoed, filtered, double-tracked, with two vocals sometimes emanating in a synthesis from between the speakers and sometimes dialectically separated. Which means that John is such a media artist that even when he's fervently shedding personas and eschewing metaphor he knows, perhaps instinctively, that he communicates most effectively through technological masks and prisms.

FALSE,A,Imagine,John Lennon,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1791,"
Primal goes pop--personal and useful. The title cut is both a hymn for the Movement and a love song for his wife, celebrating a Yokoism and a Marcusianism simultaneously, and ""Gimme Some Truth"" unites Lennon unmasked with the Lennon of Blunderland wordplay as it provides a rationale for ""Jealous Guy,"" which doesn't need one, and ""How Do You Sleep?,"" which may. ""Oh Yoko!"" is an instant folk song worthy of Rosie &amp; the Originals and ""I Don't Want to Be a Soldier"" an instant folk extravaganza worthy of Phil Spector. ""It's So Hard"" is a blues. ""Crippled Inside,"" with its ""ironic"" good-time ricky-tick, is folk-rock in disguise. And the psychotherapeutically lugubrious ""How?"" is a question mark.

In a special message for all the ignorami who think pretentious bipeds should stay out of recording studios, Yoko keeps up with him. This is an unfashionable piece of music--only Poly Styrene, of all people, has gotten away with anything remotely similar all year.

Those too numbed by tragedy or hope to connect with Double Fantasy aren't likely to hear this one either--it's definitely more of the same, in John's case outtakes. But these were clearly rejected on conceptual rather than musical grounds, as just too quirky to suit the careful househusband image John wanted for his return to the arena. Which is why I like them better, especially spiced with asides he would have erased before final release. Yoko's songs are more recent and that's another plus, because her pop only began to jell with Double Fantasy; the horny querulousness of ""Sleepless Night"" and the cricket synthesizers on ""You're the One"" are confident personal elaborations of a tradition she comes to secondhand. Only the two middle cuts on the B get soupy. What a farewell.

The first album in 30 years by these female militia members, most of whom started making music together in the '60s, and boy have they been saving it up. There's abundance in the three lead vocalists alone: a soprano who slices the air like few African-American counterparts; a near baritone whose hectoring interludes suggest a mom bawling out her kid from an apartment window; and for normality's sake, a rich growler in the big mama mold. Trancey desert guitar patterns are cut by a sour two-sax horn section, sweet chorales offer relief, and they even have tun""Mï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"" the best and last is called, and sweet mother, I believe.

Six years after their last ""true"" album, these much-bruited postpunk brutalists kick off with ""Pots &amp; Pans,"" a song about a much-disparaged band of that name that echoes the Archers of Loaf's Greatest of All Time--the subject of which was ""the world's worst rock 'n' roll band."" ""Pots &amp; Pans"" concerns ""bands that make you sick."" It promises that, in contrast, ""this band's a beating heart and it's nowhere near its end."" And the album that follows puts its melody where its lyric is with the most recognizable set of songs they've ever begrudged their angular guitar bruit. Material's still angular, arranged in the finest postpunk fashion. But now you can hum it--and parse it. Sex riding bareback. Double-barreled homage to ""1999"" (the song) and 2001 (not the movie). Plague song. Death song--well, maybe death-of-love song. Death-of-love song sans ifs or buts. And finally, band-survival song. Dull climax, I agree. But by then, they've come again and again.

In which Kathleen Hanna does the unprecedented--if not, apparently, impossible--and reinvents punk again. The first time seems a snap in retrospect, a straightforward seizure of formal strategy and emotional stance for grrrl rage and female discovery-between Hanna's instinct for the ditty and her big pipes, Bikini Kill was an instant sure shot. But she got too old for that, and maybe a little too fulfilled as well. So having passed through her woebegone Julie Ruin project, she gets together with two arty girlfriends and makes deceptively simple music about her arty life. Topics include aesthetic theory, millenarian hippies, John Cassavetes, the pleasures of the Metro Card, who put the ram in the rama-lama-ding-dong, and ""Hot Topic"" (""Nina Simone!"" ""Ann Peebles!"" ""The Slits!"" ""James Baldwin!"" ""Mia X!"" ""Billy Tipton!"" ""Shirley Muldowney!""). Dynamic synthbeats. Spirited choruses. Even some trick guitar.

The title tune of Lewis's catchiest and finest album lasts eight subtly varied, steadfastly strophic minutes, its only bridge the Williamsburg, which Lewis and his girlfriend cross on foot as he tells her it's over before putting her on the subway back to Brooklyn. Pushing 40 now, this second-generation bohemian knows his turf from ""Scowling Crackhead Ian,"" where the kid who held a knife to his throat in junior high is still befouling St. Marks Place, to ""The Pigeon,"" which stuffs some 30 choice Yiddishisms--""schnorrer,"" ""verkakte,"" ""furshlugginer,"" oy gevalt--into a Poe-parodying Delancey Street anti-gentrification kvetch.

To borrow a keyword from the ""Mule Train"" finale, you could complain that this clippety-clops. Presumably the revised version the liner notes promise will move at a smarter clip, because the drummer who spent a single weekend recording 13 songs she'd met a week before will since then have spent long sticky nights with them on tour. But that's only if the revised version materializes, which cannot be counted a certainty even though 37-year-old stripling Lewis is the least occasional of Stampfel's life list of weird birds. And however shambolic the songs are or aren't, you'll want to hear almost every one anyway. Where to begin? ""All the Time in the World"" redefining immortality? ""Indie Bands on Tour"" redefining folk culture? ""Do You Know Who I Am?! I'm %$&amp;*?in' Snooki!!"" celebrating a reality Stampfel has never really encountered? The Tuli parody, the Stampfel remake, the Patti Page rewrite, the Tommy Jackson lyrics-added, the one that has the 74-year-old Stampfel apologizing that he doesn't ""yet have the skills to write a '64-'65 Beach Boys song""? Put it on shuffle and decide for yourself.

Incredibly enough, this 24-cut double-LP is Lewis's finest US compilation, post-Sun side and all. And though Charly's 20-cut UK Essential Jerry Lee Lewis is clearly the better deal--Rhino's four extra songs, which bring the set to barely an hour and include the intrusive spoken-word novelty ""Return of Jerry Lee,"" will cost you three bucks--I can see why this might be preferred by somebody who wanted to commune with the doomed man in all his multifarious glory. Jerry Lee is and always has been more than just a rock and roller. With a lesser artist, the boogie-woogie ""Saints"" and solo ""Lucky Old Man"" might not mesh, but Lewis makes them his own a lot more convincingly than he does the one-two-three Elvis covers on the Charly disc.

In this company I notice every one. Filthy, corny, classic, omniverous, it's the perfect complement to 18 Original Greatest Hits. And almost as essential.

Assembled from two shows recorded in one night in 1964, released in Europe shortly thereafter but in the U.S. not till a 1986 Mercury LP that's barely a rumor, this legendary 37-minute performance is our last and clearest glimpse of Jerry Lee as a young world-beater. Not only has he bulled his way past the incest 'n' bigamy tour of 1958 and the drowning death of his son in 1962, he's some kind of hero in a Europe rediscovering '50s rock and roll via Beatlemania. Without cracking the charts or drawing crowds commensurate with his ego on the endless tour that is his life, he believes so profoundly in his pact with the devil that he remains unbowed. Here that faith is both made manifest and recorded for posterity, which otherwise never happened on the same night. Admirers attribute this ungodly miracle to one emotional resource or other, but I find Lewis so impenetrable psychologically that I hesitate to put a name on it. Instead I'll list a few technical attributes. Both performance and recording are very clean. Tempos are speedy, and the backing band--the Nashville Teens of ""Tobacco Road"" renown--keep up manfully. ""Mean Woman Blues"" and ""Money"" are definitive. And the piano kills.

After transforming Leroy Brown into a Memphis motherhumper who stomps all over Jim Croce's stupid cartoon and wears the tatters around his neck like a victory garland, he rewrites a Moon Mullican blues, matches a 50s Chuck Berry medley with a 50s Teresa Brewer-Hugo Winterhalter medley, covers a humble Fanny Crosby hymn and a schlocky Mickey Gilley hit, posits a humble country hit of his own, and--after anointing America's first fulltime professional songwriter ""one of the greats of all time"" along with Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, and Al Jolson theirself--goes out on the greatest weeper Stephen Foster ever wept. His piano pumping irrepressibly, Jerry Lee defines his musical identity in the middle of the night with nobody listening: a stylist who can't stop rocking.

Forget all the well-meaning comparisons to good bands present and especially past. Every guitar-based four-piece with enough sidelong flair and I-don't-care gets those nowadays, and these Londoners have more talent and panache than most if not all of them. They're plenty songful if you give them half a chance, which is hard because they conceal such a bewildering wealth of compositional tactics within a fast, loose, lyrical, vulnerable sound that's their own even if they've never given it a moment's thought which is what the sound wants you to think, and which I very much doubt.

The evolution of Formerly Kleenex from punk primitives to postpunk postprimitives proceeds as if God planned it, without dead ends or maladaptations. They burst out with some of the funniest jump-up-and-down ditties ever to jolly bohemians into dancing. Then they mellow, musing sinuously without losing their feminism or their sense of humor. They remain my favorite girl band of all time. And their sound effects are a universal language.

But from the off-time stammer that intros ""Intro""--one of my favorite moments on one of my favorite tracks on the double-CD I now possess in two-and-a-half slightly different versions--rarely has pop excess been so ebullient, or do I mean pop ebullience been so excessive?

And if they don't exactly rhyme, the best rapper alive will squoosh around until they do--that series proceeds from ""grill on,"" ""ceilin',"" and ""keep it real on."" Does he make it up as he goes along, as is claimed? Could be, because his words have little to do with storytelling or any other species of coherence. They are among other things silly, which bodes ill for his reputation on the so-called street--the Reality Police know that his guns, cocaine, pimping, murdering, etc. are the formal play of a beat jacker who at 24 has spent half his life as a professional musician.

Shifting abruptly from funk to skronk to varying intensities of Brazilian pop, this may seem scattered to some, but I find its coherence riveting. I suppose what holds it together is Arto's persona--really more a sensibility, postmodernist humor coexisting with humanistic lyricism, which is articulated rhythmically but also in singing that ranges from look-ma crazee to wittingly sweet and unaffected. In this context both his fake-gibberish verbal-vocalese and his surprisingly detailed atonal strums (not his lyrics) sound like translations from the Portuguese.

All the hits (and as similar as they are, you wouldn't want to miss one), plus for context jump blues his (not necessarily superior) way. The pace isn't as breakneck as it seemed in the '50s. In the '50s, though, there was no soul music that knew its name, and for all his frantic ambition and rock and roll fame, this godchild was telling us about it.

This takes generic to a whole different level. Where their EP was a straightforward account of a world-class bar band in command of what we'll call Chicano r&amp;b, a relatively specialized indigenous style with unexploited mass potential, their debut LP makes it sound as if they invented the style. Who did the original of that one, you wonder, only to discover that you're listening to the original. Listen a little more and you figure out that these slices of dance music have lyrics, lyrics rooted in an oppression the artists really know about--the love songs return incessantly to the separation that defines migrant laborers' lives. And from the moment you hear ""I Got Loaded"" you'll know that while Cesar Rosas is merely a generic singer in the best sense, David Hidalgo is some kind of tenor.

Result: Latin Playboys, impressionistic fragments coalescing into a self-sustaining aural counterreality. And although this return to their primary identity masquerades manfully as an arena-ready song collection, neither the one about rain nor the one about trains convinces me they'll ever revert. From enchanted-island salsa to Santana solo, from revolutionary disillusion to feeling happy anyway, their infinitely absorptive eclecticism feels blessed rather than bombarded. They're not dealing with it, they're digging it. And if you're as big as they are you will too.

Add a weakness for marketable seminovelties and I'll take a newly reissued 36-minute 1956 debut whose hard, sad, simple tales are neither bedizened by Mammon nor drenched in Jesus, although they certainly welcome their Calvinist fate. Traditional ballads are matched with venerable pop fakes and newly minted sob stories, including the Louvins' own account of a seven-year-old who offers up all his toys and pennies to prevent his chosen lifemate, the daughter of the migrant workers next door, from moving on. Stark, beautiful, and imbued with an intensity of belief that will eat your sense of camp for breakfast.

FALSE,A,The Best of Dorothy Love-Coates & the Gospel Harmonettes,Dorothy Love-Coates & the Gospel Harmonettes,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6038,"
Although Coates's rough-cut contralto steers her away from the stately professions of faith that bog down Mahalia Jackson and Marion Williams, the honorable Specialty best-of from her '50s glory days is still somewhat homogenized by its own humility. Captured here in the late '60s, she's wilder and faster, with plenty of guitar-organ-percussion augmenting the churchy piano. In short, she rocks. With the Harmonettes shouting, testifying, and showing off their high notes, the total effect is as awesome as any God-fearer could hope.

FALSE,A,Spider Jiving,Andy Fairweather Low,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=115,"
In which the voice of (ta-ra) the Amen Corner rocks more convincingly than he ever did as an English-r&amp;b teen throb and still somehow sounds laid-back. The secret is a rough-hewn spontaneity in which the guitar and bass that meet the Memphis Horns over an insistent but very unfunky 4/4 are both acoustic, in which Charlie McCoy plays hornpipe harp over oompah drums. The lean, direct, catchy, introspective lyrics work the same way; their substance--that is, their obsessive but unassuming speculation about man's fate--is bound up in their free use of verbatim borrowings from a common language. Apotheosis: the slyly hermeneutic ""Dancing in the Dark,"" in which a discreet fatalism is shaped by courtly music-hall tune and elegant soft-shoe timing.
"
FALSE,A,Be Bop 'n' Holla,Andy Fairweather Low,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=116,"
Andy's up to his old tricks. With the help of some lilting Caribbean-style percussion, as infectious as Victoria II, he abandons the attack that's always put a hard edge on his cheerful rock and roll. The result is a tuneful, sexy album, and oh so frivolous--""Lighten Up"" sounds like a theme song. But frivolity turns desperate when you listen hard: in the theme song, for instance, Andy identifies himself as a stranger, a slave, and a prisoner to his lonely grave. Such a joker, this boy--makes it sound like Rocky Raccoon had it coming to him.

FALSE,A,Pure Pop for Now People,Nick Lowe,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2568,"
This is an amazing pop tour-de-force demonstrating that if the music is cute enough the words can be any old non-cliche. Lowe's people cut off their right arms, castrate Castro, love the sound of breaking glass, roam with alligators in the heart of the city, and go to see the Bay City Rollers. But because the hooks cascade so deftly, I care about every one of them. As for Lowe, this Inspirational Verse: ""She was a winner/Who became a doggie's dinner/She never meant that much to me.""
"
FALSE,A,Labour of Lust,Nick Lowe,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2569,"
The title is more than a (great) joke--this album is consciously carnal, replete with girls who come in doses, tits that won't quit, lumps in the pocket, and extensions that aren't Alexander Bell's invention. With Rockpile backing, it's also more straight-ahead than Pure Pop. This is nice--my favourite line is ""I don't think it's funny no more""--but it does nothing to stop Lowe from falling into cliches like ""Without Love,"" which ought to be funny and isn't. But then again on the other hand that's probably the point.

Generalizing the hostile ""Shove"" with the balls-to-the-wall ""Fast and Frightening,"" dissecting everybody else's suicidal tendencies on ""Deathwish"" before joining the fun on ""'Till the Wheels Fall Off,"" humping a ""Broomstick"" as a preamble to ""Packin' a Rod,"" these clitocentric trouble girls are everything the Runaways were supposed to be. Afraid of nothing including the four-syllable F-word, they go for an obsessive, dirty, punk pop-metal so aggressive it'll scare damn near every sister in sight. But the bravest will grow stronger. Soon they'll tell others. And start their own bands. And conquer the world. Right?

FALSE,A,Bricks Are Heavy,L7,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1977,"
Once again Butch Vig's mission is to smelt speed-sludge into grunge-metal alloy, which with this band involves intense admixtures of ditty and power chord. Although the passion of their major-label stab may not match Nirvana's, it's just as catchy and a touch nastier. Driven onward by the quick and muscular Dee Plakas, their buzzing textures and heavy hooks are streamlined rather than softened or dulled even if they don't accelerate like on last year's thrash longform. Read-my-title outbursts like ""Wargasm,"" ""Diet Pill,"" and ""Shitlist"" fulfill the ancient prophecy of a time when gurls would reinvent punk out of sheer delight in their own power. Grrrls will be grrrls.

""If the war is over/And the monsters have won/If the war is over/I'm gonna have me some fun,"" confides born noncombatant Dean Wareham, whose only recorded partisan act is rooting for Nixon to expire. Wareham creates his music from the vantage of a slacker of independent means. Once darkness falls, all Manhattan (or Tacoma, Brussels, wherever he gets to tour) is his playground. But he spends most of his life in what sure sounds like a high-rise, where he drinks in the afternoon, wheedles his good-for-nothing girlfriends, studies his record collection, and cooks up guitar parts. Being as he's discovered the Go-Betweens, that seems like redeeming social value enough for me.

FALSE,A,The Very Best of Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers,Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1285,"
Lymon's oeuvre is less mythic than he is. Forced to sit through his Bear Family box, adepts luxuriate in nostalgia or read trauma and triumph into every piece of crap George Goldner handed him while outsiders smile indulgently at his una-poppa-cow or kvell about a New York street music better understood as a democratic multiplicity. Fact is, the 16-song package is kinder than the 20-track it condenses. Lymon possessed the strongest instrument of any young teenager on record, including Tanya Tucker, Arlene Smith, Brenda Lee, LeAnn Rimes, and Michael Jackson himself. Aware that this little kid was a pimp before he got fucked on the hit parade, we can hear the knowingness of the voice's innocence as both thrilling and chilling. But note as well how much his street music owes the showbiz razzmatazz every teenager of the time encountered on radio and television but few were canny enough to put to use. Then we should admit that on the few pieces of B material here, he's just reading his lines, stuck in a rut that can't accommodate his drive to rise above. And then we'll try and forget all that, as Lymon had to if his records were to make any sense as the teen dreams they were and remain.

FALSE,A,Country Music Hall of Fame Series,Loretta Lynn,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5991,"
She's not quite the singer Patsy was and Tammy theoretically remains, but her sense of self is more archetypal--deep country without Patsy's jazzy detours, male-identified without Tammy's sultry masochism. When she was flying she wrote her own songs, the feistiest (and best) the politically incorrect ""Fist City"" (biff-bam-boom, sister) and ""Your Squaw Is on the Warpath"" (his metaphor, she revels in it). But the borrowed marital laments of her decline--""After the Fire Is Gone,"" ""When the Tingle Becomes a Chill,"" and Shel Silverstein's eternal ""One's on the Way""--sound lived in. That can happen when you get hitched at 13, have four kids before you're 20, take off at 26 with a song that goes ""Success has made a failure of our home,"" and stand by your man.

FALSE,A,Pronounced Leh'-nerd Skin'-nerd,Lynyrd Skynyrd,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2188,"
Lacking both hippie roots and virtuosos, post-Allmanites like ZZ Top, Marshall Tucker, and Wet Willie become transcendently boring except when they get off a good song. But in this staunchly untranscendent band, lack of virtuosos is a virtue, because it inspires good songs, songs that often debunk good-old-boy shibboleths. Examples: ""Poison Whiskey,"" ""Mississippi Kid,"" and ""Gimme Three Steps,"" whee Ronnie Van Zant, instead of outwitting the dumb redneck the way onetime Dylan sideman Charlie Daniels does in ""Uneasy Rider,"" just hightails it out of there. Savvy production from onetime Dylan sideman Al Kooper.
"
FALSE,A,Street Survivors,Lynyrd Skynyrd,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2191,"
Some rock deaths are irrelevant, while others make a kind of sense because the artists involved so obviously long to transcend (or escape) their own mortality. But for Ronnie Van Zant, life and mortality were the same thing--there was no way to embrace one without at least keeping company with the other. So it makes sense that ""That Smell"" is the smell of death, or that in ""You Got That Right"" Van Zant boasts that he'll never be found in an old folks' home. As with too many LPs by good road bands, each side here begins with two strong cuts and then winds down. The difference is that the two strong cuts are very strong and the weak ones gain presence with each listen. I'm not just being sentimental. I know road bands never make their best album the sixth time out, and I know Van Zant had his limits. But I mourn him not least because I suspect that he had more good music left in him than Bing and Elvis put together.

Because Ronnie Van Zant wasn't quite an infallible songwriter, Lynyrd Skynyrd was a great band that never made a wholly undeniable album, but try saying no to this compilation and it'll loosen your bicuspids. It's not fair, really--everybody who was dumb enough to dismiss them as another pack of redneck boogie freaks now gets to catch up. Though I can hope that when they do they'll be consumed with regret at what they missed. And I can't deny that when I want to hear Skynyrd this is what I'll put on.

Although his albums work fine as units, this cherry-pick cements Tokyo-born rapper Tom Shimura's demographically improbable standing as--with the exception of the elusive D'Angelo, I guess--the finest trad-funk vocalist of the new century. True, he lacks the black South chocolate that would normally flavor such an offhand drawl and relaxed flow--his very male timbre is more redolent of a northern office grunt shooting the shit over a six o'clock beer. But his cadences make the music move. Shimura's true place of origin is Berkeley, which would locate his politics if he didn't believe that in hip-hop, wisecracking middle-class critical realism is ideology aplenty. Instead, his home city has nurtured in him a taste in beats that at its best recalls both Boots Riley and Too Short. It's an East Bay thing, so try to understand.

There are no doubt hundreds of frustrated chorines who could sing the three Sondheim originals ""better"" than the most famous person in the world. But with its pedigree of wit and musicality, show-tune pop-schlock sure beats the direct-to-Vegas power ballads with which she's heretofore betrayed her dance-rock roots. Especially when she writes it herself--except for the ""Material Girl""-inspired ""More,"" the Sondheim tunes are fussy and genteel (with Mandy Patinkin's ""well-sung"" cameo the nadir), but such fake period pieces as ""Cry Baby,"" ""He's a Man,"" and the risque s&amp;m-lite ""Hanky Panky"" are all her. This is a woman whose great gift is for the mask. Camp isn't everything she can do, but she sure knows how to do it right.

OK, everybody, let's use our imaginations, shall we? It may be a little hard at first, but if we try we can have lots of fun. To start, let's pretend that we have nothing against dance music--that instead of fixating on impersonal and mechanical and all those obvious things we can just enjoy it for what it is, as innocently as babes. Come on now, really try. Got it? Good. Because now I'm going to suggest something even harder--that we pretend we've never heard of Madonna. I know that's like asking you not to think of a purple polar bear, so just pretend to pretend, if you know what I mean, which as good postmodernist children you do. Now, put the record on. Hear those bass and synth beats? Sinuous and subtle and sexy, aren't they? How 'bout the faux-Arab electro on ""Words""? And aren't the techno effects all nice and cheesy-futuristic? The singer doesn't have great pipes, but because she's too hip to belt (this time), she doesn't need them. She's in control, all understated presence and impersonal personality except when she's flashing some pink. Also, not counting that ""Love your sister, love your brother"" thing, the lyrics are not stupid. I love the rap where the boast turns out to be a lie. And whoever thought of recording the breakup song through the phone hookup was pretty smart, wasn't he or she? She, I bet. A find.

FALSE,A,Music,Madonna,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2211,"
Anybody who denies that Madonna made great singles in the '80s is a boob. Run all together on The Immaculate Collection, they constitute the greatest album of her mortal life. But except for the debut, the albums per se from that period strove for schlock when they didn't stoop to filler. In the early '90s, she essayed great longforms--an ambition that presupposes good songs while cultivating consistency and flow. Then she got scared and discovered God, two not unrelated experiences that rendered her great singles and good songs more middlebrow. So rejoice that from Vocoder to cowgirl suit, she's got her sass back. Pretending to be cheap, she sometimes--as on my favorite moment, the processed-munchkin hook of the perfectly entitled ""Nobody's Perfect""--really is cheap, which is essential to the illusion. All the songs are good, all chintzy. Which combo provides just the right consistency and flow.

Because this time the object of Stephin Merritt's formal affection is rock 'n' roll noise, there's always a whiff of crude emotion in the deliberately simple tunes he's fitted to the task. The joke songs about topless nuns and zigzagging drag queens are as humanizing in their way as the tales of lost love one might take literally if someone else was singing them (which sometimes someone else is: Miss Shirley Simms). Whether he's wallowing putrescently with his zombie boy or dreaming alone in his soul-death monotone, Merritt's commitment to vernacular genres, the joke included, seems warm compared to the mix-and-match subgenre-splitting even the most lyrical young indie types don't know better than. The sly bastard believes in love after all. He's made a novelty record that gets deeper with time.

I used to regard Taj as a walking Afro-musical encyclopedia, but the more I listened to this endlessly listenable anthology the less derivative he seemed. Nobody else has ever sung blues this way--cutting rural slack with urban hyperconsciousness, he's Jim Crow's bumpkin turning into Zip Coon's dandy without the negative vibe of either stereotype. Sly and cocky, but so full of fun you don't resent it, he sneaks beats from all over the diaspora under these mostly classic tunes as he shows off the effortless size and avidity of his voice and the National steel-bodied and acoustic 12-string he tiptoes out with.

Though the box is too much as usual, rest assured that none of his albums have gotten worse. But since not everyone's a natural sucker for John Hurt's love child moved down to New Orleans and taken up with a St. Kitts woman, here's where to find out how much you care. Five of 17 songs are also on the paradigm-shifting 1992 comp Taj's Blues, which also begins (and why not?) with ""Statesboro Blues"" and ""Leaving Trunk."" But starting with 1969's The Natch'l Blues, say, would mean missing, to name just two, Dave Dudley's Teamster-certified ""Six Days on the Road"" and the Pointer Sisters' sashaying backup on ""Cakewalk Into Town."" Don't die without hearing that one. It's reason to live all by itself.

FALSE,A,The Inner Mounting Flame,Mahavishnu Orchestra/John McLaughlin,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2218,"
He couldn't very well call it the John McLaughlin Lifetime, but that's what it is--with Billy Cobham a somewhat heavier Tony Williams, Rick Laird subbing for fellow Scot Jack Bruce, violinist Jerry Goodman and keyboard man Jan Hammer vainly filling in Khalid Yasin's organ textures, and McLaughlin back on electric guitar. The raveups aren't quite as intense as ""Right On,"" though ""Awakening"" and ""The Noonward Race"" come close, but McLaughlin has a much clearer idea of how to make a rock band work than Williams. No vocals is the right idea--imagine what claptrap he'd come up with putting the beyond into words. To change pace he provides more of the noble, elemental themes he introduced on Devotion--my favorite is ""The Dance of Maya,"" which breaks into a blues about halfway through. Mistake: ""A Lotus on Irish Streams,"" a lyrical digression featuring Goodman, who ought to be watched closely at all times.

He no longer sings as goatishly or as much, which is a loss, but until someone compiles his best-of, this will be proof he deserves one. The songs are new, many with far from embarrassing English verses and hooks you swear you've heard before, but it's production values that make it his first export album to soar. Soukous audio gives the beat bite. Strong support--not just Makgona Tsohle and the Queens, but West Nkosi second-stringers Amaswazi Emvelo--helps carry that weight. And I bet they took the time to get it right, too--blessed by the relief of a European tour, they waited till the spirit was more than willing.

FALSE,A,Greatest Hits,The Mamas and the Papas,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3699,"
As with such contemporary jazz and folk harmonists as the Hi-Los and Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, the pretensions of their elaborate schlock were strictly vocal. Rather than a wall of sound for them to emote over, Lou Adler had the Tycoon of Teen's studio studs construct a latticework for them to wend through, with strings generally left out, mixed down, or reduced to chamber music. Another corn corrective was John Phillips's detached, often acid songwriting--cf. the gentle rake's confession ""I Saw Her Again,"" or this collection's sole serious omission, the cheerful junkie boast ""Straight Shooter."" Phillips got romantic only as a California dreamer, most tellingly in the late, commercially minor ""Twelve Thirty,"" a benign description of how groovy it felt to leave New York for L.A. circa 1966. Its sense of stoned entitlement on show business's hippie fringe evokes a utopian moment too many '60s memoirists have forgotten or never knew.

Influenced by the Beatles, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, the Hi-Los, and invisible demons who crept up on them when they didn't score the right drugs, the M&amp;Ps were as sick as they were slick, and although this could accommodate more dark secrets, it proves how sharply their nonhits stick. Their elaborate harmonies and lattice-of-sound arrangements sound super-innocuous until you notice the love bad love of ""Got a Feelin'"" and ""Go Where You Wanna Go,"" the plastic-hippie savvy of ""Creeque Alley"" and ""Twelve-Thirty,"" the junkie come-on of ""Straight Shooter"" and the narco tips of ""Free Advice"" (""Vice, vice""). They play ""Do You Wanna Dance"" as sweet romance, ""Twist and Shout"" as lubricious slow jam, ""The 'In' Crowd"" as vicious elitism. They do show tunes. They do Shirley Temple and ersatz Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross. They do one of the greatest Beatles covers ever.

No crib sheets accompany these six circa-1983 tracks, but I gather they're less propagandistic than the wartime output of this rock-influenced Zimbabwean singer turned Mugabe partisan, which given his main man's Shona chauvinism is probably a good thing. What I'm sure is that they generate a ferocious groove--the rhythm guitar attack of Mapfumo's Black Unlimited band never slacks off, maintaining the indomitable uprush of great African pop well past its usual fading point. You think music ""transcends"" politics? Then get this sucker.

You'd figure the loss of vocal and songwriting input from Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston would be crippling, and reggae melodies being what they are that's the way I heard it at first. But the I-Threes pitch in like comrades rather than backup (can the Blackberries or the Sweet Inspirations claim the same?), and while the material has thinned out slightly I'm sure there are guys in Kingston who would kill for Marley's rejects. ""No Woman, No Cry,"" a masterpiece on the order of ""Trench Town Rock"" or ""I Shot the Sheriff,"" encourages him to bend and burr his sharp timbre until it's lyrical and incisive both at once. Lyrical and incisive--that's the combo.

FALSE,A,Legend,Bob Marley & the Wailers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=393,"
This painstaking package captures everything that made Marley an international hero--his mystical militance, his sex appeal, his lithe, transported singing and sharp, surprising rhythms. And oh yes, his popcraft, which places him in the pantheon between James Brown and Stevie Wonder. Though he had a genius for fashioning uncommon little themes out of everyday chords, he was no tunesmith--""No Woman No Cry"" and ""Redemption Song"" could be said to have full-fledged melody lines, but from ""Is This Love"" to ""Jamming"", most of these gems are hooky chants. Which given his sharp, surprising rhythms only makes them catchier--play either seven-cut side twice before bedtime and you won't know where to start humming next morning.

Where Diana Ross and Martha Reeves pumped personality, Gladys Horton (prettily gritty, as in ""Please Mr. Postman"") and Wanda Young (neatly sweet, as in ""Don't Mess With Bill"") took the Shirley Owens Everygirl Pledge. They were role players--proud but demure, neither pushover nor showoff. Twenty-eight of these 42 songs can be found on the old Anthology comp, including all the great ones (although not ""Paper Boy"": ""Since the name of your paper is the Free Press/Give me one and you can sell the rest""). But Mr. Gordy wouldn't countenance a bad song--not on a 45, anyway--and unlike Diana and Martha, Gladys and Wanda were always amenable to letting Smokey or Holland-Dozier-Holland put words in their mouths. Which enabled them to lead or front Motown's only true girl group--except for Shirley's Shirelles, the best anywhere.

FALSE,A,Thelonious Sphere Monk,Mast,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17266,"
The only jazzman whose compositions have racked up more cover versions than Monk's is Ellington, who copyrighted over 2000 tunes. Monk's life total was 70. Think about that for a second. Counted too weird, too blunt, too ham-fisted, too trinkle-tinkle, too spacey, too nutty, Monk was a melodist of genius. But beyond ""'Round Midnight,"" most of his covers are jazz covers; even Hal Willner's lost 1984 tribute That's the Way I Feel Now legitimized its Shockabilly and Joe Jackson sallies by giving equal time to Steve Lacy and Barry Harris. This sound-collage is different. Masterminded by techno-friendly LA guitarist Tim Conley, it performs the magic of refreshing a catalogue that's eternally new to begin with--just when you're wondering what's up, in sidles ""Misterioso"" or ""Evidence"" or ""Epistrophy"" or ""Blue Monk"" or ""Let's Cool One"" or ""Nutty"" itself. Rather than desecrating these timeless classics that were once too weird for words, the bleeps and electro-textures prove the melodies' mettle. Nor is Conley above strings or horns or playing a few of these beauties himself. Does it, er, swing? The answer, as it should be, is sometimes.

Although I slotted this Soweto-raised 27-year-old's 2010 Mshini Wam as promising kwaito electro, I never imagined it promised a hip-hop record so dark it reveals his labelmate Shabazz Palaces for the arty pothead we can assume he is. Contra the nervous crits who claim to hear a ""palpable feeling of hope"" or ""summery highlife melodies"" (highlife, eh? I've heard of that--African, right?), even the sweet opener about the sexual maturation of a guy who was feeling it before his pubes came in ends ominously. After that come evocations of oppression only more brutal because they're sometimes dissociated--blood diamonds, why we hate our crap jobs, the deadening surrender of the tricking American hip-hop makes light of. The music suits because it's also dissociated--beaty enough to keep your foot tapping and your subconscious involved, but devoid of the escapist joy that is the miracle of so much Afropop produced from equally horrendous daily struggles.

South African pop moves cozy up to African American notions of sophistication, and South African pan-Africanist moves graft a fabricated tradition onto a musical history with no parallel in Africa or anywhere else. Mbuli's fusions are more visionary and more local. Singing or chanting mostly in English or Zulu but occasionally in Xhosa or Venda, his relaxed, pantribal township jive owes all the urban South African styles--mbaqanga, kwela, marabi, even a little mbube. It's pop on South Africa's own terms, too swinging for retro and too jumpy for slick. What's more, this man didn't start out as a musician--like Linton Kwesi Johnson, he's just a poet who loves music enough to do it right. Although he's not as learned as LKJ, his songs are as complete a tour of the apartheid struggle as you're likely to get without reading--and his lyric sheet is a good place to begin.

Like most beatmasters, Vancouver's finest thrives with a partner, and although local legend Birdapres pitches in on music as well as words, it's really the collaborator's spirit and reach that make this a find. Effectively, McEnroe's Disenfranchised was a concept album about the indie-rock business. Still defiantly scenebound, this is a party record for people so determined to pursue their own idea of fun they're ready to go back to their j-o-b's on a buck-and-a-half's sleep. Bush and his war and even his economy loom over these Canadian pleasures, but that permeable border affords psychological protection--the beats are danceable in practice as well as theory, and there's no sense of hiding from grim reality.

Rarely has the homely been rendered with such delicate sophistication: these women spend sixty or seventy grand trying to make a studio approximate a living room, or maybe a church basement on production numbers, and succeed! They are prim, wry, and sexy all at once, with a fondness for family life as it is actually lived--a repository of strength, surely, but also a repository of horrors--that is reflected in their version of folk instrumentation. Rather than on-the-road guitars (with their attendant corn about the wimmin at home) they rely on accordion, piano, organ; once when they need a drum they get the kind of oompah beat you still hear in parades. Even better than the debut, albeit harder.

FALSE,A,Tell My Sister,Kate & Anna McGarrigle,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15392,"
Since these ""demos and unreleased recordings 1971-1974"" are part of a superbly designed and moderately priced little box that also includes their extraordinary Warner Bros. albums of 1976 and 1977, I should specify that my grade is for the bonus disc, which although it includes only five titles unavailable in later versions is one of the most useful I know. Much as I love the debut, its intelligent gloss is no longer needed to put the music across; on the demos, spare piano highlights voices we now know to be delectable without the subtlest sweetening. Proudly selling herself, Kate especially is more forthright and less cunning--and also, poignantly, younger. In a few cases--I'd name ""Kiss &amp; Say Goodbye,"" ""Tell My Sister,"" and ""Blues in E""--the demos are even preferable. Special thanks too for Chaim Tannenbaum's unheard ""Annie."" And then there's the great prize: Kate's newly unearthed ""Saratoga Summer Song,"" a fond, funny, ruefully dissolute chronicle of a hippie summer that casually epitomizes both concepts--not just ""hippie,"" but ""summer.""

FALSE,A,Normal as Blueberry Pie: A Tribute to Doris Day,Nellie McKay,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14751,"
Though I wish I believed McKay would have discovered Day if the 87-year-old box office queen hadn't devoted half her adult life to animal rights, the spritz, groove, sweetness and delight of this project not only raise Day from the shallow grave of the camp canon but give McKay a chance to grow up without going all sententious or stodgy. If by some mischance she's contracted the writer's block that can afflict kids who've spent years unable to staunch the river of new songs within--the only original is one of the few forgettables--then McKay has a future as an interpreter. At first the jazzy lightness of her arrangements seems like a distortion. But when you compare Day's ""Crazy Rhythm"" or ""Do Do Do""--even the radio transcription of ""Sentimental Journey"" or a ""Wonderful Guy"" so much less brassy than Mary Martin's--you remember that like every Cincinnati girl of her era Day grew up with swing and probably resented the orchestral overkill she was saddled with. McKay's covers are jazzier and kookier than anything Day would have dared, or wanted. But to borrow language she's used for Day, they're ""uncluttered, sensual and free, driven by an irrepressible will to live.""

FALSE,A,Devotion,John McLaughlin,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1798,"
McLaughlin reminds me as much of Duane Eddy as of John Coltrane--he loves electric noise for its own sake and rocks more naturally than he swings. Here Buddy Miles provides his usual ham-handed thump, a universe away from Tony Williams's sallies, and McLaughlin just marches along on top, his tone supremely heavy by choice. But like Coltrane, though in a much more detached way, he can get enormous mileage out of harmonic ideas whose simplicity is probably one source of the spirituality he generates. Rarely has a rock improvisation been more basic or more thoughtfully conceived than on the little track, where he and Larry Young trade the same elemental motif for so long it turns into an electric mantra.
"
FALSE,A,Complicated Game,James McMurtry,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16332,"
McMurtry has the musical limitations you'd expect of a singer-songwriter whose loud declaratives pound away over a beat designed for a guy who ""can't dance a lick."" But this time you should definitely live with them--of the dozen songs on his first album since 2008, the two that are less than compelling come close, and half are superb. The struggling-class portraiture this Texan makes his specialty relocates to South Dakota, Virginia, Florida, and comfier Long Island, whence an Oklahoman salaryman reports: ""When the 5:30 rush hits the Cross Island Parkway/It's not for the squeamish or the gentle of heart."" One of the four love songs painfully rekindles an old flame, while the rest address a single fine piece of work: a handy bartender who writes better prose than the writer she loves and who, as per an agreement the writer never thought would go into effect, makes do with a Harley-riding parking lot attendant while he's away on tour. Two others reflect on the singer's existential inadequacies, including is a finale called ""Cutter"" I find less than compelling only when I can't feel the knife focusing the pain in one spot so I can get to sleep.

""I got a shirt that cost a dollar twenty-five/I know that I'm the best-dressed man alive,"" sings the same goof--well, sounds more like his brother, but only their mom cares--who gets lost on the freeway/in the breezeway and escapes Satan's lake of fire in a swimming hole that sounds like heaven itself. How did music so resilient bubble out of the desert wastes? How did music so sweet top hardcore mess? No one ever accused them of reliability, but in this astutely compiled account, having established their noisy principles and done ""Tumblin' Tumbleweeds"" as Sid's ""My Way,"" they never touch the ground. Amerindie at its most blessed.

FALSE,A,The Mekons Rock 'n' Roll,The Mekons,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3713,"
If you love rock and roll (which is possible even if you slum the spelling with apostrophes), but don't think Rock and Roll (much less Rock 'n' Roll) a propitious title right now, you could love this album, which takes their love-hate relationship with America to the bank. Musically, it's rock and roll despite the fiddles sawing louder than ever, almost as Clashlike as the promo claims, with Steve Goulding bashing away louder than ever too. Lyrically, in great song after great song, rock and roll is devil's-breath perfume, capitalism's ""favourite boy child,"" a commodity like sex, a log to throw on the fire, a ""shining path back to reconquer Americay."" Are they implicated? Of course. Do they love it? Yes and no.

FALSE,A,Original Sin,The Mekons,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3712,"
Fear and Whiskey was a triumph in search of a war, and even their fans lost the two EPs that followed in the shuffle. Minus a Merle Haggard cover and plus two other cuts, one of which stinks just in case you mistook them for great artists, all this product comes together on this remastered repackage, and it coheres wonderfully--the EPs resonate off an album that doesn't leave you hungering for something completely different when its thirty-five minutes are through. If you're among the millions who missed Fear and Whiskey, this is a golden opportunity. These guys know how to make the most of failure. That's the kind of anarchist revolutionaries I like.

FALSE,A,OOOH!,The Mekons,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11552,"
Their best album in a decade doesn't exactly come up and give you a kiss. Half 9-11 fallout, half night thoughts of a band whose heyday is past, it begins with what seems a faux-folk trope until you realize that ""Thee Olde Trip to Jerusalem"" is also the new crusade, and ends with the impassive boast, ""We pride ourselves that our memory/Will vanish from the memory of the world."" It's slow, sour, dark, grim--obsessed with treachery, conflagration, and death. For years the Time Out of Mind fan club has been finding unfathomable fatalism in folk songs that rarely gather the grounded gravity sustained here. Inspirational Verse (really, think about it): ""Everyday is a battle/How we still love the war.""

FALSE,A,Memphis Jug Band,Memphis Jug Band,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11699,"
Will Shade didn't invent jug bass, which began in Louisville, but he sure professionalized it, leading an aggregation whose shifting cast of dozens recorded more than 60 tracks between 1927 and 1934. On the pop side, leaving the likes of Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman out of it, they were the best small group in America before Louis Jordan's Tympany Five: prophetic going-up-the-city worldview, crowd-pleasing songbag of happy hokum and well-remembered folk tunes, infectious beat, and drolly soulful singers, topped by lowdown party girl Hattie Hart. But this former double LP, reduced in its reprogrammed 1991 digital version from 28 to 23 tracks, is a fine place to begin even if it skips the seminal bait track of Yazoo's recent and redundant The Best of the Memphis Jug Band, ""Memphis Shakedown,"" which in turn omits both ""Lindberg Hop,"" which leads this CD, and the metathematic ""The Old Folks Started It."" Haphazard-on-purpose Yazoo guarantees, however, that you'd be better off with several of the five omissions, especially ""I'll See You in the Spring, When the Birds Begin to Sing,"" which leads the vinyl version, and the spelunking tragedy ""Cave Man Blues."" It's enough to make me mention the well-selected, budget-priced double-18-track of Classic Blues' The Essential Memphis Jug Band sound quality unheard.

FALSE,A,Song X,Pat Metheny/Ornette Coleman,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2675,"
I've always regarded Metheny as a harmless, well-meaning talent whose interests are as far from mine as, I don't know, Nino Rota's. It was nice that he admired Ornette, but his jazz was still way too tame. Well, never mind--this collaboration is the best pure jazz album Coleman's made since I started keeping track in the early '70s. No rock moves, and no funk, harmolodic or otherwise--it's all sweet lyricism, sonic comedy, and headlong invention. Metheny obviously doesn't deserve top billing, but he holds his own, especially on guitar synth, where his duet responses, ensemble parts, and choo-choo noises all fit in. And while rhythm stalwarts Charlie Haden and Jack DeJohnette make everything swinging, it's Metheny's taming effect that keeps the music in trim.

FALSE,A,Song X: Twentieth Anniversary,Pat Metheny/Ornette Coleman,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12964,"
Right, the same damn jazz album--same damn fine jazz album--he/they released in 1986. Only the 18 minutes of bonus tracks, which include Ornette blowing changes and playing bebop, would make a damn fine EP. Instead, they sit there at the very beginning, saying, ""We are the loam from which Song X will arise forthwith.""
"
FALSE,A,Arular,M.I.A.,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12741,"
The deepest cut on Arular is ""Amazon,"" where M.I.A. the favela funk thief depicts herself as a cultivated Brit kidnapped by Brazilian criminals. She's missing from Acton, her London 'hood, but after she fell for that palm tree smell, ""bodies started merging."" The vertiginous excitement of pan-ethnic identity, so unlike the purity the Tamil Tigers kill for, imbues every pieced-together track, but only on ""Hombre,"" a pidgin-Spanish proposition with a sitar intro, does it get quite so explicit. Violence is everywhere, dropped casually like a funk grenade or flaunted instructively as in the oft quoted ""It's a bomb yo/So run yo/Put away your stupid gun yo."" But not for a moment does the violence seem vindictive, sadistic, or pleasurable. It's a fact of life to be triumphed over, with beats and tunelets stolen or remembered or willed into existence. This is the territory I've always wished Missy Elliott would risk, and let's not be coy about how M.I.A. got there. ""Banana Skit"" starts the album with her only message: ""Get yourself an education.""

FALSE,A,Maya (Deluxe Edition),M.I.A.,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15222,"
Since self-made celebrities with pretensions always stumble eventually, I figure it's my place in the food chain not to act like a hyena when they do. So I kept listening, and concluded that while this is no Kala, what is? Arular is the analogy, only there she strove to ingratiate and here she elects not to--with immensely more success than MGMT on Congratulations and rather more success than Kanye West on 808s and Heartbreak. The stark beats take some getting used to, and there are lyrical miscues that still make me wince when they catch my ear--only it's been a while, because I'm too busy loving those beats and the spunky, shape-shifting, stubbornly political, nouveau riche bundle of nerves who holds them together. I admit that I'm now less inclined to hear ""Teqkilla"" as a lust song for her just plain rich honey and more as a red flag about her alcohol consumption. But if you've ever been a fan, this isn't where to stop. Just play it a few more times than the fools who clocked dollars for the job and you'll get your money's worth. And I do mean on all 16 new songs--three of the four bonus tracks are upper 50th percentile for sure.

FALSE,A,AIM,M.I.A.,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16879,"
Nothing has made me happier in this horrendous moment than Maya Arulpragasam's loopy, simplistic fifth album. Fuck you if you think it's ""lightweight"" or ""confusing"" or ""aimless"" or ""ho-hum""--it's the hard-earned proof of the happiness she's achieved after years of fretting about the asinine shaming of 2010's excellent Maya for the crime of following Kala, which was only the greatest album of the century. As no one notices, her sonorities, scales, and tune banks have never been more Asian--mostly East Asian, especially up top, although I'm partial to the uncredited oud-I-think on ""Ali r u ok."" That's one more signal of the self-acceptance enjoyed by this refugee on an album she says is about refugees, as is her damn right as someone who migrated/fled from London to Sri Lanka to India back to Sri Lanka back to London to--after absurd bureaucratic hoohah--the USA. Never a convincing intellectual, she makes a point of keeping these lyrics beyond basic--declaring ""we"" a trope, jumping on the byword ""jump,"" riffing on every stupid bird rhyme she can think of. The recommended non-""deluxe"" 12-track version ends with one called ""Survivor,"" which like it or not she is. ""Men are good, men are bad/And the war is never over,"" she notes. ""Survivor, survivor/Who said it was easy?/Survivor, survivor/They can never stop we."" Takeaway: bad shit being her heritage, she intends to enjoy herself however bad the shit gets, and so should we.

Not only are those not her breasts, at least not the ones her biologicals gave her, but her hair isn't really pink or, wink wink, straight. Not only is the quick-lipped hoyden of the year all ""Young Money, Cash Money, yeah I'm Universal"" with every upper-case except the ""I"" discretionary, but she's consorting with Natasha Bedingfield and reminding will.i.am how he did it. Half rapping and half singing, half bragging and half kowtowing, brazening a ""punt"" rhyme here and proclaiming commonality with ""girls that never thought they could win"" there, she's proud to be shameless, with the hooks to back it up. She knows well the presumably stolen words of her male collaborator-counterpart Drake: ""Everybody dies but not everybody lives."" And damn right she calls this living.

FALSE,A,3-Way Tie (for Last),Minutemen,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5481,"
Since their uncompromising reach always exceeded their fairly amazing grasp, I tried to cut myself a little critical distance in the wake of a rock death that for wasted potential has Lennon and Hendrix for company. Sure they never sounded better, I said, but they're still a little naive here and conceptual there. Only that wasn't distance--it was denial. D. Boon's singing, writing, and playing here are all infused with a new lyrical lift that adds unexpected buoyancy to a band that was generous at its most cynical and confused, and as a result their zigzag rhythms and interesting conceptualisms get the songful relief they need. After seven fairly amazing years he was just getting started. Shit, shit, shit.
"
FALSE,A,I Phantom,Mr. Lif,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11807,"
I've long suspected that a musically pleasurable album would betray everything the misanthropes at Def Jux stood for--their principles, their vision, their neuroses. But all it took was a normal rapper, which Mr. Lif is--for a rapper, abnormally so. However autobiographical this song cycle, which begins with a stickup and ends with a nuclear holocaust, it evinces not only conceptual ambition but detailed knowledge of what it's like to work a job and raise a family. It's underpinned by an analysis more Boots Riley than Talib Kweli or Steve Earle. And it fleshes out its cohesive narrative and cogent ideas with beats that respect the spare antipop ethos without abjuring such wayward rhythm elements as femme chorus, bass-drum-whoop jam, and $20 synth loop.
"
FALSE,A,Blue,Joni Mitchell,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1840,"
As Joni grooves with the easy-swinging elite-rock sound of California's pop aristocrats, her relation to their (and her own) easy-swinging sexual ethic becomes more probing. But thoughtfulness isn't exactly making her sisterly--I've even heard one woman complain that she can't sing Joni's melodies any more. Well, too bad--they're getting stronger all the time, just like the lyrics. From the eternal ebullience of ""All I Want"" to the month-after melancholy of ""Blue,"" this battlefront report on the fitful joys of buy-now pay-later love offers an exciting, scary glimpse of a woman in a man's world.
"
FALSE,A,For the Roses,Joni Mitchell,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1841,"
Sometimes her complaints about the men who have failed her sound petulant, but the appearance of petulance is one of the prices of liberation. If this has none of the ingratiating ease of Blue, that's because Mitchell has smartened up--she's more wary, more cynical. Perhaps as a result, the music, which takes on classical colors from Tom Scott's woodwinds and Bobby Notkoff's chamber strings, is more calculated. Where the pretty swoops of her voice used to sound like a semiconscious parody of the demands placed on all female voices and all females, these sinuous, complex melodies have been composed to her vocal contours with palpable forethought. They reward stubborn attention with almost hypnotic appeal.
"
FALSE,A,Court and Spark,Joni Mitchell,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1842,"
The first album she's ever made that doesn't sound like a musical departure--it's almost standard rock, For the Roses gone mainstream. But the relative smoothness is a respite rather than a copout, the cover version of ""Twisted"" suggests a brave future, and she's the best singer-songwriter there is right now. Even the decrease in verbal daring--the lyrics are quite personal and literal--makes for a winning directness in songs like ""Help Me"" and ""Raised on Robbery."" Now all I want to know is whether ""Free Man in Paris"" is about David Geffen.

FALSE,A,The Modern Lovers,The Modern Lovers,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1835,"
These legendary sessions, produced by John Cale for Warners in the early '70s but never released, still sound ahead of their time. Jonathan Richman's gift is to make explicit that love for ""the modern world"" that is the truth of so much of the best rock and roll: by cutting through the vaguely protesty ambience of so-called rock culture he opens the way for a worldliness that is specific, realistic, and genuinely critical. Not that he tries to achieve this himself--he's much too childlike. Sometimes his unmusicianship adds a catch to a three-chord melody and his off-key singing unlocks doors you didn't know were there. But other times he sounds like his allowance is too big, as worldly as Holden Caulfield with no '50s for excuse--the first rock hero who could use a spanking.

FALSE,A,Solid Ether,Nils Petter Molvaer,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4848,"
The son of a (savor this phrase) local jazz musician from an island off the northwest coast of Norway, Molvaer cut his teeth on electric Miles the way other kids cut theirs on Black Sabbath. On 1998's Khmer, he joined or anticipated Jon Hassell, Tim Hagans, and Graham Haynes (with Bill Laswell the only nontrumpeter) in the growing cadre of syncretic visionaries who set themselves to building something from that idea a quarter century after it was hauled off the jazzsite in black plastic bags. And on this follow-up, he sounds like the best of them. Not alone in connecting Agartha to the turmoil of drum and bass, he has the guts to let the beat take over, and when he goes ambient he looks to Gil Evans for structural reinforcement. He references Don Cherry as well as Jack Johnson. He mixes in dub, vocoder, a borrowed piccolo trumpet, even two discreet poetry readings. He immerses in chaos and comes out beautiful.

FALSE,A,Monk,Thelonious Monk,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12215,"
I love Columbia's recent Monk reissues: my beloved twice-purchased Criss Cross, Solo Monk with its organic bonus tracks, It's Monk's Time set up by the staggering stride of ""Lulu's Back in Town."" I also dig the much-praised Underground, for its full sound and wealth of originals--though I prefer ""Boo Boo's Birthday"" to ""Ugly Beauty"" and ""Green Chimneys,"" am glad Teo Macero axed those bass solos, and consider Jon Hendricks's ratchety vocal and witless lyric to ""In Walked Bud"" a sacrilege. But this is my favorite, because he and his men rehab standards so crookedly (Gershwin, Berlin, p.d. playground chant), and because boon straight man Charlie Rouse is all over it--not least on Monk's ""Pannonica,"" originally the property of Sonny Rollins himself.
"
FALSE,A,The Very Best,Thelonious Monk,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13159,"
Everything El Supremo did for Blue Note is worth owning and these foundational recordings of his best-known tunes--13 in all, running just under 40 minutes--aren't always as forcefully shaped or incandescently accompanied as in their more practiced Prestige, Riverside, and Columbia incarnations. I miss ""Skippy,"" Sonny Rollins, and Charlie Rouse; hell, I miss Ernie Henry. Nevertheless, there is no simpler or cheaper way to access Monk's compositional genius in its naked glory, and here more than anywhere his playing gives the Sinatra-like sense that he both knows exactly what he wants to do and is always shifting slightly at the last millisecond. A powerful thinker with a wicked sense of humor, he can't resist seeking perfection--or is it playin' with ya?

FALSE,A,Thelonious Monk Quartet With John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall,Thelonious Monk Quartet,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13116,"
Funny ha ha and funny peculiar, Monk's startling block chords, disdain for the romantic arpeggio, and flat-out genius have long rendered him rock's favorite jazz pianist, and the spiritual ambition of Coltrane's endless sheets of sound left a deeper impression on hippiedom and its musical aftermaths than any other jazz. Both musicians were at some kind of peak the night of this miraculously unearthed 1957 performance, and though Coltrane was playing Monk, not Coltrane, his longing to bust out just adds dynamic tension. It's humbling to realize that if someone with a decent tape machine had captured another 50 minutes of this band's music . . . well, it would have been looser, the multi-artist concert format of this gig does provide formal discipline. But discard the bass and drum solos and it could have been almost as remarkable, ad infinitum to a never-to-be-determined point of satiety.

FALSE,A,Thelonious Monk/Sonny Rollins,Thelonious Monk/Sonny Rollins,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15841,"
Rollins lays out on two trio numbers and tackles only one Monk tune on this five-track, 34-minute 1954 product. But that performance belongs on both guys' life list: the little-recorded closer ""Friday the 13th,"" an indelible four-note motif Monk made up in the studio that's stated breathily by Rollins and then tossed around for 10 minutes by the principals, MJQ bassist Percy Heath, left-field drummer Willie Jones, and--adding unexpected and melodic textural chutzpah--Julius Watkins on French horn. Supported by original bebopper Tommy Potter and hard-bop stalwart Art Taylor, the Fields-Kern and Caesar-Youmans standards that open ain't Swiss cheese either.

No doowoppers worth a damn--not even the micromanaged Drifters--were slicker or more precise than Harvey Fuqua's underlings. They couldn't have done it without Bobby Lester, who adapted his flexible light baritone as easily to straight ballad readings as to the tricky swoops and sobs bassman-bossman Fuqua demanded. But Lester flopped on his own, while Fuqua went on to a&amp;r Etta James, Junior Walker, the Spinners, and ""Sexual Healing""-era Marvin Gaye, a New Moonglow 25 years before. Subsuming window displays of special effects in songful flow, the pleasure Fuqua's arrangements take in vocal interaction is clever, calculated, corny--all that. But they're also richer and more ecumenical than almost anything in the gospel quartet tradition doowop supposedly cheapens.

FALSE,A,The Very Best,Lee Morgan,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13160,"
Morgan's 1963 ""The Sidewinder"" was a perfect piece of jazz funk and very nearly his ruination. He kept trying to repeat it and couldn't, because an inspired pop-jazz instrumental is a far rarer thing than, for instance, an inspired bebop solo. Meanwhile, the bebop faithful, who were too refined for ""The Sidewinder"" anyway, accused him of following formula, beating his grandmother, and so forth. Capitol should assemble a collection of attempted repetitions--""Cornbread"" and ""Sneaky Pete"" are my nominations--but this isn't it. Instead it balances a compromise on the fulcrum of the catchy-yet-complex ""Ceora."" Joe Henderson and Wayne Shorter understood both sides like few other saxophonists, and Morgan's bright, robust trumpet deserves to remembered by ""I Remember Clifford."" Funky enough.

FALSE,A,His Band and Street Choir,Van Morrison,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4089,"
Morrison is still a brooder--""Why did you leave America?"" he asks over and over on the final cut, and though I'm not exactly sure what he's talking about, that sounds like a good all-purpose question/accusation to me--but not an obsessive one, and this is another half-step away from the acoustic late-night misery of Astral Weeks. As befits hits, ""Domino"" and especially ""Blue Money"" are more celebratory if no more joyous than anything on Moondance, showing off his loose, allusive white r&amp;b at its most immediate. And while half of side two is comparatively humdrum, I play it anyway.
"
FALSE,A,It's Too Late to Stop Now,Van Morrison,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4094,"
Songs that wore poorly or were just lame in the first place have more force and rightness on this exemplary live album than in their studio versions, and ""Here Comes the Night"" sounds fresher than it did in 1965. In addition, Morrison documents his debt to blues and r&amp;b definitively--you can hear Bobby Bland all over the record, and cover tributes are paid as well to Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, Sonny Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters, and Sam Cooke.
"
FALSE,A,Into the Music,Van Morrison,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4099,"
The rockers are a little lightweight, the final cut drags halfway through, and that's all that's wrong with this record, including its tributes to ""the Lord."" You might get religion yourself if all of your old powers returned after years of failed experiments, half-assed compromises, and onstage crack-ups. Like that other godfearing singer-songwriter, Morrison has abandoned metaphorical pretensions, but only because he loves the world. His straightforward celebrations of town and country are colored and deepened by his musicians--especially sprightly violinist Toni Marcus (feh on Scarlet Rivera)--and by his own excursions into a vocalise that has never been more various or apt. The only great song on this record is ""It's All in the Game,"" written by Calvin Coolidge's future vice-president in 1912. But I suspect it's Van's best album since Moondance.

You'd think he'd never plumbed the depths of Scientology and Madame George--he deserves his own coffee-table compilation, with alternate takes and bootlegged live covers boxed and indexed for your scholarly delectation. And rest assured you'll get one, to commemorate his inevitable election to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. But despite its upbeat market savvy, I'll bet on this spiritually enlightened hour and a quarter. For all its chronological leaps, it moves as one thing--the seven '80s cuts honor Moondance and Into the Music, including ""Wonderful Remark,"" previously available only on a damn soundtrack. Lighten up. Listen up.

You know how Will Smith makes the corny hip-hop albums you'd expect of a leading man with a sense of humor? Well, this is the arty hip-hop album you'd expect of a character actor who steals every marginal flick he's in--only unlike Smith's, Mos Def's is good. Half associative rhymes that clock in under two-and-a-half minutes, devoid of hooks but full of sounds you want to hear again, it's like a dream mixtape--one unresolved track morphing into the next to define a world hip-hop with poles in Brooklyn and Beirut. Almost every thoughtfully slurred word is comprehensible, including most of the ones he sings in Spanish, and the vision justifies the Malcolm X intro. In ""The Embassy,"" Mos Def describes a luxury hotel as an outsider, too aware to come on like one of those thug fools who think they own a joint that'll blacklist them five years from now. And in the Bed-Stuy lookback ""Life in Marvelous Times"" he offers a credo: ""More of less than ever before/It's just too much more for your mind to absorb/It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt/We can't be alive in no time but now.""

With his precise, delicate, discretely dubwise production--sly horn part there, elegantly understated percussion effect here, bass and drums measured into the groove--and quiet, even timid vocal manner, this poet-turned-rootsman sounds like the most live-and-let-live of ital mystics. In fact he's not only urban but interested in subways and Bellevue, not only militant but smart about it--which is to say among other things that he doesn't seem to think his natural is the only natural.

I could cavil about omissions, ""Death May Be Your Santa Claus"" especially. But 20 years after the fact, you remember great bands for their sound as much as their songs, and these guys had one. They were prepunk, everybody knows that, but too often the ""pre"" is given short shrift. So remember this: committed to sarcasm, dystopia, and noise, they never took refuge in punk's inspired-amateur minimalism. On the contrary, their expansive mess was pure '60s, as was their penchant for the elegiac and the lyrical. It's a synthesis 10,000 garage bands have fucked up since. The 10,001st was Nirvana.

FALSE,A,Tallahassee,The Mountain Goats,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11730,"
John Darnielle's embattled ""alpha couple"" are no more a single fictional creation than his Mountain Goats are a group or his ""I"" is himself. They're the kind of irreducible sociological construct that impresses artists that settle into deep heartland--literally Iowa for Darnielle, symbolically where it says on 2002's much flatter DIY All Hail West Texas and now the different place it says on this well-enhanced major-indie debut (which comes trailing Ghana, Sweden, and Full Force Galesburg). Darnielle gets mileage out of songs-with-strummed-guitar's confessional imperative; as unautobiographical as we guess his Tallahassee-and/or-Texas interpersonals must be, there's tremendous emotional oomph in his first person. His singing reinforces the effect. And if there's nothing heartland about ""Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania/Trucks loaded down with weapons/Crossing over every night/Moon yellow and bright,"" well, really, who cares?

Inexhaustible wordslinger, belated bandleader, John Darnielle submits a singer's record. He enunciates so forcefully that any verbal incoherence is your fault, projects so loudly it takes months to notice his backup musicians. This is a record whose idea of poetry is ""That's good we can always use more electrical equipment,"" ""I eat a couple of Milky Ways for breakfast,"" and ""Get in the goddamn car."" Nothing begins-middles-and-ends like ""No Children"" or ""International Small Arms Traffic Blues"" because speed freaks tweaking from one meaningless activity to the next don't generate much narrative logic. Every character is a loser or fuckup whose future is no bleaker than that of the planet we all inhabit. They aren't redeemed by Darnielle's love because he doesn't love a one of them. But they are redeemed by his interest, in them and in the planet we all inhabit. And whenever he flags a little, they're also redeemed by his backup musicians.

Thorny to begin with, John Darnielle reached some near-perfect threshold of liminal comprehensibility with Tallahassee 10 years ago, then got thornier again, albeit in liminally comprehensible mode. But here he goes so clear Tom Cruise may propose matrimony. If you want songs that hit as hard as ""No Children"" and ""International Small Arms Traffic Blues,"" put on your body armor, because most of these hit harder. From ""Amy AKA Spent Gladiator""'s unequivocal ""stay alive"" to the title youth rising heavenward on ""air gone black with flies,"" here is all-embracing existential despair that refuses to get down in the mouth about it, peaking with two sunken-hopes tracks midway through that taken as a diptych constitute the greatest song he's ever written. Matthew E. White's horn charts are the musical development Darnielle has in store for us. But the dealmaker is Jon Wurster's spare, inescapable drumming.

FALSE,A,A Crow Looked at Me,Mount Eerie,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17230,"
It's essential and not all that difficult to distinguish the persona who sings the song from the person who created both the song and the persona. And then there's this, which begins with a very biographical version of gently depressive Puget Sounder Phil Elverum shakily observing: ""Death is real / Someone's there and then they're not / and it's not for singing about / It's not for making into art."" The someone is Elverum's wife of 13 years, ghosted away from her sickroom by cancer exactly a week before the song was recorded. It's so spare and bleak that it took me a lot longer than a week to notice that Elverum had laid a forthrightly bassy thrum underneath his finger-brushed acoustic guitar, arting death up after all. But what choice did he have if he hoped to expiate the grief that consumed him? And given that, what can it mean when he ends the same song: ""I don't want to learn anything from this. I love you."" Such autobiographical conundrums are one of this album's achievements whether Elverum is in control of them or not. But they're obliterated by the immediacy and detail of his loss, of his living yet inexorably transmuting love for his dead wife, of their living baby daughter, of the modest domestic arrangements he can hardly bear to recall. Brutal to listen to for all its quiet. Like nothing I've ever heard.

A pop connoisseur even as a kid in a jug band, Muldaur always brings savoir-faire to ""folk"" materials. But she's never sung with so much attention, delicacy and lyrical intelligence. She extracts meaning from songs a younger Dylan played as look-ma-June-spoon throwaways, lifts the title tune from well-earned obscurity, lays ""Lay Lady Lay"" across her big brass soul and rescues ""Make You Feel My Love"" from Billy Joel. And also from Bob Dylan. Even when the songwriter does this kind of material straight, he's not sexy--not like Rod Stewart or Al Green. But Muldaur, who's been known to slather the libido on too thick, is serious about getting into bed with him.

Now 75, Muldaur became a dynamo in her fifties, an album a year between 1998 and 2011. Always a nuanced singer, she got subtler, sassier, and smarter; her pipes remained supple and the burr in her voice never went to seed. But her best albums were sharpened by a concept, particularly the wide-ranging Memphis Minnie tribute Richland Woman Blues and the mind-blowing .Heart of Mine: The Love Songs of Bob Dylan and its climactic ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere,"" which gets busier in that easy chair than was dreamt of in the Byrds' philosophy. This album flips the script by breaking out an obscure songbook rather than reimagining a famous one. Muldaur has been performing Blue Lu and Danny Barker's lubricious title song since it spiced up her solo debut in 1973, and in 2007 she assembled a whole album called Naughty, Bawdy &amp; Blue. Here she lightens her timbre in tribute to her friend Lu on top of a hyperactive New Orleans band, and she's never sounded sexier or more committed. ""Georgia Grind"" jumps out at ""Mama mama look at sis,"" after which ""Loan Me Your Husband"" follows hard upon ""Leave My Man Alone."" But it signifies that naughty and bawdy ain't all. ""Now You're Down in the Alley"" and ""Here's a Little Girl from Jacksonville"" could double as 50s dance novelties, ""Nix on Those Lush Heads"" means what it says, and if ""Trombone Man Blues"" evokes Dinah Washington at her filthiest, ""A Little Bird"" ends happily ever after. After all, Blue Lu and Danny were wed for 67 years.

Missing any metallic mbalax edge as Jean-Philippe Rykiel squished around in the background, I mistook this for a variation on the fusion compromises of N'Dour's Columbia years.

Unlike the two previous Nonesuch albums by Africa's premier pop star--the 2002 ecumenical, the 2005 Muslim--this isn't designed to inspire conversion experiences. But believe that its melodicism and vocal dexterity exceed those of whatever contemporary standard-bearer you favor in those realms, that the clarity and range of the singing epitomize what is usually meant by beauty, and that at 48 this Sufihas got him some beats. Having long realized that crossover was most gracefully accomplished by conceptual clarity, he keeps things organized this time out by tending to business at home. On half the tracks a banjo-like ngoni, which this being Senegal N'dour designates a xalam, gestures toward the Malian desert directly to his north, imparting a capering intricacy and folkish flavor to what remains Dakar dance music. To most Americans, however, it will probably just sound like Africa, and pretty darn good.

Alerted to this May EP in August when a friend in Prague sent me a YouTube link, I playlisted it on Spotify briefly before it vanished, learned that it can be purchased from Apple in Europe but not here, declined free downloads from websites poised to pass my passwords to Carter Page, and finally snagged something I could burn when a magician I know Dropboxed me. The label is a mystery, the title sometimes spelled ""Senegal"" and/or ""Rek,"" and though I've read that an ""international"" iteration called Africa Rekk is expected late November, who knows what exactly it'll be. So try YouTube and be vigilant. As someone who's adored him for all of this century, what I hear in these songs I don't understand a word of is more specifically Senegalese than his Nonesuch catalogue and more tightly conceived than 2012's live Mballax Dafay Wax--a tensile spirituality sorely missed from American music in a year whose horrific downside is regularly sidestepped or ignored. The arrangements enact a tempered, unrelenting responsiveness in which lives lived under lifelong pressure aspire to a transcendence that's actively treasured. A voice that has begun to weather rises to moments of startling sweetness and lyricism. The Senegal-raised Akon has a strong cameo that's the dullest thing on the record.

It wasn't a penchant for rock mythos and hairstyle that crossed him over--it was pure-pop generalizations and jazz timing. ""Am I Blue,"" a 1929 copyright for Hollywood lyricist Grant Clarke, sounds no more and no less a natural-born chestnut than ""Crazy"" or ""Funny How Time Slips Away""; conversational strokes like ""One in a Row"" and ""Opportunity to Cry"" clue you in with their titles and proceed to amaze you anyway. ""Me and Paul""'s understated outlaw narrative points to Red Headed Stranger, but it represents a break.

In the Nashville era, country instrumental albums have been models of dexterous precision and dispatch dominated by the sterile expanses of the Chet Atkins catalogue, a tradition that shares as much with this gift from God as Nelson's singing does with Brooks &amp; Dunn's. Even simpatico analogies--early string bands, the looser Western swing units, the relaxation Merle Haggard's guys go for, or for that matter Django Reinhardt--don't suggest the casual musicality this long-running off-and-on octet achieves without apparent effort every time it sits down, which happens 150 nights a year. Musicians for life who've achieved a satori that barely skirts virtuosity, they adore the melody. But they adore it after their own fashion, which is Willie's fashion whether he's singing or, as here, only playing lead guitar--pretty much on the note when you listen up, only you don't because the timbre and phrasing are so talky. Is this a species of jazz? Given the awkwardness of the session Nelson once cut with jazz-identified Nashvillian Jackie King, I wouldn't bother calling it that. It's just Willie, who wants folks to think everything he does is simpler than it is and in some mystical sense may be right.

As Nelson made room for his 85th birthday, he also beefed up his wee catalogue by adding 11 new tunes written with whippersnapping seventysomething Buddy Cannon. Their organizing concept is wisdom as opposed to age brags proper like ""I don't want to be the last man standing / But wait a minute maybe I do."" Sometimes the wisdom is rakish: ""I gave you a ring then you gave me the finger,"" ""He might not know me 'cause I'm low class / But tell him I'm the one with his head up his ass,"" ""Bad breath is better than no breath at all."" Sometimes it's paradoxical: ""We were getting along just fine / Just me and me,"" ""So many people, it sure is lonely."" Sometimes it's just deep: ""It's not something you get over / It's just something you get through."" Always it sounds like it started with an idea that popped out of his mouth or sidled in from his subconscious, and who knows, maybe the weed helped--with an eye on retirement income, he's now marketing his own brand, Willie's Reserve. Over impeccably relaxed session work, that wisdom is delivered with a clarity and resonance that would inspire substance abusers half his age to quit drinking if they had his brains or soul.

Every once in a while Nelson nails a fluke--kiddie album, Hank Snow stopover, sop to his road band. It's the big concepts that fall slightly flat--we're lucky American Classic is as lively as it is. This one falls in between. Three decades ago the late great Jerry Wexler, who signed Nelson to historically R&amp;B Atlantic in 1973 and got Phases and Stages as a reward, came up with the grand scheme of pairing the subliminally jazzy Nelson with the world's greatest Western swing revival band. Only by now Asleep at the Wheel, though in need as always of distinctive vocals and material, has been on the road as long as Bob Wills himself. Enter Wexler's song list and one of the greatest singers alive. Western swing is so rowdy and lighthearted that its chestnuts lack the serious sophistication of great American songbook fare. But they sure are spry, and Nelson is so delighted to be singing them that the band's expertise lights up. Fact is, this compares favorably to Wills' Tiffany Transcriptions box. Fact is, Wills never had a singer in Willie's class either.

After the jaunty ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" I was disappointed to note the tune density diminishing markedly here. Luckily, on my third and I thought final run-through, I noticed Willie emitting the bandless but far from unmusical or amelodic words ""I don't know where I am today/I don't know where I was yesterday/This song has so many notes to play/I just hope that I hit them today."" Thus begins the Senile Dementia Suite, which proceeds through Nelson's 2014 ""Amnesia"" and 1972 ""Who'll Buy My Memories,"" pauses to dig up Al Jolson's ""Anniversary Song,"" and then tops itself off with the inescapably tuneful 2014 ""Laws of Nature"": ""I get my water from the rain/If it don't rain I'll die/Stormy weather saves my life/Sometimes I laugh and wonder why."" There are seven songs after that, mostly remakes of self-written chestnuts he's no doubt remade before. Hell, there's another ""Is the Better Part Over"" on his 2013 album, although you can see how the concept fits better here, as does what is just barely or maybe not a different version of Django Reinhardt's signature ""Nuages,"" which you'll understand when you learn that this is Willie's guitar album way more than it's Bobbie's piano album, which it also is, and yes, the rest of his band pitches in subtly when needed. My mother-in-law played Willie's Stardust on repeat in her last years. I won't be like that--I have more music in my kit. But as a senescence album this definitely tops L. Cohen's.

If you're tempted by Willie and Double K's Songwriter soundtrack, go on to the next graf. Best thing about his mucho pusho duet compilation with Hank Williams, Julio Iglesias, Lacy J. Dalton, and so forth is its title: Half Nelson. Highwaymen, featuring Johnny Cash on every track plus Waylon and Double K on many, is Outlaws III (or V, who's counting?), with Cash's ""Committed to Parkview"" providing a therapeutic shot of contemporary realism. Angel Eyes, backed by the Nashville-gone-jazzer guitar of Jackie King, is Nashville-gone-jazzy. The Faron Young collaboration Funny How Time Slips Away is almost on a level with Willie's Ray Price album, but Young's timbre has thickened so moistly you'd swear the Hank Williams he's now imitating is Jr. And so. I've always been put off by Snow's up-north propriety, more Vernon Dalhart than Jimmie Rodgers, but after 70 years his baritone is finally beginning to crack, providing Willie just the opening he needs to loosen the old pro up: without sacrificing a diphthong of his famous enunciation, Snow sounds completely relaxed. The tossed-off serendipity of so many Nelson records translates here into a casually engaging, deftly eclectic bunch of classics and obscurities, Willie's best album since he and Webb Pierce cut In the Jailhouse Now on a long coffee break in 1982.

Daniel Lanois's production is so subtle that at first this seems like a return to mighty-kootie-fiyo, but in fact it's the modernization they've been chasing since the Meters were history. Whether isolating rhythm-makers, adding electronic atmosphere, or recontextualizing ""natural""-seeming instrumental effects (the un-New Orleans bottleneck that grounds ""The Ballad of Hollis Brown,"" the Dirty Dozen horns that rescue ""Wild Injuns"" from generic throwaway), Lanois isn't afraid to go for drama, and while drama does have a way of palling eventually, the songs are worth the risk. The expansive ""My Blood"" and the educational ""Sister Rosa"" are their finest millennial-political originals ever, and though ""Hollis Brown,"" ""With God on Our Side,"" ""A Change Is Gonna Come,"" and ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" may seem like an obvious bunch of covers, their total effect is audacious instead (one '64 Dylan OK, but two?). Add Art's singing lessons (from Aaron) and Charles's horn lessons (from Lee Allen, say) and you have their masterpiece. Even the languours of ""Healing Chant"" seem apt and premeditated.

Despite my immense misgivings--Newman's political sensitivity, a useful attribute in one conceptualizing about the South, has never impressed me--I'm convinced that this is Newman's second-best album. It also rights a career that was threatening to wind down into cheap sarcasm. Contrary to published report, the white Southerners Newman sings about/from are never objects of contempt. Even Newman's psychotic and exhibitionist and moron show dignity and imagination, and the rednecks of the album's most notorious songs are imbued by the smart-ass Los Angeles Jew who created them with ironic distance, a smart-ass's kindest cut of all. There is, natcherly, a darker irony: no matter how smart they are about how dumb they are, they still can't think of anything better to do than keep the niggers down.

""What did you discover about musical theater?"" wondered a Hollywood reporter more impressed by Newman's Broadway aspirations than by his Faustian ambition. ""There's no money in it,"" replied the artiste, who holds down a day job in the family business, which is scoring movies. And though Newman's pact with musical theatre requires him to sacrifice music, where his gifts are huge, for theatre, where he's a novice, the songs themselves are rich, mocking rock, religion, musical comedy, the classix, and American culture all at once. Newman's Devil is a midlife whiner, James Taylor's God a palavering politician, Don Henley's Faust a bigger creep than both of them put together, Bonnie Raitt and Linda Ronstadt's good girl-bad girl a set piece. Yet these brontosauri dance through their dress rehearsal with the found grace of busmen on holiday, and the pleasure Newman takes in his hubris is so ebullient that the satire never turns cheap. If the project reeks of concept album, well, pardon me for reading--the songs do get even better once you take in the plot summary. And if it reeks of burlesque, well, how better to bum-rush Western civ and ""America's greatest art form"" simultaneously?

After an annuity's worth of soundtracks, a box stuffed with marginalia, and Faust, his first true album since 1988 finds him more cynical than ever, about himself above all. Having called one cheap joke ""I'm Dead (But I Don't Know It),"" he explains the belated tribute to the wife and family he kissed off in the '70s with a simple ""I'd sell my soul and your souls for a song,"" then announces: ""But I wanted to write you one/Before I quit/And this one's it."" Thing is, cheap jokes and cynicism have always been his gift to the world, and when he's on he can twist the knife. In joke mode, check out not only ""I'm Dead,"" so anti-Randy it'll have young yahoos saying amen like they just discovered Mahalia Jackson, but two of his cruelest political songs ever: one a history of early imperialism where the punch line is HIV, another addressed with dulcet malice to Mr. Karl Marx. For cynicism, try ""My Country,"" which might just be about his family too, and ""Shame,"" where Newman plays a hateful old hard-on indistinguishable from himself. Twisting his croak a turn further are the most articulate arrangements of his singer-songwriting life: jazzlike, but in a piano-based rock context that shifts at a moment's notice to any voicing (Hollywood-symphonic, country march, pop-schlock) that might reshade a meaning or make the ear believe what the mind can't stand. There are a few ringers. But the last time he was so strong in this mode he was married to the wife he misses.

Post-hippie, Newman's cynicism was tonic. Post-post-hippie, it curdled. Now, freshened by frailty and outrage, it's restorative again. Describing a near-death experience in the title song, he injects a kindness he's rarely risked into absurdist jokes that are as mean as ever, and that moment of compassion adds depth to the three political songs in the middle, two of which target a privileged class that explicitly includes the artiste. The other rearranges 2007's caustic YouTube special ""A Few Words in Defense of Our Country"": ""The end of an empire/Messy at best/This empire's ending/Like all the rest."" Did he write those lines in five minutes, fussing for a little longer over ""messy,"" or wait years for them to come? Lyrically, every one of these 10 songs in 34 minutes raises that question, reinforced by the quietest and most casual singing of Newman's mush-mouthed career. Musically, however, he's a fine jeweler, a busy beaver and an old pro. Never have his arrangements exploited his soundtrack chops so subtly, changeably or precisely. You say you want the failure of the American Dream? Try a marching band put through its paces by a dyspeptic Kurt Weill. King Leopold of Belgium? How about a little ""Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah""? Arrhythmia? Easy.

FALSE,A,Dark Matter,Randy Newman,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17105,"
It begins with an eight-minute playlet enacting a Godsplaining rally in the Research Triangle. It follows with five minutes of ""Brothers"" JFK and RFK launching the Bay of Pigs to save Celia Cruz. Then comes the four-minute ""Putin"" Newman put on YouTube last October. All informed and funny and painful and complex, all intricately and wittily orchestrated. But well past a dozen engaging passes I still can't guarantee how replayable they'll eventually prove, which I wouldn't say of five of the remaining six tracks, in particular two heart songs: the multivocal, jam-packed, basic-sounding 3:55-minute tour de force ""Lost Without You,"" in which a frightened old man eavesdrops on a conversation between his kids and his dying wife, and the made-for-TV ""She Chose Me,"" which my wife and I certified as a great pop song by feeling it personally and individually even though it's autobiographical for neither of us. Too bad ""It's a Jungle Out There,"" the expanded theme song of Tony Shalhoub's OCD TV sleuth Monk, seems merely sarcastic. But the only way there'll be a better album in 2017 is if some genius comes up with one that unifies the Democratic Party in song from the left, only not . . . never mind, this is a record review.

I never knew why their definitive electrodisco impressed me more than it moved me, and now I don't know why it has me rocking out of my chair or grinning foolishly as I forage for dinner at the supermarket. The tempos are a touch less stately, the hooks a touch less subliminal. Bernard Albrecht's vocals have taken on so much affect they're humane. And the joke closer softens up a skeptic like me to the pure, physically exalting sensation of the music.

Twelve cuts, eleven previously released some way or other, five available some way or other on U.S. albums, only one in this form. The emphasis is on twelve-inch mixes, with a new vocal patched into the hallowed ""Temptation."" The double-CD includes a whole extra disc of collectorama, but the double vinyl has no fat: it does nothing less than show off the greatest disco band of the '80s except Chic, and these guys outlasted Chic. Of course, not until Chic was gone did their disco dwell fully among us. The secret of Bernard Albrecht's elementary vocals, Gillian Gilbert's two-finger exercises, Peter Hook's strummed bass, and the compressed physicality of Steve Morris's drums was never virtuosity--it was conception, timing, rapport, devotional concentration. Originally attracted to disco because it was trancelike, they broke through when they devised a system of kinetic percussion and hypnotic chants to keep themselves awake. Cultists miss the murk of the early mixes, but I prefer them hyped and speeded up. Pure rhythm machine with an ironically mysterious overlay of schlocky melody to help it go down, this album is a case study in sensationalist art, and I say the world is better for it.

Marvel all you want over Ian Curtis's desperation--I dig the band on the matched Joy Division comp Permanent and prefer detached techie Bernard Albrecht here. Where 1987's Substance showcased the music's remixed, interwoven glory, this pushes Albrecht's mild-mannered vocals as far front as they'll go. Turns out he has normal feelings about love and rejection and such, dislikes war and guns without getting preachy--just super-unassumingly super-catchy, as befits Britannia's ranking pop group. I mean, could Blur or Oasis write a World Cup anthem so rousing, danceable, and informative?

Carl Newman's ad hoc outfit could be the greatest band in the world if he didn't write so obsessively about purveying their tune-porn, but he'll settle for the status he's got. Claiming Krautrock and shrugging off the departed Dan Bejar, he generates 11 soaring new pop songs, which in some abstrusely Krautrock way are sparer than the 13 on Brill Bruisers. And from those songs let me corral a few snatches of meaning. ""I only play for the money honey."" ""You can imagine all the factions/That form around high ticket attractions."" ""A scalper's price built into the design."" ""Colosseums of the mind / An ancient con, the shadows of a song."" ""This is the world of the theater / Come up with some highbrow move / Think of all the lives we're saving / Think of all the ways we'll cave in."" ""With the ignorance of a poet."" ""Second-rate Socrates"" (second, eh?). ""Cottage industry."" ""I wasn't hoping for a win / I was hoping for freedom / You couldn't beat 'em / Forget the mission just get out alive.""

In which the whimsy and vocal pyrotechnics of Aerial Ballet and Pandemonium Shadow Show (now cunningly collapsed into a disc called Aerial Pandemonium Ballet) are apotheosized under the direction of popmeister Richard Perry. The bathrobed recluse who shows his unshaven face on the cover (his well-stocked fridge is on the back) veers from kitsch fantasy both romantic (""Without You"") and comic (""Coconut"") to terrified evocations of everyday existence (the cockeyed antemeridian triptych--""Gotta Get Up,"" ""Driving Along,"" and ""Early in the Morning""--that kicks off side one). The two-and-a-half years since his last real LP, Harry, have been worth it--if only every artist could learn to mark time until a good one was ready.

Nilsson didn't just share an aesthetic with the Apple-era Beatles who loved him so much--he embodied that aesthetic. Utterly studio-bound, conceiving rock as a facet of pop, proud to be fey yet also proud to pound out the unprecedented lines ""You're breakin' my heart/You're tearin' it apart/So fuck you,"" he was as fluent as songwriting got in the '60s, turning out White Album outtakes like ""Salmon Falls"" and ""All I Think About Is You"" well after his doppelganger Paul had died of whimsy and his soulmate John had discovered his roots. This double-CD is mercifully short on such marginalia; the soundtrack one-offs and previously unreleaseds that make the cut are top-drawer. Except for the three Gordon Jenkins schmaltzfests, the covers are gorgeous. And from the autobiographical ""1941"" to the superschlock ""Without Her"" to such trademark eccentricities-not-novelties as ""Coconut"" and ""Joy"" and ""The Most Beautiful World in the World,"" the high points are ephemeral and transcendent.

Not only did Kurt Cobain transcend alt-rock by rocking so hard, he transcended alt-rock by feeling so deep. On this accidental testament, intended merely to altify the MTV mindset by showcasing the Meat Puppets and covering the Vaselines, Cobain outsensitives Lou Barlow and Eddie Vedder in passing. His secret is sincerity, boring though that may be--he cares less than Barlow without boasting a bit about it, tries harder than Vedder without busting a gut about it. The vocal performance he evokes is John Lennon's on Plastic Ono Band. And he did it in one take.

One new song and 15 old ones--intense renderings of familiar arrangements recycled for the buying season. Maybe it wouldn't carry the same weight if Kurt Cobain were alive. But it wouldn't carry the same weight if everybody had a good job or plague wiped out half the planet, either. Cobain is dead, alienated labor is everywhere, plague is something we worry about, and this is a great record for a world where those three truths are on the table. Less precise and contained than Nevermind or In Utero, it serves an unduplicated function for a band that changed the pop world with four dozen songs. I play Unplugged to refresh my memory of a sojourner's spirituality. I'll play this one when I want to remember a band's guts, fury, and rock and roll music.

FALSE,A,Live at Reading,Nirvana,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14797,"
Nirvana's outtakes retain more jam than most, in part because they've been doled out so sparingly. Even the detritus-happy three-CD/one-DVD With the Lights Out box is not only fascinating but pleasurable. A side effect of this restraint is that, except for the subdued and hence one-of-a-kind MTV Unplugged, this is the band's very first concert album--one show beginning to end rather than the hither-and-yon performances unified into From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah in 1996. Half these 24 songs aren't on that record anyway, but even if most of them were, the sustained mood and energy flow would be something new and precious. The arrangements offer few surprises, though check the guitar intro to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""; the Mudhoney cover and unfinalized ""D-7"" at the end are there to tamp the crowd down a little. So what? This one proceeds directly to the canon.

Having disbanded their punk trio to prove they weren't simply or even primarily punks, Dean Spunt and Randy Randall apply their bag of arty tricks to a punk album with a punk narrative. ""I try to make myself seem vague/Cause the words get so engraved""--OK, understood, only not entirely, which is how they want it. Hence 10 of these songs are directed at a ""you"" that could be a boss, a colleague, an audience, a roommate, or, obviously, a girlfriend, but who is only clearly a female once. There are also three instrumentals, which contextualize the songful riffage of most of the other tracks with the atmospheres in which they've specialized. But the decisive atmosphere is provided by the riffage--hooks and power chords as anthemic as any in punk, only shot through with their atmospheric chops and innovations. In other words, it's a punk album with a difference, which at this late date is the only kind you can count on for a thrill. And what it says beyond its seeming vagueness is: ""we"" care about ""you.""

I got why hip-hop heads were so besotted with her 2016 Telefone. But back then I felt she wasn't quite there yet--""on the brink of a poetic breakthrough"" rather than in flight--and segueing directly from Telefone to Room 25 convinces me I was right. Lovely as Telefone is, Room 25 is standing up and waving as of the hummed piano intro to the 1:35 ""Self,"" and soon ""My pussy teachin ninth-grade English / My pussy wrote a thesis on colonialism"" is rendering ""And y'all still thought a bitch couldn't rap huh?"" a rhetorical question. I can't resist a few quotes: ""Africa's never dead, Africa's always dying,"" ""Globalization's scary and fuckin' is fantastic,"" ""Titties 13K, the pretty costs these days.""  Or mentioning that though Noname is glad you told her Telefone ""saves lives,"" you should also be aware that she ""got no money"" and ""almost passed out drinking."" But delivering all this poetry is the dealmaker: a delicate, even fragile vocal pulse that's also complex and eventful, floating a murmured flow so conversational its rhythmic acuity seems modest, uncalculated. Noname carries the first half of the 35-minute album pretty much alone. But when other vocalists join her--Ravyn Lenae, Phoelix, Smino &amp; Saba--their role is to augment and embellish her sound rather than change it up. Not only is she the boss, she's the source. And I admit it--I like Telefone more now.

The whitegirl hip hop trio's second Web-and-gig EP in under a year was diverted from indie retail by label-deal dreams; three of its eight tracks remake songs that surfaced on the four-track collector's item Hip Hop You've Never Heard, which I prefer for no better reason than that I heard it first. So don't worry--you won't regret this flyer even if it's subsumed by that label deal. Hesta Prynne is angular, self-made, just-don't-give-a-fuck yet caring too; Guinea Love's Long Island grit has earth-mother in it; DJ Sprout projects rounded, earnest, well-bred. The three form an essential unity--call it ""The Trinity,"" since they do. And though their beats beat Stetsasonic's, their commitment to their well-bred side will dog them for as long as they strive. ""Don't blame me 'cause I voted for Gore"" is a great line because it's straight in the sense of candid and a revealing one because it's straight in the sense of normal. I bet Hesta actually did work for the president's wife--licking envelopes, probably. How many rappers can make that claim? And how many rockers?

Except insofar as all voices are different, which counts, the music on this feisty, funny rap album isn't new--just irresistible, like the regional pop crossovers of the pre-Hammer/bling era, the same golden age underground sobersides remember as the heyday of obscure Eric B. soundalikes. DJ Muggs, Pete Rock, ?uestlove, and the High and Mighty all pitch in on a record that calls up memories of Hitman Howie Tee and ends with an LFO rip that shoulda conquered Z100. Hip they're not, I know. Can't be because they're female, or white, or suburban. Right? So figure it's because they're sane--so sane they invoke John Kerry's square name.

Biggie's murder made it too easy to romanticize intimations of mortality that don't truck with any Tupac-style martyr complex. Equally devoid of morbidity and joie de vivre, Biggie is far more sardonic, self-deprecating, and tough-minded, ""ready to die"" in the cast-a-cold-eye sense. Although his moments of warmth for family and comrades seem real enough, he proves one funny son of a bitch on the love-man parody ""#!*@ You Tonight,"" the achingly lyrical slow-falsetto showcase ""Playa Hater"" (""Open the door/Lay on the floor/You've been robbed""), and the tall tale about being caught in some bitch's crib by her Knick boyfriend (""one of those six-five niggas, I don't know""), done first as a rap and then as a story for his boys. Where Cali hides behind funkamysterioso, Puffy Combs's chart-friendly r&amp;b hooks rub comically against Biggie's unoratorical street style, with its trademark Schoolly D cum Butt-head ""huh huh,"" as the likes of RZA, Bone-Thugs, and Lil' Kim add flavor.

Midpart's more meditative, including straight advice directed straight to a stranger straight from the heart. Then the actual breakup tale--""No one was was vindictive, no one lied / Shagged the nanny or the pool boy on the side""--gets us to a celebration of her true love, which is San Francisco.

The title track marches smartly from ""A walking slab of brain damage beneath a bad toupee"" to ""He can't grab my snatch but he can bite my bloody rag"" without deigning to utter the name of the ""orange-tweeting twat"" who rhymes with ""dump/And stump and chump and bump and lump and hump and slump and rump."" That dirty business done, Oberg declines to address him again. Instead she delivers a rhymed disquisition on ""double-blind and peer-reviewed"" empirical method that's over faster than Fats Domino's ""Ain't That a Shame"" while repeating ""We all enjoy results of scientific inquiry"" three times just in case some dumbass missed the point. And then she bids us and history adieu: ""I can see the sunset burning at the end of the world from the end of the continent/The final frame of this ill-fated experiment.""

Once in a while a guitar part backs up a tasty phrase, and when the time comes, someone in Bright Eyes will gracefully provide it.

Isolated culturally and economically by socialist underdevelopment, Tanzanian pop nurtures national treasures more diligently than neighboring Zairean and Kenyan styles--though since soukous is hegemonic from Accra to Harare, you can bet both compete mightily. Ongala's unbrassy lineup--three guitarists, three percussionists, a bassist, and a sax player or two--doesn't strive the way Afro-Parisian often does, which is a relief. Rather than relentless Afrodance upmanship, he cultivates a variety that suits Tanzania's folk-friendly cultural policy.

This 19-cut condensation skips the educational stuff and ought to convert anybody with better taste than Albert Goldman--namely, you. As a student of Western composition, an adept of Japanese vocal technique, and an avant-gardist sworn to throw convention to the wind, Yoko was unready to rock three different ways. Yet on the four early songs the transparent simplicity she strives for sounds truer than the dumb authenticity of Elephant's Memory, and by the '80s she's mastered a studio-rock art-pop whose unremarkable timbres and textures are subtly transformed by her inappropriate training. A transparently simple, transcendently self-conscious triumph of the will--and of the ""Woman Power"" she was corny and prophetic enough to crow about back when she was the weirdo who broke up the Beatles.

The four remakes from Bamba and On Verra ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a are richer and mellower, not just as recordings, where money helped, but performances--Attisso must have missed that guitar "

Leading with three old songs, none in my CD collection and all newly performed, this will take awhile to sink in for anyone who's bonded with Specialist in All Styles. But it will, the five new tunes no less than the six Africa-tested classics, all redone no matter when Baobab started playing them. Much more than the Buena Vista folks, this reconstituted band is the great jewel of world music as a commercial concept. It would never have recorded its finest music if there wasn't an audience of middle-aged white liberals ready to eat it up. Barthelemy Attisso's loping guitar, Issa Cissoko's drolly soulful sax, distinctive voices old and not-so-old adding possible wisdom in four different languages over a shared wealth of Afro-Latin rhythms that include calypso, guajiro, seuraba and what is called mbalsa--all seem like the fruits of rich lives fairly lived. This is precisely the illusion the commercial concept means to propagate. Most likely it's also the truth.

FALSE,A,Heavy on the Highlife!,Oriental Brothers International,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2632,"
The six selections on this 67-minute best-of are attributed to three artists, but I say they're all the Oriental Brothers, so called because they're from eastern Nigeria--the biggest stars of what was once Biafra, where Yoruba juju somehow never caught on. With the polite Ghanaian horn sections that lace through the accompanying Giants of Danceband Highlife as passe as colonialism by the time the war was over, Sir Warrior Opara, Dan Satch Opara, and Godwin Kabaka Opara went for a wild Afropop that combined indigenous guitar hooks with the putatively Zairean rhythms then sweeping the continent. Unlike the Ibo hits preserved on Vertigo's long-lost African Music comp, the four-minute 1973-1974 songs are gentle and charming only in comparison to the 18-minute mid-'80s tours de force that follow. Natural soul disco from the heart of Africa, they don't relent until they fade into forever. Listening rather than dancing, your attention may wander for a minute or two, but whenever you tune back in, Dan Satch is coming at the guitar beat from yet another angle, or Sir Warrior is shouting out yet another variation on an eternal theme that transcends whatever tribal truism translation might provide--a confluence of body and spirit you wish touched those who would impoverish either, which always means both.

FALSE,A,Stankonia,OutKast,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5180,"
Comic and expansive, P-Funk were '60s from their psychedelic universalism to their rock dreams. OutKast are straight outta the Reaganism that immiserated underclass blacks who could still laugh at Star Child back when. They still take gangsta's Reaganomic equation of crime and self-help too seriously, which imparts cred as it narrows the grand good time they have whether they're petitioning their babygranny or loving deez hoez ""from the wigs to the fake eyes to the fake nails down to the toes."" But on this album their realism and high spirits drive each other higher. There's more bounce-to-the-ounce and less molasses in the jams, more delight and less braggadocio in the raps. Ever the happiness salesman, Big Boi would like you to know that every song has a hook. Dre's chief interest is the ideas. Drawl this very fast: ""Speeches only reaches those who already know about it/This is how we go about it.""

FALSE,A,Idlewild,OutKast,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13426,"
In a poetic biz snafu, the not-actually-a-soundtrack that got mixed reviews in periodicals with July deadlines was substantially revised for its Aug. 22 release. But due to the usual dumb critical systole-diastole plus the premature burial of Idlewild-the-movie, the backlash didn't stop there. Me, I liked it fine before catching the near-empty late show where I fell in love. Flick's a sepia-tone ""Moulin Rouge"" that makes just as much hash of musical historicity--Big Boi the bootlegger's nephew raps with a territory band, Andre the mortician's son ivory-tickles like he's studied Debussy and dreamed Monk. Record's a joyous mishmash, so light-spirited that rumors of OutKast's demise are irrelevant regardless of accuracy, which nobody can gauge anyway. The endless grindcore finale that bloats proceedings to 79 minutes is their stupidest track ever, and occasionally a forgettable song sets down and rests awhile. But from the mainstream hip-hop Big Boi articulates with so much muscle to the retro swing Andre sings just fine, they sound happy to parade their mastery. Also on parade: Janelle Monï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"

I always thought Pablo's great album was King Tubbys Meets Rockers Uptown, also due for enhanced reissue, but that was just his great dub album, because unlike most frequenters of the void that separates all notes, he also had a gift for whistling in the dark. Generally he pursued this pastime on his faithful melodica, but as someone who learned his trade sneaking into the school chapel to doodle on organ, he sometimes found a keyboard more melodic. Where his early hits were catchy novelties, by 1978 he was a natural mystic, and his first all-instrumental album sounds it. A strange, simplistic mood-music masterwork--calming, childish, and inexplicable.

FALSE,A,American Saturday Night,Brad Paisley,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14666,"
Here's an album where the marriage ballads are so meaty and convincing that the two exceptionally well-turned breakup songs seem like formal exercises, where a comedy number about fishing and beer would sound just dandy if there weren't so many subtler laughs on the agenda--like when the title number ends up in Manhattan, or when ""Welcome to the Future"" ends up on a synth outro, or when Paisley's rowdy guy friends join in on a hearty ""You wear the pants/Buddy good for you/We're so impressed/Whoop-de-do."" In short, here's an album from the capital of hits-and-filler where the filler could be somebody else's hits. As woman-friendly as Garth Brooks without the emo overkill, Paisley seems happier than ever, and I don't think it's just about his wife and kids. I think it's about Barack Obama. Listen carefully to ""Welcome to the Future"" and try to tell me I'm wrong. Then watch the video and hope Paisley isn't wrong either.

FALSE,A,Love and War,Brad Paisley,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17037,"
If you believe the only country superstar ever to record a pro-Obama song owes us an anti-Trump song, you're not getting it--not exactly. What you are getting is the antiwar title track, a John Fogerty collab that unites Iraq and Vietnam--and also, by extension, Syria and whatever else they got. And toward the back where the Christian gesture is usually tucked away you're also getting an anti-hate song that decries the evil done in God's name in both ""the darkest prison"" and ""the largest church,"" because after all, ""God is love."" That'll do, doncha think? This is easily Paisley's strongest album since American Saturday Night--not a bum track, loaded with good jokes (including, after several failed attempts, one about the internet), hymns to marriage haters will hate because they don't have what conjugal love takes, and, word of honor, a fun Mick Jagger cameo. It begins with something called ""Heaven South,"" which one kind of hater will dismiss as escapist piffle but I say is Paisley's way of telling another kind of hater to quit feeling sorry for themselves and be grateful for what they got. It ends by reprising the same song.

Faster and louder, slower and more reflective, better recorded with a better drummer, this five-song EP is where Elizabeth Nelson fully vents her contempt for the 60s, structural injustice, the 60s, escapist liberalism, a charismatic mentor who brainwashed her with reason, the 60s, and the musical style she and her husband mean to be better at than anybody else in the world except maybe Sleater-Kinney.

Compiled by UK music journo Roy Carr, this budget take on Parker's Dial sessions is findable cheap used and has become a favorite of mine by the odd strategy of skipping his twistiest heads. Although the two-disc Legendary Dial Masters is now collector-priced, longer Dial collections designated 1 and 2 are buyable as separate items, and the first consists almost entirely of originals that include the omitted ""Dexterity,"" ""Bongo Bop,"" and ""Dewey Square"" although not ""Scrapple From the Apple."" Worth owning. But in keeping with a generic title the label employed for many lesser jazz comps, what happens here is different. Midway through, originals give way to standards that begin with an ""All the Things You Are"" that's as inspired as Parker ever got and damn right soulful. If he'd had the strength of mind, he could have broken pop as the king of the intelligent makeout instrumental without getting near a violin.

FALSE,A,Yardbird Suite: The Ultimate Charlie Parker Collection,Charlie Parker,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6043,"
Because Dial was where he changed history most consistently, 14 of these 38 tracks are also on The Legendary Dial Masters. But despite the redundancy, both newcomers and fans will find his first cross-label, legit-plus-bootleg survey a gratifyingly listenable addition to his discography--two and a half hours free of outtakes, vocalists, Norman Granz, and the other dumb distractions his admirers contend with. His alto pervades every track. Even the live strings belong.
"
FALSE,A,Howlin' Wind,Graham Parker,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1427,"
Parker builds his white r&amp;b of such familiar materials that it takes awhile for the songs to sort themselves out, but their fury is unmistakable--in the time-honored English manner, bass and drums play the house-rocking rhythms of Chicago and Detroit for righteous anger rather than good-time escape. Then songs come clear, marred at times by the white bluesman's chronic romanticism of the blood--""Gypsy Blood,"" to be precise--but so passionate that every personal animus takes dead aim at the great world. Parker's ""strange religion/Without any God"" may well be himself. But when he instructs the Lord not to ask him questions, he doesn't extend the prohibition to Graham Parker.
"
FALSE,A,Heat Treatment,Graham Parker,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1426,"
Parker doesn't just have the makings of a major artist, he is one. Because his more reflective and/or accusatory tendencies here show up his rather narrow timbral and melodic range, this isn't quite as engaging as Howlin Wind. Even the verve of the Rumour's arrangements and Parker's deft and pithy way with vernacular speech don't entirely redeem ""Black Honey"" or ""Help Me Shake It."" But the sound is a lot fuller, and the defiance in the face of social collapse more bracing as a result.

FALSE,A,Squeezing Out Sparks,Graham Parker and the Rumour,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1429,"
An amazing record. Parker's mood, which has narrowed into existential rage with a circumstantial root, makes for perfect, untamable rock and roll. Guitar, drums, vocals, lyrics, and hooks (and more hooks) mesh into ten songs so compelling that you're grateful to the relative lightweights for giving you a chance to relax. And if Graham is pissed off merely because he's not a big star yet, he translates his frustrations into credible, emotionally healthy anger--the kind you feel when they can't fit the real news into print.

FALSE,A,Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome,Parliament,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2670,"
This seems like your representative 'delicment LP at first, featuring one irresistible and quite eccentric dance cut, other dance cuts that are at moments even more eccentric (including one based on nursery rhymes), bits of inspired jive, bits of plain jive, and an anomalous slow one. But with familiarity the three rhythm hooks that anchor the album start sounding definitive. And never before has George Clinton dealt so coherently with his familiar message, in which the forces of life--autonomous intelligence, a childlike openness, sexual energy, and humor--defeat those of death: by seduction if possible, by force if necessary.

FALSE,A,"Greatest Hits: P. Funk, Uncut Funk, the Bomb",Parliament,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2674,"
Clinton, Collins, Worrell &amp; Co. always saved their funnest riffs (and scored their smashest hits) for P-Funk's kiddie half, which means that these radio-length condensations of the peaks toward which their concerts unwound (and around which their albums cohered) constitute their most tuneful and atypical LP. In a band that made a point of prolonging foreplay, it's like a serial climax, and the effect can be exhausting and even disorienting. But as you might imagine, it's also very exciting, an opportunity to concentrate on the deep vertical pleasures of music that makes forward motion a first principle. And as you ought to know, it was always the dense layering of whomever's guitar, Worrell's keyboards, Collins's bass, and Clinton's crafty vocal arrangements that made their forward motion stick.

Figure the all-jam, all-slack Monastic Living for a metal-machine stumble that sets up this crazy-feeling leap forward--not just driven drones, spare tunes, and catchy sprechgesang, but an album where their art dreams for their straight talk come true. ""One Man, No City"" really does say something about urban alienation, ""Captive of the Sun"" about megapolitan avantism, ""Steady on My Mind"" about long love, ""Berlin Got Blurry"" about missing someone, ""Two Dead Cops"" about police brutality, ""Paraphrased,"" I mean it, about signification and its disconnects.

Thank producer Danger Mouse for the heat, clarity, and structural detail that intensify an album where nine tracks add keyboard to the kind of punky g-g-b-d tunes these Texans rode into New York on only five years ago. Their aural gestalt will never be on a Stones-Ramones level, but those are the comparisons--in an appalling year when too many g-g-b-d types have chosen to gaze inward, I doubt we'll hear a greater album. Not only is it sinewy and flexible--that's a funk groove propelling a title song that celebrates the woke meme it also looks askance at--but the lyrics are sharper than ever. As usual, A. Savage is the political philosopher, Austin Brown the ""Get love when you find it / It's the only thing we have to fight with"" guy. So where Savage valorizes the square term ""collective"" in two different songs, the Brown who lost a sister in a car crash insists that the nearness of death changes everything else you think you know. Prescriptive or expressive, visceral or oppositional, neither guy ever quits.

The clear little voice is camouflage, just like the big tits. When she's wronged, as she is in five of this record's six sexual encounters (four permanently premarital, one in which hubby throws her into a ""mental institution""), her soprano breaks into a cracked vibrato that for me symbolizes her prefeminist pride in her human failings (""Just Because I'm a Woman"") and eccentricities (""Just the Way I Am""). Not all of these mini-soaps are perfectly realized and ""In the Ghetto"" is a mistake. But as far as I'm concerned she rescues ""How Great Thou Art"" from both Elvis and George Beverly Shea, maybe because a non-believer like me is free to note that the one who ruined her only happy love affair (with her fella Joe and her dog Gypsy, both of whom die) was the Guy in the Sky.

Though no outsider wants to believe it, they're not just the latest scruffy rumor. And though no insider wants to believe it, they're more well-schooled than inspired--skilled, gifted, of enduring artistic value, condensing a decade of indie thrashing about into a two-year recording career that takes off with their debut album. Always good at both tune and noise, they sacrifice you-know-what for you-know-what now that they're thinking about quitting their day jobs, and as you'd expect, the content is formal: noise doesn't give up without a fight, often it fights hard, sometimes it fights dirty, and tune digs where it's coming from. Yielding a message complex enough to offer hope that the lyrics--more bemused than enraged, more depressive than despairing--will catch up.

Whether the tunes come out and smack you in the kisser or rise from the clatter like a forgotten promise, this is a tour de force melodywise, which is not to get dewy-eyed about its market potential. They'll never truly sell out until they take voice lessons--as alternarockers from Stipe to Cobain know full well, soulful strength is the pop audience's bottom line. Me, I find their eternally pubescent croaks and whinnies exceedingly apt, and though in theory I always prefer songs that aren't about music, any bunch of obscurantist jokers who can inject the words ""Stone Temple Pilots they're elegant bachelors"" into my hum matrix have got a right to sing the rocks.

Despite their disavowals of ""progress,"" this proceeds as you'd figure--toward lyricism rather than commerciality or some such chimera. It's seldom hard or fast or chaotic, and if it was their sacred mission to humanize guitar noise, they've betrayed it like the reprobates they no doubt are. But if their vocation is beguiling song-music that doesn't sound like anything else or create its own rut, this reinforces one's gut feeling that they can do it forever. They can't, of course--nobody can. But the illusion of eternity has been music's sacred mission for a good long time.

Mature or die is the whole of the law. So of course there's no longer much insurgency in their ill-mannered sounds, now deployed to serenade a self-sustaining subculture and celebrate a band's collective success. Moderate tempos that once breathed psychedelic wooze turn reflective if not thoughtful as lyrics reference the material emoluments of middle-class life. Yet it's still exciting, because it isn't dragged under by the nagging disappointments that generally dull such music (and security). As convinced ironists, Pavement never expected anything else. Closure is a chimera--they'll drink to that. Onetime insurgent Thelonious Monk--they'll drink to him, too. A man known for his brilliant corners.

Because I trust the way Ubu's visionary humor and crackpot commitment rocks out and/or hooks in for the sheer pleasure of it, I'm willing to go with their excursions into musique concrete, and on this record they get me somewhere. The death of Peter Laughner may well have deprived America of its greatest punk band, but the subsequent ascendancy of synth wizard Allen Ravenstine has defined a survival-prone community capable of bridging the '60s and the '80s without acting as if the '70s never happened. Imitating randomness by tucking randomlike sounds into deep but tactfully casual structures, joyfully confusing organic and inorganic sounds, they teach us how to live in the industrial shift--imaginatively!

FALSE,A,The Tenement Year,Pere Ubu,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2724,"
Yes, this is Ubu--four of the seven players were on Dub Housing. But before Scott Krauss was brought in--can't expect much backbeat with Chris Cutler hogging the drums--it was also the most recent edition of David Thomas's Pedestrians/Wooden Birds making a rock move. So what's astonishing isn't just the high spirits and good faith, both rare enough on reunions, but the singleness of purpose. It's not as if Thomas's crotchety nature-boy mysticism has been blown away--one of these songs is an attack on zoos. But the momentum of the backbeat and the electric clamor of the whole move straighten him out and toughen him up, while at the same time his loving, surrealistic sarcasm dominates the music, with Allen Ravenstine reaching untold heights of kooky reintegration. This record proves not only that good-hearted eccentrics can live in the world, but that they can change it for the better. Every song stays with you, but the one for the ages is ""We Have the Technology,"" which leaves you thinking that we just may and we just may not. Thank you, Scott Krauss.

Subtly bopping the essence of blues growl and juke-joint thrust, he was more adult, more regional, and more threatening than the Everlys or Buddy Holly. That's one reason he so quickly became a specialty taste artistically and a Nashville born-againer commercially, beloved by guitar adepts and romanticizers of Dixie-fried fundamentalism but legendary for one definitive song only. The guitar people have a point--while no James Burton, he had more jam than Scotty Moore and would have gotten where he got without Moore or his big boss man. But if that's all there was to him, he'd deserve to be a specialty taste. It's the songwriting that has reach. ""Blue Suede Shoes"" aside, these ditties seem to be trifles. Say you will when you won't. Put your cat clothes on. Or your pink pedal pushers. So now you try to do it--in 2:46, 2:48, and 2:25 respectively.

Conscious rather than correct, without a hint of hardcore's parricidal/misogynistic hysteria, these seven songs are constricted and expansive, sour and ebullient all at once.

Truth in promotion is their byword--the complete singles is what you're gonna get even if they're also the greatest album tracks.

For all his ""I've been a teenager since before you were born,"" Neil Tennant finally seems, well, ready to love--finally seems to comprehend that needing another human being is more than an experiment you perform on your feelings, a way to insure that you'll not only be ravished but ravished exquisitely. Convinced cornballs may still find his emotions attenuated, but I say the production values suit the tumult in his heart and the melodies the sweetness in his soul.

She's a rebel, and if all goes well, also a pathfinder, which isn't certain mainly because the acts and attitudes that make her a rebel are so normal. Her number of partners may be over toward the right side of the bell curve. She may have commitment problems. But for at least two decades, bohemian women of a certain age have displayed this much desire, independence, bitchiness, self-doubt, and general weirdness--while continuing to pin down the unmanly emotional apercus that make ""Dance of the Seven Veils"" and ""Divorce Song"" so gender-specific. They can behave this way if they want--they're just not supposed to come out of the closet about it. And while Phair knows more than enough about tunes and guitars to challenge the taboo, the weirdness level of her spare, intuitive, insinuating demos-plus is bohemia-specific. Which is apt for sure. But not necessarily pathfinding.

In which a girl-rock shooting star seeks recognition as nothing more but nothing less than the imaginative, eccentric singer-songwriter she always was. Her perspective remains distinctly female even when she's impersonating men.

This isn't an indie babe's album, or a blowjob queen's either. It's the work of an artist testing her capacity for fictional scenarios, of an upper-middle-class woman well past worrying why she fucks and runs--in public, at least. Its spare, halting, impractical, distinct, blatantly hooked sound honors the home demo over the bar raveup because it was invented by someone who shares an indigenous habitat with record geeks--the kind of bedroom that's longer on stereo equipment than ceiling mirrors.

But the half of this gratifying selection that started on Milan--including ""Tanguedia 3"" and ""Los Sueï¿½ï¿"" both reprised for American Clave--packs a full measure of dynamic sophistication and high drama, and as Grace Jones or Yo-Yo Ma could tell you, ""Libertango"" is just where to begin.

Which makes this meeting of L.A. Reid's double-platinum Philadelphia white girl and justly forgotten 4 Non Blondes emoter Linda Perry even more of a feat. These are pop songs in the sense that they deliver their payloads in 90 seconds. But they're also confessional, dark, downtempo--and, OK, a little gauche sometimes, which just makes them seem realer.  Despite Pink's audacious claim that she's not as pretty as ""damn Britney Spears,"" celebrity anxiety takes a backseat to a credible personal pain rooted in credible family travails, a pain held at bay by expression. Artistically, it's a next step for a genre I never thought would take one. I wish I believed Justin Timberlake's solo debut will sound half as honest, frustrated, and fulfilled.

FALSE,A,The Truth About Love,Pink,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15776,"
Proving you can get as much variety out of a tempestuous marriage as out of the bar life your temporary breakups leave on the table, Pink and her 21 collaborators fashion a recorded image of her feisty, heartfelt, all-over-the-place love/sex life. Until the last two songs, whose overwrought drama I don't have to like just because I trust its verisimilitude, they hit every time. The comic-only-not title track is perfect if not necessarily the truth, followed for me by the introductory ""Are We All We Are"" (its title transformed into a chorus-chanted hide-and-seek readymade) and the see-ya ""Slut Like You"" (""I'm not a slut/I just love love""). Then again, I'm a known sucker for feisty. So note that I'm also taken with the acoustic duet she shares with fellow babymama Lily Allen. And although it's true that I'd rather hear Robyn sing ""Try,"" it's also true that I think ""Try"" is good enough for Robyn.

Slight, bright, and perfect--Ramones for bad girls, country edition. The ringleader is Miranda Lambert in ""Gunpowder &amp; Lead"" mode, but they're definitely a trio--Ashley Monroe has a co-write on seven of Lambert's eight songs and Angaleena Presley's ""Lemon Drop"" is the catchiest of all even if she stole it from John Prine, as is her damn right. After the gold-digging title track, they're poorer than punks even on ""Takin' Pills,"" a road song about three bad girls making their career move. Chirping their expertly executed tunes, scorning the guitar swagger good old boys think makes them so sexy, they're a pop cartoon worth more than gold. Dig?

Did Miranda Lambert/Ashley Monroe/Angaleena Presley, as the composer credits on 13 of these 14 songs put it, come up with the ""Jesus is the bread of life / Without him we're toast"" opener or lift it from some rakish evangelist I'm too provincial to know about? I wouldn't rule the evangelist out, because while the writing is every bit as sharp as on their near-perfect 2011 debut, these bad-girl and mad-wife nuggets take sin seriously. ""Stop Drop and Roll One"" and ""Got My Name Changed Back"" retain the threesome's signature devil-may-care. But there's a deep sadness in ""When I Was His Wife""s been-there-don't-do-that, ""Leavers Lullabye""'s love-ain't-enough, ""Best Years of My Life""'s ""hankering for intellectual emptiness,"" and the blood, sweat, and bitterness of ""5 Acres of Turnips."" ""Cheyenne"" envies a gal who can take love or leave it, ""Milkman"" wishes Mama had cheated, and ""Commissary"" is so glad the abuser folks fronted for got beaten to a pulp in jail. Even the steadfastly unharmonious path to enduring matrimony laid out by the closing ""This Too Shall Pass"" suggests the wisdom of maturity. Why am I not surprised the woman who did herself a favor by shitcanning Blake Shelton didn't pitch in on it?

Though the words are less willful, they're still mostly indecipherable without the crib sheet and still mostly incomprehensible with it--leisure-class kiddies grasping at straws (or women: Black Francis has gone through three girlfriends by cut five) as the solar system bangs and whimpers to a halt. But these collegians are obscurantists no longer. Announcing their newfound religious faith with a surf-metal instrumental (""Cecilia Ann,"" who's not a girlfriend though Francis loves her best of all), they march out tunes so simple and confident and power riffs so grandly declamatory that you learn to understand the choruses by singing them. The beats are lively. The three-minute songs don't bash you over the head with their punk/pop brevity. Neither do the two-minute songs. If they weren't still a little gothic-surrealist they might even be too easy--but they ain't.

The title tune is the catchiest of the 23, but not by much: just one more piece of sensationalism, its fingernail grip on profundity pried away by the unpretentious business sense of a comeback-keyed one-disc best-of.

A great band at half the age and three-quarters the speed, they fended off the dreary horror of Prague '68 with a sardonic despond that the routine oppressions of Prague '78 ground toward somber mysticism. Eventually, as happens with sects right and wrong, their fellowship soured, and only by decree of their artist president did they regroup for democracy at this gig. But though they could still play the sax-viola-guitar-keybs-gripe top and bass-forward bottom of their old music, they weren't miserable enough to recreate its mood. At a clip that suited their existential confidence and funkier, younger drummer, their spiritual alienation fell away to reveal the sonic singularity that gave it form--a Reed-Zappa amalgam so Euro it makes a nominal blues seem like sleaze for an old Elmore Leonard flick, and so intent on forward motion that the part writing only spurs it on its way.

Half of Egon Bondy's Happy Hearts Club Banned, that crucial early salvo in the former Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, is scattered through these two discs. That one still sounds glorious on its own. But it's no more likely to be reissued separately than Take a Look at Those Cakes. The long-gone live reunion album 1997, so guitar-heavy you can hear it dreaming of arena-rock glory, has only nine of these 31 selections. And although I miss the Leading Horses finale ""Osip,"" this captures the band more persuasively than either of the six post-Bondy albums I've heard. The mood is eerie and sardonic, and the unchronological song order tracks like a Tarantino movie. Unobliged now to penetrate their considerable political significance, which got too Catholic anyway, I'm free to immerse in the bearlike vocals, jazzlike saxophone, unstinting drive, and gloomy harmonic devices of my favorite prog band. Can and Faust are noodling wimps by comparison.

FALSE,A,Enchanted: The Best of the Platters,The Platters,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15910,"
It's arguable that the most successful vocal group of the '50s by far--20 top 40 pop hits between 1955 and 1961--weren't doowop at all. They never sang on street corners, that's for sure. And although they started at King, their hits were on a major label, Mercury, overseen by a songwriter named Buck Ram who insisted Mercury market them on its pop rather than ""race"" imprint. All but one featured Tony Williams, a funny-looking little dude with a precise, melodramatictenor. Ram's piano triplets on their breakout ""Only You"" inspired a Stan Freberg parody, and his ""When I feel your charm/It's like a fourth alarm"" was one of the worst couplets of the decade. But the Platters' half-heartsong, half-heartbreak oeuvre proved romance needn't be adolescent or evanescent, and although Williams is dismissed as Jackie Wilson writ small, I prefer him just because he doesn't have what it takes to go all operatic on his timeless standards and period originals. This hitches up three collectors' items from the group's post-Williams and -Ram incarnation where Bing Crosby, Tommy Dorsey, and Ink Spots covers should be. But ""Smoke Gets in You Eyes"" remains, as it must. Zora Taylor's ingenue lead on the early-'57 ""He's Mine"" is girl-group before the Chantels. And where do you think Chrissie Hynde got her band name? Some Jackson Browne album? Or ""The Great Pretender,"" which she thrilled to as a horny youth?

Not only is their mind excursion less threatening than Hammer, it embraces the Beatles and Spandau Ballet with a nerdy passion that might have been designed to assuage white consciences and fears. I doubt it, though--listen true and its escapism seems not willful but willed, Prince Be's deft, thought-out response to a world that bugs him politically, spiritually, existentially, and because he's fat. This is rap that's totally idiosyncratic, yet so lost in music it's got total outreach--moving effortlessly from speech to song, the quiet storm of sweet hooks and soft beats surprises like prime Big Star or XTC, only it's never brittle or arch. The sharpest synthesis since Prince, who we should probably start calling Prince Fuck just to keep our teen spirits straight.

Success has transformed Prince Be from stereo potato into overweight lover, a phrase he lifts without attribution, and like all his multifarious appropriations, this one fits him like a caftan--flatteringly, commodiously, with room to move around. Truth, sincerity, and so forth are probably present and definitely beside the point. Whether he's rapping or crooning, boasting or begging, dishing out a verbal beatdown or plumbing the sacred essence of ""Norwegian Wood,"" his aesthetic constructs are their own socially significant reason for being. As long as he's circumspect enough to allude to his mysterious religious beliefs rather than promulgate them, he'll be a force for good in a world that generates too many misfits and not enough b-e-a-u-t-y.

""And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda"" comes from Australian folkie Eric Bogle, one of the least commanding singers in any hemisphere you care to name, but its tale of Gallipoli is long as life and wicked as sin and Shane MacGowan never lets go of it for a second: he tests the flavor of each word before spitting it out. I associate this technique with producer Elvis Costello, who probably deserves credit as well for the album's clear, simple musical shape. But none of it would mean much without the songs--some borrowed, some traditional, and some proof that MacGowan can roll out bitter blarney with the best of his role models. Try ""The Old Main Drag,"" about Irish lads tricking, or ""The Sick Bed of Cuchulain,"" about Irish heroes dying.

This moderately astonishing bunch of songs begins with a long series of homely oxymorons and a fable about not going to hell--both a bit overworked I think, both probably up front to deflect the hard news not quite specified by the title except insofar as it uses the C-word at all. Because as one track after another then bangs home, the middle class this coal miner's daughter knows from life is up against it. From the line at the grocery store to the life of last night's party taking the long way home in her high heels, nobody's quite getting by. ""Dry County Blues"" is about meth, ""Pain Pills"" about opioids, ""Drunk"" about that guitar player who made her an all too honest woman after she got ""Knocked Up."" Shit-shooting Pistol Annie Presley is grim and acerbic and kind all at once. And she sings pretty as you please.

I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but I have news for you--that's not why he's worshiped as a god today. He's worshiped as a god today because in addition to inventing rock and roll he was the greatest ballad singer this side of Frank Sinatra--because the spiritual translucence and reined-in gut sexuality of his slow weeper and torchy pop blues still activate the hormones and slavish devotion of millions of female human beings worldwide. Beginning and ending with the schlock masterpieces ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" and ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" and rescuing tracks from such renowned works of phonographic art as the Viva Las Vegas EP, the Spinout soundtrack, and the Something for Everybody album, this may not be a religious experience, but it comes close. My only real complaint is Peggy Lee's (not Little Willie John's) ""Fever."" Because in this company I really miss ""It's Now or Never.""

In a pop environment where even honest artists make a virtue of fabrication, Chrissie Hynde expresses herself. Her fierce, instinctive independence makes even Joan Jett's aggressiveness seem like a pose; unlike Patti Smith, she doesn't append an avant-garde escape clause to her deal with the rock and roll verities. Accessible though they are, her song structures follow no formula anyone else could copy, growing spontaneously (she tells us) out of a personal rhythmic relationship to beats and riffs much too powerful and uncute to be called hooks, which is what they are. Since she has the sense of humor of your average ayatollah, her self-righteousness can be a drag--this is her best album because the radio audience keeps her in line. But she's so tough that there's no reason to think it's her testament.

FALSE,A,Zooma Zooma: The Best of Louis Prima,Louis Prima,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15362,"
A Vegas fixture for a quarter century before he died at 67 in 1978, this Storyville-born Sicilian singer-trumpeter shared his entertainment philosophy as well as his Christian name with Armstrong and Jordan. He crossed over r&amp;b with 1950's ""Oh, Babe!"" but it was the honking tenor and rough vocal cameos of his compatriot Sam Butera that added rock and roll anti-class to a jazz act that pitted Prima's jocular leads against the sensible musicality of his consort Keely Smith. Prima was a go-for-the-gut clown whose signature musical tactic was to intersperse flat-out novelties like ""Robin Hood"" and ""Jump, Jive an' Wail"" with two-song medleys that moved the crap-shooting punters on to ""I Ain't Got Nobody"" before ""Just a Gigolo"" got old. Since 1990, when Rhino assembled these 18 tracks (14 on cassette, remember that one?), there have been more straight reissues, reshuffled comps, radio transcriptions, and live exhumations than I want to hear or count. More likely to cost four bucks than the 40 some chiselers are charging, this out-of-print 18-track laff-fest is probably the best, probably because it keeps the rock market in mind. The best alternative I've heard is the 1991 Capitol Collectors Series, which has eight more tracks but omits the nostalgic ""Robin Hood"" and the fat ""Them There Eyes""/""Honeysuckle Rose."" Forget Capitol's 26-track 2007 Jump, Jive an' Wail: The Essential Louis Prima, with its non-NAACP ""Civilization (Bongo Bongo Bongo),"" pre-IIADL ""Luigi,"" and bored run-throughs of ""Hello Dolly"" and ""Cabaret.""

After going gold in 1979 as an utterly uncrossedover falsetto love man, he takes care of the songwriting, transmutes the persona, revs up the guitar, muscles into the vocals, leans down hard on a rock-steady, funk-tinged four-four, and conceptualizes--about sex, mostly. Thus he becomes the first commercially viable artist in a decade to claim the visionary high ground of Lennon and Dylan and Hendrix (and Jim Morrison), whose rebel turf has been ceded to such marginal heroes-by-fiat as Patti Smith and John Rotten-Lydon. Brashly lubricious where the typical love man plays the lead in ""He's So Shy,"" he specializes here in full-fledged fuckbook fantasies--the kid sleeps with his sister and digs it, sleeps with his girlfriend's boyfriend and doesn't, stops a wedding by gamahuching the bride on her way to church. Mick Jagger should fold up his penis and go home.

After two or three plays, convinced that ""P Control"" and ""Endorphinmachine"" slam harder than any hip hop I've heard in years, I shrugged and recalled that, after all, I already knew he was the most gifted recording artist of the era. But this album documents more than professional genius rampant--all of them do that. This album is a renewal. It's as sex-obsessed as ever, only with more juice--""Shhh"" and ""319"" especially pack the kind of porno jolt sexy music rarely gets near and hard music never does. And you'd best believe ""Shhh"" and 319"" are hard--not for years has the auteur (as opposed to some hired gat) sounded so black, and not for years has the guitarist sounded so rock. As for the ballads, they suffer only by their failure to dominate. One of them has already stormed the radio--and another, good for him, takes too many risks to follow.

The main thing wrong with this record is that it's too short at 77 minutes: character sketches like Kool Keith's ordnance man, Big Daddy Kane's pimp, and Chubb Rock's crime lord could easily be fleshed out. Deploying hip hop stereotypes of mythic proportions in a coherent fable, it isn't just one of the few hip hop albums ever to make you look forward to the next skit--it's the closest thing to a true rock opera you've ever heard. So root for Chris Rock to turn it into the movie few optioned properties become. And note that while the full meaning of the title track, for instance, depends on the story, the songs hold up when you program around the skits. I'm not claiming Tommy Boy can break the steady-funking Albert King jam ""What U Got,"" where gangsta Sha and good kid Breeze have much love for each other. But I'm not claiming Sleater-Kinney's about to go gold, either.

Not that she isn't tough--there's viral video of her dousing a racist drunk with hot soup on the L train.

You suspect at first that these standard riffs and reliable rhythms are designed to support the lyrics rather than accompany them. But the homespun sarcasm of singing that comes on as tuneless as the tunes themselves soon reveals itself as an authentic, rather catchy extension of Nashville and Appalachia--and then so do the tunes, and the riffs, and the rhythms. Anyway, the lyrics are worth accompanying--not the literary corn of the absurdly overpraised ""Sam Stone,"" but the cross-generational empathy of ""Hello in There"" and ""Angel from Montgomery,"" the heartland hippieism of ""Illegal Smile"" and ""Spanish Pipedream."" And Arif Mardin hooks up ""Pretty Good"" pretty good.

Prine is described as surrealistic and/or political even though the passion of his literalness is matched only by that of his detachment: inferential leaps and tall songs do not a dreamscape make, and Prine offers neither program nor protest. It's the odd actions of everyday detail--as in the ""four way stop dilemma"" of ""The Accident""--that heighten the reality of his songs, and his elementary insight that social circumstances do actually affect individual American lives that distinguishes him politically from his fellow workers. That's why when he finally writes his music-biz takeoff it's a beaut; that's why ""Christmas in Prison"" deserves to be carved on a wooden turkey.

There aren't 41 best Prine songs. There are 50, 60, maybe more; the only way to resolve quibbles would be a bigger box than commerce or decorum permits. And his catalogue's out there, with John Prine, Sweet Revenge, and Storm Windows durable favorites. But this is just the place to access his kind, comic, unassumingly surreal humanism. Prine's a lot friendlier than your average thriving old singer-songwriter (Young, Thompson, Cohen), and his disinclination to downplay his natural warmth or his folk-rock retro may make him impenetrable to victims of irony proficiency amnesia. But no one writing has a better feel for the American colloquial--its language, its culture, its life. Except maybe Bobbie Ann Mason.

Although ex-Heartbreaker Howie Epstein gets more hooks out of his acoustic warrior than his old boss is tossing off, his idea of radio-ready does leave one waiting for the guitarist to shut up already. But usually that's because you're impatient for the next line, and usually it's a winner--if anything, Prine's waggish pathos and lip-smacking Americanese have been whetted by the divorce that keeps nosing in where it's not wanted. Homely thematic/metaphorical leaps are a common structural device--first the TV is hollering at him, then his wife (""They already think my name is where in the hell you been""), then the voice in his head that won't leave him alone.

After two years of cancer treatments underwritten by George Strait's version of a throwaway written with Roger ""I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing"" Cook, the cheating songs and Nashville novelties on this duet album are a perfect way for Prine to keep his hand in until his muse feels as glad to be alive as he does. Every one of his helpmates--not just Trisha Yearwood and Emmylou Harris and Dolores Keane and Lucinda Williams, but creaky old Connie Smith and Melba Montgomery, and also feisty young Fiona Prine--pretties up his soundscape. But the costar is Iris DeMent, who kills on both the Bobby Braddock cornpone of ""(We're Not) The Jet Set"" (rhymes with ""Chevro-let set"") and the conflicted spouse-swapping of the impossible old George &amp; Melba hit ""Let's Invite Them Over""--as well as Prine's only new copyright, the title track, in which a husband and wife who love each other to death paint totally different pictures of their marriage.

Nor was I impressed by the failed ad campaign of a title, or the picture of a longhair defending the chasm between big bad city and vernal rave with a stiff finger and a big knife. But this is stupid in the very best way. The style of sensationalism is fireworks display--pinwheels and Roman candles and starbursts popping out of starbursts popping out of rockets midair.

Why is this record better than all other Professor Longhair records? Well, the backup is more sympathetic (sweet and sour horns) and the songs well-chosen (rhumbafied blues from Muddy Waters and Jay McNeely and Walter Horton) and Fess's tendency to waver off pitch on the vocals is turned to advantage (cf. Dr. John). Also, there aren't that many Professor Longhair records--two U.S. LPs total for the man who invented modern New Orleans piano. And now he's dead.

And indeed, a few of the new tunes are genre exercises and many of Fess's vocal deviations fail to qualify as the jazzy fantasias Goldman palms them off as. Nevertheless, his Longhair is better performed (as well as much better recorded) than Nighthawk's Mardi Gras in New Orleans oldies and a lot steadier than Harvest's Live on the Queen Mary. And though the hard, punchy drive of Alligator's Crawfish Fiesta makes for a more consistently exciting record, the lazy insouciance of the tempos and horn parts here sure feels like New Orleans to me.

A local hero or less for most of his life, rumba boogiemeister Roy Byrd is the greatest rock and roller ever to peak past 50. Yet although all his excellent albums seem to permute ""Bald Head,"" ""Tipitina,"" ""Hey Now Baby,"" the heaven-sent ""Big Chief,"" and a few others into a canon, this two-hour set is where to figure what comes next--the only LP it plows under is Rock 'n' Roll Gumbo, reissued in 1985 by an adoring George Winston. Its strength is '50s singles, all at least near-classic save an overproduced ""Big Chief,"" but I prefer the second disc, culled from the many ad hoc band sessions a belatedly feted 'Fess cut in the '70s. Not blues and not jazz and not exactly rock and roll, not as simple as Fats Domino or as popwise as Allen Toussaint or as schooled as James Booker, Longhair supposedly learned to play on a junked piano with an octave or two of surviving keys, and for the rest of his life he made that compass an infinitely expanding universe. His Latin-tinged time was on a par with Monk's, James Brown's, anyone's, and he was also a clown and a nut. If you've never heard him, you don't know as much as you think you do.

Don't let Richard Butler's heartfelt snarl and Vine Ely's pounding pulse stun you into thinking that this merely recapitulates a great formula. It's richer melodically, texturally, and emotionally: Butler's '70s-'60s mind games have evolved into the bitter double nostalgia of a reluctant romantic who half-believed in 1967 and then half-believed again in 1976. And if commitment gives him problems, at least he's passionate about sex. I loved the first Furs album because it seemed so disposable; I love this one because it doesn't.

All preemptive strikes to the contrary, this is a much better record than there was any reason to expect under the circumstances. It's not unusually inflated or self-involved, though its brutal pace does wear down eventually, it's got a sense of humor, not just from a Flav who keeps figuring stuff out, but from Chuck, whose ""Pollywanacraka"" message and voice--people keep bringing in Barry White or Isaac Hayes, but he's playing the pedagogue, not the love man, maybe some Reverend Ike figure--is the album's most surprising moment. And it's no more suspect ideologically than they've ever been, with the anti-Semitic provocation of ""Terrordome"" and the homophobic etiology of ""Meet the G That Killed Me,"" both objectionable and neither one as heinous or as explicit as it's made out to be, countered somewhat by a clumsy attempt at a pro-woman slant and the spectacularly sure-footed rush of ""Terrordome"" itself. Shtick their rebel music may be, but this is show business, and they still think harder than anybody else working their beat.

FALSE,A,Apocalypse 91 . . . The Enemy Strikes Black,Public Enemy,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2829,"
Hard, hard, hard--hard beats hard news, hard 'tude. Hard on the brother man (African slave traders, black rookies, dead gangstas, malt liquor addicts, Quiet Storm, Jet, and anybody who calls Flav ""nigga""). Trademark dissonances and quick-witted interactions are sui generis, yet it's so in-your-face spare and sneaky deliberate that it's further from Fear of a Black Planet than Black Planet was from Nation of Millions, which was a lot further than a nation of others noticed. Strong top to bottom, it could peak higher: the closest thing to a ""Bring the Noise"" or ""Terrordome"" or even ""911"" is that nigga song. Motto: ""Justice evolves only after injustice is defeated.""

FALSE,A,He Got Game,Public Enemy,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2832,"
Who better than the sports addict who wrote ""Air Hoodlum"" with no prompting from Spike Lee to comprehend and then control the soundtrack concept? Note, however, that for all the we're-back bluster and covertly sexist anti-r&amp;b rhetoric, the closest it gets to the stressful speed of classic PE is on one of the seven (of 12) songs Shocklee-Shocklee-Sadler didn't produce, the Danny Saber-Jack Dangers closer ""Go Cat Go."" Instead you'll hear backup femmes, churchy chorales, skeleton beats, Wu strings, more guest rappers than advertised, and funk samples, although these are outnumbered by hooks appropriated subtly (in fact, brilliantly) from ""James Bond Theme"" and the Who's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and blatantly (also brilliantly) from Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth."" On the latter, Steve Stills himself blubbers a climactic coda. Over-the-hill blowhards gotta stick together.

FALSE,A,Breakthrough,The Don Pullen-George Adams Quartet,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10315,"
Pullen, a prodigious pianist who can nail anything from r&amp;b to 12-tone, and Adams, a brawny tenor modernist with a taste for blues, have been gigging together since Charles Mingus's death left them bandless, and though I've missed their shows and regretfully filed their records (where? where?), I'm now convinced they've got the hottest working group in the music. Part of the evidence is the breakneck hour that constitutes Soul Note's Live at the Village Vanguard--Vol. 2, on which Pullen plays actual music at tempos that would put Yngwie Malmsteen in traction--McCoy Tyner telling Cecil Taylor jokes on reds, sort of. But this direct-metal-master recording has more to it, easing into ballad and samba between great dollops of high-speed virtuosity. The secret is symbiosis--Pullen makes Adams go out, while Adams discourages Pullen's shows of Tayloresque concert technique. Proving that the right synthesis of in-the-tradition tradition and avant-garde tradition is all the concept world-class jazz players need.

FALSE,A,Daytona,Pusha T,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17335,"
G.O.O.D. Music's weekly-EP gimmick was basically a neat excuse to fuck around and call it art. But as a compression device, the seven-song limit was perfect for framing and accentuating its CEO's narrow strengths in an opener the series never got near to topping. Pusha's verbal pride is a formal passion that rejects both excess and half measures as he enunciates every syllable in his impassive, sibilant flow, and no objective observer would deny how skilled he is at narrativizing the cocaine hustle. But where 45 minutes of his unflinching tales wear ordinary humans out, the EP format compels him to hone every line, as in, oh: ""If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money / Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy / This ain't really for you, this for the Goya Montoya / Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers."" It also helps that the label owner provides the hardest and simplest beats he's stooped to in years. And that Pusha hates Drake so much he compares him to Trump.
"
FALSE,A,Amplified,Q-Tip,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2846,"
Q-Tip's agenda is the hundred or so electrobeats that pulse identically for the first 20 seconds of the lead ""Wait Up,"" before he opens his mouth to announce a ""brand new page."" Thus does the man who made Ron Carter the embodiment of hip hop humanism assert his solo personality, and let the Quest fans who'll never forgive him catch arthritis and die. He gets stronger music out of hard beats than he ever did out of soft jazz, and those surprised by how much he likes sex are in denial. He's his own man, and vivrant for it.

FALSE,A,Jazz at Massey Hall,The Quintet,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15838,"
Date: 5/15/53. Length: 47 minutes. Place: Toronto, Ontario. Band: Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Charlie Mingus, Max Roach, and clandestine alto saxophonist Charlie ""Chan."" Never mind the apparently similar Diz N Bird at Carnegie Hall (24 minutes of a quintet that adds John Lewis, Al McKibbon, and Joe Harris to the two horns before turning into a big band record) or the hosannahed Town Hall, New York City, June 22, 1945 (38 Bird-Diz-Roach minutes substituting Parker's studio-favored Al Haig-Curly Russell piano-bass combo). Without question, this is live Bird numero uno even though the setlist belongs to Dizzy, including the inevitable (and dandy) ""Salt Peanuts"" and ""Night in Tunisia."" Parker's relaxed, bluesy mood is epitomized by a seriously interactive ""All the Things You Are"" that shifts bar-by-bar between virtuoso phrases and soulful here's-the-melody before dissolving into a ""52nd Street Theme"" breakdown. Gillespie is lyrical and incisive, Powell brings his A game, Roach thunders like no post-swing drummer working, and Mingus's bass is the most expressive in classic bebop. O Canada!

FALSE,A,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,Ma Rainey,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11465,"
Like most records of the '20s this 14-cut disc isn't exactly a pleasure to hear. Yazoo's pressing adds detail, brightness, and what may be an even-up trade--surface noise--to Milestone's five-duplication twofer. Nor is the material all one could hope for--""Prove It On Me Blues"" would have provided both a jug band and a lesbian credo. But this is one artist whose history is made to be served. Too country to be semirespectably ""classic"" even though Fletcher Henderson, Coleman Hawkins, and Don Redman show up among her sidemen, she's not so somber as gruff on the down blues she's best known for, and she also kids around. In short, she's more rock and roll than Bessie Smith.
"
FALSE,A,Give It Up,Bonnie Raitt,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=403,"
Raitt's laid-back style (shades of John Hurt and John Hammond, touches of Aretha Franklin and Bessie Smith) is unique in its active maturity, intelligence, and warmth. With Chris Smither's ""Love Me Like a Man"" (""lyrics adapted by Bonnie Raitt"") and Sippie Wallace's ""You Got to Know How"" she dares any crotch-rocker to match her sexual expertise. On Joel Zoss's ""Stayed Too Long at the Fair"" and Jackson Browne's ""Under the Falling Sky"" she dares any sensitive type to wax lyrical without a drum kit. And on her own ""You Told Me Baby"" and ""Nothing Seems to Matter"" she invites Lenny Welch to return the favor.
"
FALSE,A,Home Plate,Bonnie Raitt,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=405,"
Produced with much tape trickery and laying on of experts by Paul Rothchild, this defeats its own gloss by refining and expanding the conventions of emotive, projective ""sincerity"" that have informed pop music from Al Jolson to Linda Ronstadt. By her thoughtful phrasing and gentle-to-gritty timbre, by her understated dramatic presence, by the songs she chooses to sing, Raitt makes her ""compassion"" seem unsentimental and even sharp-tongued without any loss of outreach. I love every cut, from John and Johanna Hall's ""Good Enough,"" her most alluring analysis of a long-term sexual relationship yet, to John David Souther's ""Run Like a Thief,"" which is about going to bed with your best friend's mate.
"
FALSE,A,Luck of the Draw,Bonnie Raitt,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=410,"
One reason it took Raitt two decades to achieve the El Lay iconicity she deserves is her resistance to both folk gentility and studio antisepsis. So praise Don Was for humanizing the control-freak production values she could never get on top of in the '70s. Another is her moral seriousness. So praise songwriters like John Hiatt, Bonnie Hayes, and maybe even Paul Brady for combining heft with hookcraft, and Shirley Eikhard, whoever she is, for ""Something to Talk About,"" the slyest distillation of this rowdy Quaker's sexy ways since ""Love Me Like a Man."" But after that tell Raitt that no commercial reservation should ever torpedo a ""Tangled and Dark,"" about a deep, long wrangle with love itself, or an ""All at Once,"" about losing the teenage daughter she's never literally had. It's like the guitar she's afraid she hasn't properly mastered--she stops writing at the risk of her own intelligence, idiosyncrasy, and reality.
"
FALSE,A,Ramones,Ramones,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3795,"
I love this record--love it--even though I know these boys flirt with images of brutality (Nazi especially) in much the same way ""Midnight Rambler"" flirts with rape. You couldn't say they condone any nasties, natch--they merely suggest that the power of their music has some fairly ominous sources and tap those sources even as they offer the suggestion. This makes me uneasy. But my theory has always been that good rock and roll should damn well make you uneasy, and the sheer pleasure of this stuff--which of course elicits howls of pain from the good old rock and roll crowd--is undeniable. For me, it blows everything else off the radio: it's clean the way the Dolls never were, sprightly the way the Velvets never were, and just plain listenable the way Black Sabbath never was. And I hear it cost $6400 to put on plastic.

FALSE,A,Ramones Leave Home,Ramones,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3794,"

FALSE,A,Rocket to Russia,Ramones,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3796,"
Having revealed how much you can take out and still have rock and roll, they now explore how much you can put back in and still have Ramones. Not that they've returned so very much--a few relatively obvious melodies, a few relatively obvious vocals. But that's enough. Yes, folks, there's something for everyone on this ready-made punk-rock classic. Stoopidity, both celebrated and satirized. Love (thwarted) and social protest (they would seem to oppose DDT). Inspired revivals (the Trashmen) and banal cover versions (Bette Midler and Cass Elliott beat them to ""Do You Wanna Dance?""). And, for their record company and the ears of the world, an actual potential hit. If ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker"" was the most significant number eighty-four in history, what will ""Rockaway Beach"" do for number twenty? (Did I hear five?)
"
FALSE,A,Road to Ruin,Ramones,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3797,"
Like any great group, this one is always topping itself. Album four alternates definitive high-speed rockers--""I Wanted Everything,"" ""I'm Against It,"" and ""She's the One"" are as good as any they've ever done--with more candidly lyrical slow ones that rank with the oldie, ""Needles and Pins,"" as compositions. The lyrics of ""I Just Want to Have Something to Do"" and ""I Wanna Be Sedated"" test the barrier between their Queens-geek personas and their real lives as professional musicians without a hint of rocky-road bullshit. Only the ""Bad Brain"" (a title) theme seems repetitious--personally, I'm glad it's fading. But the guitar breaks bring tears to my personal eyes, and I await Gary Stewart's version of ""Questioningly.""

FALSE,A,Too Tough to Die,Ramones,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3801,"
Who would have thunk it? With Tommy producing again after five years, these teen-identified professionals (mean age: thirty-three) make a great album, with the cleansing minimalism of their original conception evoked and honestly augmented rather than recycled--just like their unjudgmental fondness for their fellow teen-identifieds. This time the commercial direction is more metal than pop, but satanists they ain't: just as Joey came up with punk's most useful anti-KKK song, here Dee Dee comes up with punk's most useful anti-Reagan song. Dee Dee also imitates Bugs Bunny on steroids on two well-placed hardcore parodies and provides the first single's salutory lyrical hook: ""I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor.""

FALSE,A,Blues Masters: The Very Best of Jimmy Reed,Jimmy Reed,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1710,"
He was a paragon of mush-mouthed warmth and congenial ineptitude, the crudest hitmaker in pop history and one of the bestselling bluesmen ever. People pretend to understand how he happened, but they don't. Sure the boogie shuffle Eddie Taylor got out of his guitar was new and inviting, but was it novel, or compelling? And Fats Domino, a plausible analogy, was infinitely cleaner and slicker. Rhino's selection includes the prized ""Odds and Ends,"" in which a violinist on shore leave from the Chicago Symphony goes crazy and can't figure out how to get back. Seems like a parable, only what exactly is the point? The point is that with Jimmy Reed, you never know.
"
FALSE,A,The Blue Mask,Lou Reed,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2150,"
After this becomes a cult classic, in a week or so, noncultists are gonna start complaining. ""My Dedalus to your Bloom/Was such a perfect wit""? And then bringing in ""perfect"" again for a rhyme? What kind of ""spirit of pure poetry"" is that? One that honors the way people really talk. Never has Lou sounded more Ginsbergian, more let-it-all-hang-out than on this, his most controlled, plainspoken, deeply felt, and uninhibited album. Even his unnecessarily ideological heterosexuality is more an expression of mood than a statement of policy; he sounds glad to be alive, so that horror and pain become occasions for courage and eloquence as well as bitterness and sarcasm. Every song comes at the world from a slightly different angle, and every one makes the others stronger. Reed's voice--precise, conversational, stirring whether offhand or inspirational--sings his love of language itself, with Fernando Saunders's bass articulating his tenderness and the guitars of Robert Quine and Reed himself slashing out with an anger he understands better all the time.
"
FALSE,A,Legendary Hearts,Lou Reed,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2151,"
If The Blue Mask was a tonic, the follow-up's a long drink of water, trading impact and intensity for the stated goal of this (final?) phase of Reed's music: continuity, making do, the long haul. The greatest songs on The Blue Mask honored the extremes he was learning to live without while ""My House"" and the like copped to the implicit sentimentality of his resolution. Here both ends approach the middle. ""Legendary Hearts"" and ""Betrayed"" clarify Reed's commitment by laying out the down side of romantic marriage; ""Bottoming Out"" and ""The Last Shot"" and the elegiac ""Home of the Brave"" excise melodrama from his waves of fear. Equally important, ""Martial Law"" and ""Don't Talk to Me About Work"" and the almost, well, liberal ""Powwow"" prove that sometimes his great new band is just a way for him to write great new songs, which is what his endurance had better be about in the end.
"
FALSE,A,New Sensations,Lou Reed,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2152,"
This wonderful record feels like product at first--a solid but expedient bunch of songs like The Bells or Coney Island Baby or even Sally Can't Dance. Although the title cut is definitely the centerpiece, and thematic at that, there are no grand statements like ""Women"" or ""Legendary Hearts"" and no tours de force like ""The Gun"" or ""Betrayed."" And boy, does it sneak up on you. Instead of straining fruitlessly to top himself, Reed has settled into a pattern as satisfying as what he had going with the Velvets, though by definition it isn't as epochal. The music is simple and inevitable, and even the sarcastic songs are good sarcastic songs, with many of the others avoiding type altogether. Think he can keep doing this till he's fifty? Hope so.
"
FALSE,A,Ecstasy,Lou Reed,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2159,"
Despite a few bloopers, including a love-equals-time metaphor he worked out for a Robert Wilson thingy, this is the album we hoped he'd make the first time we heard The Blue Mask--one of them, anyway. Disillusioned yet again to discover that the object of his affections is almost as fucked up as he is, Reed returns to the scene of his Oedipus complex while Roto-rooting the internal contradictions of enduring romance from every angle he can think of. But there's more regret than rage, and no sense of finality, as if he's been through too much to stay mean. And note that his relationships endure, including the one with Mike Rathke, Fernando Saunders, and Tony Smith, now the longest-running band of his roving career. With Lou's guitar firmly at the helm, they impart something like tragic beauty not just to intended soul-shakers like ""Ecstasy"" and the 18-minute ""Possum,"" but to the existentialist joke ""The Modern Dance"" and the cheater's diatribe ""Mad""--which I call the most original song on the record even if Reed prefers the one about the white slave and the black master.
"
FALSE,A,Document,R.E.M.,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2920,"
Their commercial breakthrough eschews escapism without surrendering structural obliqueness, and after six years of mushmouth I wouldn't have thought it possible either. Maybe they finally figured out that intelligibility doesn't equal closure (can't, actually). Or maybe they just wanted to make sure everyone knew how pissed off they were. In any case, these dreamsongs are nightmares of a world in flames, the kind you remember in all their scary inconsistency because you woke up sweating in the middle. How it will all end I couldn't say, but it's a healthy sign that their discovery of the outside world has sharpened their sense of humor along with everything else. Inspirational Title: ""It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine).""
"
FALSE,A,Out of Time,R.E.M.,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2923,"
Hiding political tics behind faux-formalist boilerplate, pop aesthetes accused them of imposing Solidarity and Agent Orange on their musical material, but in fact such subjects signaled an other-directedness as healthy as Michael Stipe's newfound elocution. Admittedly, with this one beginning ""The world is collapsing around our ears,"" I wondered briefly whether ""Losing My Religion"" was about music itself, but when Stipe says they thought about calling it Love Songs, he's not just mumbling ""Dixie."" Being R.E.M., they mean to capture moods or limn relationships rather than describe feelings or, God knows, incidents, and while some will find the music too pleasing, it matches the words hurt for hurt and surge for surge. The Kate Pierson cameos, the cellos, and Mark Bingham's organic string arrangements are Murmur without walls--beauty worthy of DeBarge, of the sweetest soukous, of a massed choir singing ""I Want To Know What Love Is.""

Like a bit of great modern rock and roll only more so, Richman's surprising return to his senses plays havoc with all notions of artistic maturity. It couldn't have happened if he hadn't finally grown up, but it wouldn't have been half as striking if he'd relinquished his kiddie lyricism in the bargain. ""Not Yet Three,"" ""The Neighbors,"" and the admonitory campfire anthem ""That Summer Feeling"" have the magical complexity of masterworks without the reassuringly forbidding aura of mastery, generating just enough authority to shore up lesser songs that might have seemed merely eccentric on their own. Granted, without the disarmingly precise backup of Ellie Marshall and Beth Harrington, Jonathan's singing might have seemed merely eccentric as well. It doesn't.

FALSE,A,Diary of a Mod Housewife,Amy Rigby,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=112,"
Personalizing the political for a bohemia that coexists oh so neatly with structural underemployment, thinking harder about marriage than a dozen Nashville homilizers, the ex-Sham leaves the comforts of amateurism for an ex-Car and some El Lay roots-rockers, throwing her voice around in the process. All the ones you notice at first--the Berryesque ""20 Questions,"" the chartworthy ""Beer and Kisses,"" the lovelorn ""Knapsack,"" and the thematic ""The Good Girls""--were laid down in California. But the ones you don't notice you remember, including the five where she returns to reliable locals like Tony Maimone, Doug Wygal, and her hub, who in his real-life version even gets to bang things on a couple of songs. Concept album of the year.

FALSE,A,Little Fugitive,Amy Rigby,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13027,"
Trying to be hardheaded, I ask myself how the soul-horned ""It's Not Safe"" or the wan ""Always With Me"" would sound on an album by someone similar I don't care for--Aimee Mann, or Gillian Welch. The answer is that a differently arranged ""It's Not Safe"" would be a highlight for either, and that the mournful ""Always With Me"" is there for mood and pace. A cover sticker quotes the claim that she's as consistent as Richard Thompson or John Prine, but Thompson hasn't been her match lyrically for decades, and Prine, bless his heart, has recorded one album of new material since 1995. It really is quite simple--no one of any gender or generation has written as many good songs in Rigby's realistic postfolk mode since she launched Diary of a Mod Housewife in 1996. She's the best, plus a fine singer in an apt doing-the-dishes mode. Not counting the heart-tugging ""Dancing With Joey Ramone,"" my current fave is ""So You Know Now,"" in which a beloved tells her perfect man how she was once a slut. ""Year of the Binge"" could be about the same woman. Who almost certainly isn't Rigby--when would she have had the time? But the mod ex-housewife knows her well.
"
FALSE,A,Anti (Deluxe Edition),Rihanna,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16735,"
The reason I like this record beginning to end has zip to do with whether it documents her sexual mood swings more proudly or soulfully. The presentational Rihanna is so unlike anyone I know that she can say anything she wants about her musical punany as long as she leaves Chris Brown out of it--with this artist, sex is figurative, symbolic, the mark of a pleasure taker turned pleasure provider. So Anti is her best album for a reason so simple it's tautological--despite its supposed rejection of track-and-hook mechanics, it features catchier songs. True, the main time they really make me go woo is when she breaks into gibberish at the end of ""Work."" But then some German hands her ""Love on the Brain,"" the best new doowop song in decades, which segues perfectly to a power entreaty avec drunk violins, after which the album proper goes out on a piano-enhanced coda that adds a nice sweetness. Only instead of savoring this narrative arc, why don't you just proceed to the three bonus tracks, which top an M.I.A. move with none other than ""Sex With Me""?

FALSE,A,The Execution of All Things,Rilo Kiley,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11885,"
Beloved of her cult, in part simply because it's early but also because it's mild, this is where Jenny Lewis begins her run as one of the '00s' hardest-hitting songwriters. Really, mild she's not. Her great subject is triumph over depression, exemplified by the magnificent ""A Better Son/Daughter,"" where she's on the march long before she's made forthright her m.o. Even ""My Slumbering Heart,"" which describes dreams any man worth sleeping with would be proud to lie there and listen to, hints at the nightmares of everyday life. Insofar as that man is partner Blake Sennett, however, he is admittedly kind of mild.
"
FALSE,A,Under the Blacklight,Rilo Kiley,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13833,"
Terse and beaty, with Dr. Dre referral Mike Elizondo going half on the baby, this isn't a pop record, but it does avoid guitar-band shapes, sonics and truisms. Blake Sennett's pretty Fleetwood Mac homage proves densely political, and though Jenny Lewis isn't writing fluff, she might consider some porn in the right venue for the right advance. Makes you wonder just what teenager was ""down for almost anything,"" what adult is getting ""money for sex."" Leaves little doubt that it's Jenny's tail you can chase and tongue you can taste in the Spanish one, Jenny who removes her bra and smokes in bed in the sexy(est) one. The tender title tune casts her as a ""black widow,"" and the tender-sounding opener is a breakup song as triumphant as ""Breakin' Up"" itself. ""Ooh, it feels good to be free,"" she exults, with girl backup. It's possible she means it.

FALSE,A,RKives,Rilo Kiley,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15965,"
Seven of these 16 outtakes etc. were recorded along with Rilo Kiley's reflexively underrated 2007 swan song Under the Blacklight--the one where Jenny Lewis &amp; Co. consorted with chart-proven beatmaker-producer Mike Elizondo. Another three accompanied their underachieving 2004 succ?s d'estime More Adventurous--the one where they were so vulgar as to risk Warner Bros. distribution. And near as I can hear, all that marks these terrific songs as outtakes etc. is that they're slightly less produced and dramatic. Lewis's melodic facility, vocal ductility, psychological acuity, and verbal dexterity never peak as high as on UTB or MA while maintaining an altitude that few song bands ever reach. May I recommend ""Let Me Back In,"" about wanderlust; ""A Town Called Luckey,"" about 30 as middle age; ""Bury, Bury, Bury Another,"" about work, love, and death. May I recommend the greasy Too Short cameo on the ""Dejalo"" remix. May I recommend the handclapped closer ""The Frug"": ""And I can do the frug/I can do the robocop/I can do the Freddy/I cannot do the smurf/And I can hate your girl/I can tell you she's real pretty/I can take my clothes off/I cannot fall in love.""

This attempt to fuse TRB's music-hall cheer with postpunk postfunk isn't as innovative as its sources, but it comes across better on record. Robinson has always flattened his flair for melody under one-dimensional rhythms and vocal attack, but here the arty touches--that is, Stevie B.'s perverse little guitar parts--serve what I'd call a ""commercial"" function if only the record were selling better. And who ever said politics and propaganda were the same thing?

FALSE,A,The Voice of Lightness Vol. 2: Congo Classics 1977-1993,Tabu Ley Rochereau,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15230,"
With Mobutu squeezing every fantasy of affluence out of Congolese life as he strove to consolidate his power, soukous's greatest vocalist felt the pinch as recording studios, pressing plants, and his own label broke down. And though his velvet tenor remained strong and flexible as he turned 40 and then 50, his spirit faltered. As usual, Ken Braun makes the most of a discographical briar patch, most of it originally released as dance-length two-sided 45s. There's nothing approaching a clinker on these two CDs--mourning a teacher or going disco, Tabu Ley remains an ineradicable rumba original, a lover of melody and leader of men. But only at the start of disc two does the music enter the transcendant realm where the first volume lives: with ""Kabasele in Memoriam"" and ""Lisanga Ya Banganga,"" both long known to American soukous fans from Franco &amp; Rochereau's Omona Wapi, whose other two tracks woudld flow right in as well. Conclusion: although Rochereau has lived a longer and happier life, his rival and coequal probably lived an edgier and deeper one.

FALSE,A,The Roches,The Roches,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3828,"
Robert Fripp's austere production of this witty, pretty music not only abjures alien instrumentation but also plays up the quirks of the Roches' less-than-commanding voices and acoustic guitars. Thus it underscores their vulnerability and occasional desperation and counteracts their flirtations with the coy and the fey. The result is not a perfect record, but rather one whose imperfections are lovingly mitigated. Replete with memorable melodies, heartbreaking harmonies, wise words, and lotsa laffs.

For a long time they seemed strangers in their own music, distracted by some purist superego whispering in their ears about acoustic guitars. Here their pop style hasn't changed that much--it's a little more eclectic, if anything. But it could almost be growing out of their three consanguineous voices; they sound as natural and gorgeous as the Comedian Harmonists, Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross, maybe even the Judds. So when the words don't kick in right off, just immerse in the sound until they do, because they will. Pained smiles replace nervous giggles not because they've lost their sense of humor, but because Suzzy has finally gotten sick of her own whimsy, because the '90s are even less fun than the '80s, because you can't live with them and you can't live without them, and because they thought following ""You're the One"" with ""You're the Two"" was feminist comedy enow.

Rodgers isn't the most accessible of totems--read Nolan Porterfield on his ""raw energy"" and ""driving"" guitar and you'll think somebody made a mistake at the pressing plant. But he didn't invent country music being a purist. He was the first to put into practice the retrospectively obvious truth that Southerners wanted more from their music than hymns, reels, and high-mountain laments--blues voicings and pop tunes and even a little jazz, though most of these classics are strictly solo. Also, he yodeled, a sound that encompasses the restless bad-boy escapism of ""The Brakeman's Blues"" and ""Pistol Packin' Papa,"" which fortunately for rock and rollers predominates, and the dreamy good-boy nostalgia of ""Dear Old Sunny South by the Sea"" and ""My Old Pal,"" without which he wouldn't have meant spit in T-for-Texas or T-for-Tennessee. Also encompassing both is ""Waiting for a Train,"" as signal a Depression song as ""Brother Can You Spare a Dime."" It was recorded in 1928.

Having seen the world like a true railroad man, Rodgers moved beyond hillbilly showbiz (Dave Macon, Frank Hutchison) without stooping to respectability (Bradley Kincaid, Vernon Dalhart). Thus he spawned tens of thousands of singers who sounded like themselves as they sang at the whole round world, and their collective achievement dulled our ear for his originality. With the country space he opened up so crowded, what can it mean to say that he outsang all but a few of his progeny? Maybe, as Bob Dylan says, ""his refined style . . . is too cryptic to pin down."" But inventors have a way of conveying that they're inventing something. So start with his diffident sense of hip, sincere and sly at the same time, anticipating two crucial structures of feeling: the laid-back and the cool. Add that he was also exuberant in there somewhere. Don't forget that yodel. Mention that he could swing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ la Merle or Lefty when he wanted.

Released mid-2017 U.S. but early-2016 Australia, this sounds more New Zealand--Chills-Clean-Bats, bright young white guys whose trebly guitars purl and mesh, although Go-Betweens recitative enters as well. If you like the effect--and why not, it's beautiful--you'll gravitate to it on sound alone. But what I'm loving at least as much is lyrics that suit the bright white male culture the sound implies. Seven tracks lasting half an hour include four courtship songs that dig so deep and sweet into that adventure that the titles alone evoke their smarts and heart: ""Tender Is the Neck,"" ""Heard You're Moving,"" ""Write Back."" The fourth title, ""Wide Eyes,"" is less evocative, so here's the whole couplet: ""Been drivin' cross the country [a big deal in Australia] / Just to see those wide eyes."" Then there's ""Career,"" which is not a love song and may even be a tragedy--or a dark comedy.

From titles like ""Bitch"" and ""Sister Morphine"" and (the one Altamont reference) ""Dead Flowers"" through ""Brown Sugar""'s compulsively ironic and bacchanalian exploitation/expose to the almost Yeatsian ""Moonlight Mile,"" this is unregenerate Stones. The token sincerity of ""Wild Horses"" drags me.

The Stones' best album since Exile on Main Street is also their easiest since Let It Bleed or before. They haven't gone for a knockdown uptempo classic, a ""Brown Sugar"" or ""Jumping Jack Flash""--just straight rock and roll unencumbered by horn sections or Billy Preston. Even Jagger takes a relatively direct approach, and if he retains any credibility for you after six years of dicking around, there should be no agonizing over whether you like this record, no waiting for tunes to kick in. Lyrically, there are some bad moments--especially on the title cut, which is too fucking indirect to suit me--but in general the abrasiveness seems personal, earned, unposed, and the vulnerability more genuine than ever. Also, the band is a real good one--especially the drummer.

Dreaming of solo glory, Mick doesn't have much time for his band these days--just plugged into his Stones mode and spewed whatever he had to spew, adding lyrics and a few key musical ideas to tracks Ron and Keith completed before the star sullied his consciousness with them. And I say let him express himself elsewhere. For once his lyrics are impulsive and confused, two-faced by habit rather than design, the straightest reports he can offer from the top he's so lonely at, about oppressing and being oppressed rather than geopolitical contradiction. In the three that lead side two, always playing dirty is getting to him, as is his misuse of the jerks and greaseballs and fuckers and dumb-asses who clean up after him, yet for all his privilege he's another nuclear subject who's got no say over whether he rots or pops even though he'd much prefer the former. Especially together with the hard advice of ""Hold Back,"" these are songs of conscience well-known sons of bitches can get away with. Coproducer Steve Lillywhite combines high-detail arena-rock with back-to-basics commitment and limits the melismatic affectations that have turned so much of Mick's late work in on itself. Let him have his own life and career, I don't care. What I want is the Stones as an idea that belongs to history, that's mine as much as theirs. This is it.

But this much knottier 1965 session is the Rollins I keep going back to. The man is expansive here, too--casually interpolating rapt modal runs into his thoughtful thematic improvisations on the 16-minute title tour de force, for instance--but the context is more angular, with continual commentary by Billy Higgins (who shares the drumming with Mickey Roker) that erases the memory of Tony Williams's work on Don't Stop the Carnival. Also knotty is the question of who owns this music--Rollins has claimed in court that ABC had no right to release it.

Not that the sound hasn't proved malleable and even protean, but its direct, expressive warmth and raspy power is unmistakable even to noninitiates like me. His most accessible and uncompromised album in more than a decade is soaked in the swinging pan-Caribbean ""calypso"" that's been his special pleasure since the '50s; despite drummer Tommy Campbell's elaborations it moves the rock and roller in me.

Integrating 11 rappers into a groove defined by ?uestlove's spontaneous bop beatery and lowing synth sounds that evoke My Bloody Valentine the way those high ostinatos used to give it up to Roy Ayers, this is as pleasurable as prime OutKast or Kanye West. The mood is political even though the rhymes barely reference any arm of government except the police. The Roots are no more sympathetic to the suicide bomber than to the killer nerd of Virginia Tech, both of whom share a song with a boy soldier in Sierra Leone they're not crazy about either. But they know that just by reporting what they see and feel, they indict the government. With an incongruent Fall Out Boy track set aside for single duty and all those rappers a dream community taking the burden off Black Thought, this is the most accomplished pure hip-hop album in years.

It's not like hop-hop and anxiety are strangers. But usually that means the mortal fear epitomized by the Notorious B.I.G., or the rampaging neuroses dramatized by Eminem, or the hand-to-mouth worries some alt-rappers cop to. Here it's garden-variety upper-middle-class anxiety. What's next? Am I doing the right thing? Can I pass my accomplishments on to my kids? Is the economy about to go phlooey? Is God on my side? Is God on anyone's side? These are exactly the querulous feelings associated with the alt-rock famously present on the Roots' ninth album in the form of the Dirty Projectors, the Monsters of Folk, and the perfectly sampled Joanna Newsom. Difference is, complex-rhyming Black Thought and his many gifted guest MCs express them more directly, thoughtfully, eloquently, and entertainingly than any of those tyros. And then they up the ante and confront their anxieties with a fortitude and even optimism embodied by Kamal Gray's keyboards, never my idea of this band's strenth, and, especially, ?uestlove's drums. I love sampled beats. But 90 percent of the time I'd rather ride Ahmir Thompson's hand, feet, and brain.

I've never thought average guys were compelled to ape the ruling class, I don't believe romance is inevitably corrupted, and the collapse of European culture is long overdue. In short, what Bryan Ferry has to say has never spoken very loud to this listener no matter how you break it down. So while others may mourn the nuance and conceptual integrity of Stranded and Country Life and Siren, I get off on this compilation, which puts his dialectic on display in its most entertaining guises. What with all the popcraft and robot energy and campy asides--and genuine emotion and ideas--I was even inspired to listen to ""A Song for Europe"" from beginning to end.

Use your programming buttons--the jumbled order, intended like the title to conceal how over they are, cheats them instead. Played chronologically, the music coheres--their style evolves naturally, switching gears only when they begin sweating street cred--and the rhymes lay out a tragedy. A pair of streetwise college kids inveigh against a scourge before anybody has an inkling it's going to happen. Preaching and demonstrating self-reliance, they start with a beatbox and two stentorian voices--""Unemployment at a record high""--and then incorporate just enough guitar to turn the market around. As they get famous, their boasts begin to sound out of touch--live '83 they're all camaraderie, live '84 it's already like the audience is down there somewhere--and by '87 or so their message seems formulaic. But given their bona fides, it retains a certain credibility--even the useless 1989 spiel ""Pause"" (rhymes with ""Don't break laws"") sounds like them. By the time they check out with the scary tale of a crack shooting on ""The Ave.,"" they're packing nines--and unemployment 1983-style seems like heaven, or at least not-hell.

Utilitarian, which suits them. At least it's sequenced with a sense of continuity, and unlike the deleted Profile job, it abjures remixes, live collectibles, and Back From Hell. Sure Run-D.M.C. and Raising Hell  are good-to-excellent historical artifacts that render it superfluous. But what no one dares say is that by the standards of the aesthetic they made possible Run-D.M.C. are a little crude. Their rock-solid funk is more Memphis than New Orleans, their declamation the opposite of flow as Rakim defined it, their blunt rhyming neither spontaneous beat prosody nor the blaxploitation real of gangsta's true lies. In fact, for such big influences their straightforward sound is kind of unique, and their greatness harder to hear than it's supposed to be. On these 17 tracks, the consistency and reliability their hard-working music implied is a reality worthy of the lower-middle-class 'hood they represented.

And who recognizes Kaz's name, of course--confessional songpoet, acoustic guitar buried in El Lay cliches when he tried to get his songs out there himself. Believe me, indie-rock irony improves the type. Whether or not this sensitive young man Can Love, at least now the mooniness is under control, and access to technology enables him to make his own noise. Barlow's labyrinthine welter of demos-for-sale includes five previous so-called albums. In 1990, with Eric Gaffney sowing chaos every track he got and Jason Loewenstein's civilizing influence an alternative eon away, he was heard to derogate ""the 'repeat the chorus three times' deal.""

In which a prolific, unknown Chicago rapper plays every part but one on a loosely chronological song cycle about a naive young rapper named Scotty, who laps over into Serengeti himself, and a much older white working-class sports fan named Kenny Dennis, whose passion for Brian Dennehy provides the album its title and his signature track its chorus: ""Favorite actor Dennehy, favorite drink O'Doul's/Bears, Hawks, Sox, Bulls."" (Given Kenny's accent, this rhymes perfect.) Over soul loops for Kenny and basement beats for Scotty, both rhyme about their day to day enthusiasms and travails. It's funny, not satirical--Serengeti loves these characters. And like Kenny, he also loves Kenny's wife Jueles, whose occasional background yakking is rendered by Serengeti's friend Larissa Poluchowicz with what sounds to me like a Polish-American accent, though internal evidence indicates Jueles is of Mexican descent. Maybe she's both--since Serengeti is a ""noticeably Negro"" man born David Cohn, that would compute fine. And in case you're wondering, ""noticeably Negro"" is Serengeti's phrase--the title of a 2006 album worth seeking out. There are others.

Get this straight: no matter what the chicmongers want to believe, to call this band dangerous is more than a suave existentialist compliment. They mean no good. It won't do to pass off Rotten's hatred and disgust as role-playing--the gusto of the performance is too convincing. Which is why this is such an impressive record. The forbidden ideas from which Rotten makes songs take on undeniable truth value, whether one is sympathetic (""Holidays in the Sun"" is a hysterically frightening vision of global economics) or filled with loathing (""Bodies,"" an indictment from which Rotten doesn't altogether exclude himself, is effectively anti-abortion, anti-woman, and anti-sex). These ideas must be dealt with, and can be expected to affect the way fans think and behave. The chief limitation on their power is the music, which can get heavy occasionally, but the only real question is how many American kids might feel the way Rotten does, and where he and they will go next. I wonder--but I also worry.

Circa 1980, just after these Soul Train trainees pushed off the blocks, ""urban"" was reghettoized on the radio. So they did their best to appear not just pop but rock; whether they were that other thing wasn't discussed in polite company. Only now can we say it loud--they were disco.

New thing's answer to Hendrix and McLaughlin circa 1970 and Material's embodiment of creative chaos circa 1980 sits in a studio and plays some tunes--sometimes more than one at a time, either counterpointed or strung together in a suite. Like so many jazz avant-gardists, Sharrock got his start in r&amp;b, and you can tell--with the bullshit cut away he's both funky and beautiful.

So where Ronald Shannon Jackson is a jazz composer exploring rock colors (and sometimes rhythms), Sharrock has the priorities of a genius son of Jimi and Jimmy. An atmospheric Kate Bush tribute that eventually gains momentum is as arty as this gorgeously straightforward guitar record gets, and though no one will mistake the Sanders cover for ""Eight Miles High,"" it's in the tradition.

This trick is greatly facilitated by Billy Joe's knack for the simple tune and an unassuming vocal affect that makes each one sound like he made it up in the shower after sleeping in his clothes. It also helps that ""Son of Calvary,"" ""You Just Can't Beat Jesus Christ,"" and ""Live Forever"" are followed by 10 earthbound numbers that culminate with ""The Earth Rolls On,"" which could be about Eddy and could be the woman who has him bouncing down the street in ""Love Is So Sweet.""

For Simon, the r&amp;b-derived mbaqanga he and his South African sidemen--guitarist Ray Phiri, fretless bassist Baghiti Kumalo, and drummer Isaac Mtshali, all players of conspicuous responsiveness and imagination--put through their Tin Pan Alley paces seems to represent a renewed sense of faith and connectedness after the finely wrought dead end of Hearts and Bones. The singing has lost none of its studied wimpiness, and he still writes like an English major, but this is the first album he's ever recorded rhythm tracks first, and it gives up a groove so buoyant you could float a loan to Zimbabwe on it. Despite the personalized cameo for Sun City scab Linda Ronstadt (a slap in the face to the ANC whether he admits it or not) and the avoidance of political lyrics elsewhere, he's found his ""shot of redemption,"" escaping alienation without denying its continuing truth.

The mood is melancholy. yet suffused with gratitude--for his wife's love first of all, but even more for God's gifts, with the Divinity Himself an actor in several lyrics and close by in most of the others. Fundamentally general and speculative language is always pinned down by a specific or two--a blizzard near Chicago, Jay-Z hawking Roc-a-Wear, a banker's pockets, a CAT scan and the Montauk Highway, gumbo in the pot and Dr. King shot, the form you have to fill out before you get into heaven. The music is the mild, irregular folk-rock he's explored for decades, graced with global colors that sound as natural as that guitar. I've had many disagreements with my homeboy Paulie, plus I'm an atheist. But here my main quarrel is the identity of the ""fragment of song"" whose title you can't quite recall as the Divinity Himself sets you ""swimming in an ocean of love.""

The Chairman on Reprise is a study in why artists shouldn't own record companies. My researches into a catalogue that runs to some 100 LPs have yet to uncover a single title that comes near the great Capitols, and the compilations are not to be trusted. So rather than spending $60 for the choppy 81-song box, try this 20-song oddity, supposedly programmed by Frank himself at age 79 and duplicating only seven box selections. It anoints more Don Costas than Nelson Riddles and is surprisingly scant on the Tin Pan Alley pantheon, the defining factor is tempo, almost always moderate or less, accentuating the autumnally ruminative mood of the songs and the old man who looked back on them so fondly. It ain't, to choose the Capitol remaster I've just glommed onto, Songs for Young Lovers/Swing Easy!

When he indulges himself, he doesn't dream symphonies like Goldie--he channels Chaka Khan and the Wu.

And underneath--muscle, ligament, cartilage, cardiovascular circuitry. The album moves the way you always hope jungle will, like a cross between a tiger and a snake, yet it's also a kind of mix record, with five showcases for Reprazent's serviceable MC Dynamite, who's as useful as the inevitable Method Man in the crucial matter of providing rap sounds.

One reason you know they're young is that they obviously believe they can rock and roll at this pitch forever. Whatever the verbal message of their intricate, deeply uptempo simplicity--less sexual angst, more rock-as-romance--it's overrun by their excited mastery and runaway glee. Like a new good lover the second or third time, they're so confident of their ability to please that they just can't stop. And this confidence is collective: Corin and Carrie chorus-trade like the two-headed girl, dashing and high-stepping around on Janet Weiss's shoulders. What a ride.

What's hard to get used to here, and what's also freshest and perhaps best, is how Corin and Carrie's voices intertwine--even reading the booklet it's hard to keep track of who's saying what to whom about what, as if they'd fallen in love with (or to) the Velvets' ""Murder Mystery."" Not that meanings would be crystalline in any case, or that they should be. With Cadallaca an outlet for Corin's girlish ways, S-K emerges as a diary of adulthood in all its encroaching intricacy. I mean, the guitars don't crunch like they used to either, and that's the very reason ""Get Up"" sounds like death and desire at the same time. The reason ""The Size of Our Love"" sounds like death, on the other hand, is that sometimes love is death. Nobody ever said maturity would be fun and games.

FALSE,A,One Beat,Sleater-Kinney,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11553,"
Sleater-Kinney is one of three unapologetically political bands to respond to September 2001's world-change with August 2002 albums, and it's remarkable how different they are. The Mekons are cynical and defiant; Springsteen is spiritual and uplifting. Yet both seem worn out, as if neither defiance nor uplift can get them out  of bed in the morning. Sleater-Kinney, on the other hand, go for defiant uplift and seem energized by the challenge. Probably it isn't the stance that energizes them--it's their energy that powers the stance. Not only are they a generation younger, they're riding the crest of a wild success burdened by neither the Mekons' quarter-century of subsistence nor Springsteen's felt responsibility to 10 million consumers--not to mention that Corin spent 2001 with her new baby, who plays a suitably small and crucial role in her September 11 song. Throughout they bubble and shriek--literally in the opener, where Corin's ""bubble in a sound wave"" is the secret of both social and nuclear fusion, and in the career guitar line Carrie lays under ""Oh!"" Let ""Step Aside"" do its thing and you'll ""shake a tail feather for peace and love"" no matter what your weary self thinks of protest songs.

Corin Tucker's abrasive warble is made for a Zeppelin move that seems inevitable now that it's here, and when the lyrics fail to mesh, or veer toward the sociologically corny, her proven ability to plow such quibbles is beefed up from the backup muscle. Nevertheless, the metal affinities are basically spiritual. Flaming Lips/Mercury Rev hand Dave Fridmann ain't John David Kalodner. Although the album is definitely loud, it's also raw, with no hint of the symphonic, yet at the same time it's a melodic highlight of an honorably tuneful catalog. And come down to it, the words are pretty good. I like the one about the boho losers. And the hungry-so-angry one. And the one that disses Interpol.

This return to the wars isn't necessarily their best album, but that it might be is an up in itself. Their pride is their joy, their standards are high, and they show no sign of getting back together because they could use the payday, although except for Carrie I expect they could--between its noisy desperation and its narrative detail, the clashing Corin opener ""Price Tag"" nails the overbooked constraints of the strapped middle class like she knows them by heart. Honed back down to punky three-minute songs because the leisure to stretch out is a luxury they can't presently afford, the music carries the seed of tumult to come, the sense that something or everything could explode without notice just the way this album did. My only cavil is that I wish the singing would relax more, even at the cost of softening the album's tension, and note that Carrie lets herself go that way on a kind of love song that links fame with mediocrity in the rare woe-I'm-a-star number fueled by emotions anyone can feel the point of.

Language Barrier was a world-music mishmash. Taxi Connection Live in London and The Sting are show and schlock reggae respectively. This is nonstop funk--powered by world pop's greatest rhythm section, which happens to be Jamaican, and filled out by a chauvinistic variation on Bill Laswell's usual international brigade--Daniel Ponce and Aiyb Dieng are the only furriners, although Henry Threadgill, Nicky Skopelitis, and D.S.T. aren't exactly from the same neighborhood. Art-rapper Rammelzee, Brooklyn toaster Shinehead, and studio mouthpiece Bernard Fowler add their lyrical signatures to those of P-Funk satellites Bootsy and Mudbone, but S&amp;R's sensationalism combines with Laswell's imperiousness to rock each side from its Ohio Players or Allen Toussaint intro.

Now that the truncated rhythms of Sly's post-dance-to-the-music have become the stomping ground of War (heavy) and Stevie Wonder (bubbling over), Sly takes the lyrics into middle-Dylan territory, exploiting his own genius for hook phrases--""in time,"" ""thankful n' thoughtful,"" ""babies makin' babies""--only to fasten a superabundance of elusive images to a jagged groove. Many of the songs turn in on themselves--one vaguely inspirational number ends with a derisive ""cha-cha-cha""--as Sly's vocals shift in tone, texture, and volume and the extra percussion and repeating horn riffs accentuate the music's brutally staccato effect. He seems willing once more to sing of love and fun, of gratitude and the great circle of life, but he also equates his legendary tardiness with his legendary self-destructiveness and comments on his inaccessibility as decisively as is appropriate. Plus a great twist in Sly's relationship with the white power structure: a cover of ""Que Sera, Sera.""

Huey Smith newbies beware: make sure the ""Rockin' Pneumonia"" on your confusing Spotify list or crappy-looking reissue runs 2:17 or so rather than 3:11 or so, because the longer version that now dominates both the streamosphere and online retail was cut for an Allen Toussaint who paid Huey even worse than Ace's Johnny Vincent--in the '70s no less, when the poor guy was up to his nose in Jehovah and failure and the endless slog of prying his money away from Johnny Vincent. My favorite Ace comp is Music Club's out-of-print 18-track This Is . . . Huey ""Piano"" Smith, still findable used if you're flush and quick; the 31-track Jax 501 with the same title as the one I'm featuring also looks good. But this more findable albeit shorter item covers most of the bases however much I miss ""Beatnik Blues"" and ""Pop-Eye"" and the nutty ""Would You Believe It (I Have a Cold)."" When his original cast of pranksters augmented his congenial chops and expert groove, piano maestro Smith had as much rock and roll in him as Fats Domino or Bo Diddley. Recording for hang-loose con man Vincent in Jackson rather than friendly professional Cosimo Matassa in New Orleans, he and his Clowns fell into an irreverent merriment in which collectivity was of the essence. His virtuosity and his commitment to fitting in were both so principled that they generated just plain fun in more ways than we can count, because that's the way that great prize just plain fun is.

I don't feel much intelligent sympathy for Smith's apocalyptic romanticism. Her ideas are as irrelevant to any social apocalypse I can envision as they are to my present as a well-adjusted, well-rewarded media professional. But Smith (in this manifestation) is a musician, not a philosopher. Music is different. The fact that I'm fairly obsessive about rock and roll indicates that on some sub-intellectual level I need a little apocalypse, just to keep my superego honest. That, of course, is exactly what she's trying to tell us. However questionable her apprehension of the surreal, the way she connects it with the youth cult/rock and roll nexus is revelation enough for now. This record loses her humor, but it gets the minimalist fury of her band and the revolutionary dimension of her singing just fine, and I haven't turned off any of the long arty cuts yet.

In a decisive and let us hope permanent change, there's none of the mawkishness young fools think is deep and old fools wallow in--not even in ""Play a Train Song,"" which appreciates corn without indulging in it. Instead a guy who spends two of these songs in jail sticks up for ""tree-huggin', love-makin', pro-choicin', gay-weddin', Widespread-diggin' hippies"" everywhere.

New one's better. If ""there's a war going on that the poor can't win,"" then it's Snider's genius to make you feel how for some people, freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose--cf. ""Looking for a Job,"" about a day worker who takes no shit, or ""Just Like Old Times,"" about a high school sweetheart turned hooker.

Yet for the third time since he kicked opiates in 2004, he's scored a full album's worth of new material that remains completely in a character unique to him while adding something new to that character. This time what's new is a band sound shambolically anchored by John Prine's New Orleans-raised drummer Paul Griffith and cunningly colored by fiddler Amanda Shires. What's also new but less surprising is an ever more explicit and uncompromising class animus. One song names the Abacus Fund Goldman Sachs and John Paulson conned unions with. Another begs to differ with the privileged canard that living well is the best revenge. Uh-uh, Snider sez. Revenge is the best revenge.

Finally, an album worthy of their tuning system, and no, it's not like they've suddenly started to write tight or see a shrink. All they cop to is making their bullshit signify, which means keeping a distance from the insanity they find so sexy and not letting their slack-jawed musings drone on too long. Hence, those with more moderate tastes have space to feel the buzz and a chance to go on to something else before boredom sets in. With the California punk cover acknowledging their debts and the bow to coherent content safeguarding against that empty feeling, their chief pleasure, as always, is formal--a guitar sound almost unique in its capacity to evoke rock and roll without implicating them in a history few youngish bands can bear up under these days.

Whatever exactly their lyrics are saying--not that I can't make them out, just that catch-phrases like ""You've got it"" and ""Just say yes"" and ""It's total trash"" and ""You're so soft you make me hard"" are all I need to know--their discordant never-let-up is a philosophical triumph.

""Youth Against Fascism"" is catchy indeed, but fun as it would be to hear ""I believe Anita Hill"" roaring from a passing boombox, I don't think it'll fly. And elsewhere it's gonna be tough extricating the hooks, which are more plentiful than ever, from the noise, which makes a comeback. Aurally as well as lyrically, this album earns its title.

Instead of distilling their weakness for experimental trash into noise-rock that sounds like a million bucks, they apply their skill at major-label compromise to their eternal propensity for experimental trash. After all this time, they know what they're doing when they fuck around, and their long-evolving rock and roll groove breaks down only when they have something better to do--there's nothing aleatory, accidental, or incompetent about it. Anyway, usually the groove holds; this is no Sister because it moves when it means to. Its unexpected noises are the marks of flesh-and-blood creatures thinking and feeling things neither you nor they have ever thought or felt before.

Songform guy that I am, it put me off at first.

In 1991 I wrote an atheistic gospel piece called ""With God on Their Side"" that I stand by. As death bears down, I may yet bend again toward the Lord, but I doubt it, and that's not why I returned to this 1992 CD I always admired and never penetrated. It's because I sensed in Rebert Harris a great voice that wasn't just for canary fanciers--a voice connoisseurs of normality could learn to love. I might never be a fan, I thought, but at least I could listen up close. Well, now I'm a fan, and not for the usual reasons. Harris is renowned for a falsetto he claimed incorrectly he'd invented and for an intensity that one way or another is gospel's currency. But what distinguishes both attractions is the restraint with which they're deployed. Yes he took flight, yes he got gritty and sweaty. Even at his most transported, however, he was always mellow--he always conveyed a core spiritual calm. And his time is uncanny, adding polyrhythm to quartet music that was always a cappella. Although a few of the lyrics have charms even for an unbeliever--""Everybody Ought to Love Their Soul,"" ""Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb""--they could be in Akan for all the difference they make in the musical moment. Except, that is, for ""Feel Like My Time Ain't Long,"" about parents dying, which doesn't mention the Lord once.

They're visceral where composition is cerebral and ambient is unmoored. They never fall for rock-techno's arena-scale gestures or art-techno's fatal conflation of thinking and mooning about.

Just how much American myth can be crammed into one song, or a dozen, about asking your girl to come take a ride? A lot, but not as much as romanticists of the doomed outsider believe. Springsteen needs to learn that operettic pomposity insults the Ronettes and that pseudotragic beautiful-loser fatalism insults us all. And around now I'd better add that the man avoids these quibbles at his best and simply runs them over the rest of the time. If ""She's the One"" fails the memory of Phil Spector's innocent grandeur, well, the title cut is the fulfillment of everything ""Be My Baby"" was about and lots more. Springsteen may well turn out to be one of those rare self-conscious primitives who gets away with it. In closing, two comments from my friends the Marcuses.

By depicting the fear of commitment as sheer terror, he does the impossible: renews L-O-V-E as pop subject.

For his entire three-decade ""career,"" the last half of which has had a distinctly not-for-profit aura, his own lyrics have celebrated the normality of his misfit life while his intense, eccentric, comic, loud, sincere vocal interpretations imparted to the widest range of pop songs ever negotiated by a single performer the beauty and wonder he originally discerned in Charlie Poole, Charlie Patton, and other icons of authenticity. Stampfel's enthusiasm is so unquenchable you figure he's got to be making fun of such understandably forgotten copyrights as ""Haunted Heart"" and ""Cry of the Wild Goose,"" and for sure he's not above it. But he is above belittling a song--any fun he may fashion from one is just another facet of its mystery. Stampfel the inveterate fakebook collector says he loves the chords of the impossible favorites he resuscitates here, and I believe him. I also believe he's such a sucker for music that once he falls for a progression he wants to tie the knot for life.

FALSE,A,Freedom Highway,Staple Singers,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15440,"
The genius of this one-of-a-kind family pop-gospel ensemble was guitarist-vocalist-patriarch Pops. Roebuck, as his mama called him, grew up on Dockery's Plantation in the Delta and heard the likes of Charley Patton and Howlin' Wolf many Saturdays in Clarksdale. But though his guitar always had more John Hurt than Rosetta Tharpe in it, blues was not his calling. Married by the time he migrated to Chicago in 1935, he worked hard jobs and moonlighted at music before gathering progeny Pervis, Yvonne, Cleotha, and Mavis Staples into a group in 1948. The Staples' mastery of gospel's old-time virtuosic melodrama is impressively documented on the 1956-61 Best of the Vee-Jay Years. But sensing a more expansive audience and aesthetic in the folk movement, Pops conceived the Milestone sessions on Great Day as the civil rights movement heated up between 1962 and 1964. Then the Staples moved on up to Epic and peaked. Vocals and guitar serving the song more than on Vee-Jay, tempos faster and steadier than on Milestone, they cheered up a mass movement with the certified classics it deserved: ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken,"" ""Wade in the Water,"" ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""This Train,"" and also ""For What It's Worth."" Mavis's growl provided essential bravura. But Pops's gentle baritone led structurally and defined the mood.

FALSE,A,Can't Buy a Thrill,Steely Dan,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3310,"
How about that--a good album with two hit singles attached. And as you might expect of New York natives who reside in the City of the Angels, both brim with ambivalence: ""Do It Again,"" a catchy modified mambo with homogenized vocals that divert one's attention from its tragic tale of a loser so compulsive he can't get himself hanged, and ""Reelin' in the Years,"" a hate song to a professed genius. Think of the Dan as the first post-boogie band: the beat swings more than it blasts or blisters, the chord changes defy our primitive subconscious expectations, and the lyrics underline their own difficulty--as well as the difficulty of the reality to which they refer--with arbitrary personal allusions, most of which are ruses.

With the replacement of lead singer David Palmer (who fit in like a cheerleader at a crap game) by composer-pianist-conversationalist Donald Fagen (who looks like he just got dressed to go out for the paper), they achieve a deceptively agreeable studio slickness--perfect licks that crackle and buzz when you listen hard, Grass Roots harmonies applied to words that are usually twisted. Not only does ""Bodhisattva"" come on like a jazzed-up ""Rock Around the Clock""--it shines like China and sparkles like Japan. But somehow I don't think Fagen really intends to hold hands with an Enlightened One, not even out of base curiosity.

Coming to hip-hop as an older outsider, moonlighting adman Steve Stein went for verbal meaning in his beat-based sound collages, the earliest of which--""The Payoff Mix,"" ""Lesson 2 (James Brown Mix)"" and ""Lesson 3 (History of Hip Hop),"" all collaborations with Stein's engineer buddy Double Dee--were as foundational for turntablism as ""The Message,"" and still sound as fresh. But he's in command of a wide range of black music--funk, soul, jazz, breakbeat and hip-hop (where his tastes run old-school and underground)--and his beats can make you chuckle. Steinski loves straight comedy and exploits an impressive store of datedly ""hip"" spoken-word records to add extra irony to the history he evokes and reproduces. Because he's always preferred the popular to the esoteric, his uncleared samples have offended cultural capitalists from Walter Cronkite to the Incredible Bongo Band. Note that this rarities collection includes the excellent bonus radio-broadcast-turned-CD Nothing to Fear, which came out in 2002 and vanished soon after. Buy it while you can.

Half of these ten tracks are on Out of Hand or Your Place or Mine, both worth owning, only let's face it--you don't. Sounded pretty good for country music, but since he wasn't Hank Williams, you passed. This was dumb. I'm not gonna claim he's Hank, though he's a damn sight closer than Waylon or Hank Jr., because Hank preceded Jerry Lee Lewis, not to mention Eddie Rabbitt, while Gary lives in a world that includes both--no matter what they think at RCA, he's no stranger to concepts like ""rock"" and ""commercial."" Which is not to suggest that boogie or schlock dilutes these vibrato-laden outcries of desperate abandon--they're the pure hard country of a honky-tonk piano man. No matter how justly Jerry Lee suffers, he always seems affronted that this should be happening to him. Though he hasn't thought about going to church two successive Sundays since he was twelve, Gary knows that what the Bible says is true--that sin and hell are the same place. And he lives there.

FALSE,A,Gary's Greatest,Gary Stewart,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1352,"
Because the label has already reissued 1975's Out of Hand, this leans harder on his gradual decline than would seem advisable, and ends up dispelling doubts as a result--he didn't write the 1981 45-only ""She's Got a Drinking Problem"" (""and it's me""), but it belongs to him anyway. Stewart is obsessed with the fucked-up intersections of booze, sex, and the honest life. He's so far outside Nashville's not inelastic limits that he ended up on a blues indie. And strong song for strong song, he's the equal of any postoutlaw you care to name except maybe John Anderson. So what are you waiting for?

The real reason it's OK for Mike Skinner to rap about celebrity instead of blokedom is that his skills have leapt a quantum. His comic timing and mixture of slangs--not to mention his musical conception (chorus-sung choruses, a great way for a bloke to blow his recoupables)--are all so much more fully developed that he's actually made a record that's fun to play in the background. You'll sing along to the hooks, and every time you home in on a couple of lines they'll make you smile--except on the farewell to his dad, which you can bet cogitates harder than the one about international relations.

FALSE,A,File Under: Easy Listening,Sugar,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3371,"
Loud electric guitar metaphors fall into two basic categories: attack and transport. The buzzsaw, the jackhammer, and the machine gun versus the V-8, the midnight special, and the jet airliner. Bob Mould has always been a barrage man, but here he's in takeoff mode--whether embracing girl-group doo-doo-doos and blues readymades or simply lifting heavenward, his exhilaration doesn't show much downside. The blissful ""Your Favorite Thing"" (see below) suggests he's running on love sweet love, suffusing even side two's breakups and putdowns with kindness and good humor. It's that impossible dream, an interesting album about happy romance. Remember power pop, all those benighted Byrdsmaniacs and tintinnabulating Rickenbackers? Now imagine it with brains and muscles.

FALSE,A,On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volume I & II,Donna Summer,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1068,"
The title tells us Summer wants to be a pop queen rather than a dance queen, and the music tells us she's got a right: almost in a class with '60s Motown. I mean, this woman will never compete for Lady Soul, but she enjoys singing as much as Diana Ross ever has, and if her timbre isn't as magical her robust technique makes up for it. Despite the repeat of the title tune (the first time is dandy), the overlap with Bad Girls (another must-own), and the inevitable ""MacArthur Park"" (almost tolerable in this non-suite version), her best-of proves that whatever the virtues of her disco extensions, she makes like a rock and roller at AM size.

You want meaning, I've got a nice Nick Drake CD I could sell you. This here is emotional sensation, the staple of contemporary bigpop. Her belated one-disc best-of does include the permanent excrescence ""MacArthur Park"" as well as a Vangelis hymn that has actually aged rather well. So you can blame the hit parade on her if you want. She'll be proud, and vocally, she'll still love to love you mister--or sister, or kid, whatever, she's utterly ecumenical (although at low points she's been known to poke nervous fun at the gay men who made her a star). When she's not simply stupendous, she simulates passion with a velvety finish.

Call the most affecting political album of our brutally politicized era the lament of the slack motherfucker. Unlike most alt-rockers, Mac McCaughan thinks railing against Trump is a proper use of his aesthetic essence and finds words for his loathing: ""Hate so graceless and so cavalier,"" ""You have a dream / a bloody nightmare / for any human that's not you,"" ""all your bad choices / are gonna cause suffering yeah."" And while claiming the good guys have time on their side, he can't help observing that ""all these old men / won't die too soon,"" which is one reason ""everyone is acting normal / but no one's sleeping through the night."" He's torn apart by the ineffectiveness of his present and the ""shit decisions"" of his past. He calculates that youthful Reagan voters greatly outnumbered Reagan Youth fans who thought they were so smart. ""We were awful bored,"" he recalls; ""too late we find our feet,"" he realizes. So he devotes his wakeful fifties to bitter lyrics that make themselves clear, anthemic tunes that make them inescapable, and broken vocals that make them hurt.

FALSE,A,Diwan 2,Rachid Taha,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15239,"
It's almost cheating--as on the 1998 Diwan, the rai-rocker simply raids an enormous store of popular music for surefire tunes few non-Arabic speakers have heard and fewer noticed. Many have a good beat, too, though not as frantic as Taha prefers. That's why he throws in two Steve Hillage-aided originals, both also aided by Kadi Bouguenaya, whose reed-blown flute sets ""Ah Mon Amour"" wailing. Still, the melodies carry the album--melodies an older Taha is singing with more heart and soul and arranging with fewer Cairo strings. The excellent translations sing love's passion more than they bemoan its pain. But the tunes make the sturm and drang seem worthwhile either way.

FALSE,A,Bonjour,Rachid Taha,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15238,"

On the whole th""Ha Baby"" is actually part-country (as in Nashville country, really), you can half hear what he means. Quality dips ever so slightly tracks six-through-eight, including a celebration of ancient Arab-Jewish amity and a whispered one he IDs as ""how to talk about death while staying alive."" But my only real complaint is that there are no trots--just enticing descriptive phrases alongside mostly Arabic script, though not on the title track, which begins ""Hello Kitty bonjour Violent Femmes."" In a world where too many are set on paradise, I believe this guy is committed to the party of this world, which is also my party, and I want ever detail I can get.

FALSE,A,Zoom,Rachid Taha,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16015,"
This is the sixth solo studio album for the trilingual but mostly Arabic-singing 55-year-old French-Algerian since 1998's breakthrough Diwan. Every one has been first-rate, every one just different enough; even the live entry fills out what I hesitate to call his oeuvre, a word that feels sillier than usual in a scrappy rock lifer who just wants to make a little money here--while subtly addressing major political and cultural issues in the most legible desert crossover yet devised. This time the change-ups come from juju trancemaster Justin Adams, Mick Jones honoring his youth, a chanteuse sweetening ""It's Now or Never,"" and a sample from the Egyptian goddess whose name is rendered not as Um Kulthum but as the old-school, rhymes-with-zoom Oum Kalsoum. Taha's rough attack can't match the rough-attack greats--Springsteen, say, or Fogerty--much less such fluent, gritty-when-necessary rivals to the south as Rochereau and N'Dour. For that reason, his excellent records may feel less essential to the English speaker in the long run. But I'll play this one remembering that my favorite track on sound alone is number three, ""Jamila,"" which attacks forced marriage and bears as title an Arabic name that translates as ""pretty.""

FALSE,A,More Songs About Buildings and Food,Talking Heads,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3400,"
Here the Heads become a quintet in an ideal producer-artist collaboration--Eno contributes/interferes just enough. Not only does his synthesized lyricism provide flow and continuity, it also makes the passive, unpretentious technological mysticism he shares with the band real in the aural world. In fact, there is so much beautiful music (and so much funky music) on this album that I'll take no more complaints about David Byrne's voice. Every one of these eleven songs is a positive pleasure, and on every one the tension between Byrne's compulsive flights and the sinuous rock bottom of the music is the focus. I have more doubts than ever about Byrne's post-hippie work-ethic positivism--on one new song, he uses the phrase ""wasting precious time"" and means it--but if it goes with music this eccentric and compelling I'm damn sure going to hear him out.
"
FALSE,A,Remain in Light,Talking Heads,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3402,"
In which David Byrne conquers his fear of music in a visionary Afrofunk synthesis--clear-eyed, detached, almost mystically optimistic. First side's a long dance-groove more sinuous than any known DOR that climaxes in the middle with the uncontorted ""Crosseyed and Painless"" but begins at the beginning: when Byrne shouts out that ""the world moves on a woman's hips""--not exactly a new idea in rock and roll--it sounds as if he's just discovered the secret of life for himself, which he probably has. Second side celebrates a young terrorist and recalls John Cale in his spookiest pregeopolitical mode but also begins at the beginning: with ""Once in a Lifetime,"" the greatest song Byrne will ever write. It's about the secret of life, which even a woman's hips can't encompass.

FALSE,A,Little Creatures,Talking Heads,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3406,"
As I assume you've figured out, this return to basics isn't exactly Talking Heads '77. What the relatively straight and spare approach signifies is that their expansive '80s humanism doesn't necessarily require pluralistic backup or polyrhythmic underpinnings. It affirms that compassionate grown-ups can rock and roll. The music is rich in hidden treasures the way their punk-era stuff never was, and though the lyrics aren't always crystalline, their mysteries seem more like poetry than obscurantism this time out. Anyway, most of the time their resolute happiness and honest anger are right there, and in ""Stay Up Late"" they come up with a baby song that surpasses ""Willie and the Hand Jive"" itself.

The most attractive thing about this homespun Western-swing masterpiece--infusing both its sure, unassuming intelligence and its plain and lovely songs--is a mildness reminiscent of the first recorded string bands. Talley's careful conception and production both work to revive a playing-pretty-for-our-friends feel that most folkies would give up their rent-controlled apartments for. Despite its intense rootedness, it's neither defensive nor preachy--just lays down a way of life for all to hear.

Digitally spectacular and harmonically futuristic, solo Tatum is also florid and self-involved. But with Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, Benny Carter, Buddy DeFranco, etc. playing one thoughtful note to a handful of his brilliant ones, the aptness, ambition, and jaw-dropping entertainment value of his silvery showers shine through. The young Tatum was so enamored of his own technique that he suffered sidemen begrudgingly, and all these standards were recorded, mostly in quartet or trio formats, over the three years before he died at 47. You'd never guess he'd slowed down by then if the booklet didn't swear it was true.

The six fingers on Taylor's hands abraded his vibrato almost as good as 10-dollar guitars and cracked amps, which is a good thing, because in the end he found his hero Elmore James a bit of a fancy man. Filling out a trio with another guitar and a drum kit, he blasted Maxwell Street with a scrawny sound the booklet swears was ""huge,"" which is another way of saying ""Play Loud."" From the ""It Hurts Me Too"" that howls out crucial lines in a prearticulate slide to the joyously unforgiving ""Give Me Back My Wig,"" this is the house-rockin' music nobody else ever got right, as perfect in its way as Jimmy Reed, or the Ramones.

Where the nominally similar Gorillaz are cool and detached, Teddybears want the world and they want it soon. Early in the lead track Eve--you remember Eve--utters, in fact sings, ""I am the robot Elvis rocking my bionic pelvis/I'm Technotronic sipping vodka tonics yeah I'm selfish/I am the Killer shaking up some more rock and roll,"" at which point a vocodored Patrick Arve, Joachim Ahlund, or (most likely) Klas Ahlund murmurs, ""Them drum machines ain't got no soul."" Joke or gauntlet? The cheap answer is both, but let's make it gauntlet. Not afraid to be funny because they're having so much fun, Arve-Ahlund-Ahlund are one more electrobeat-wielding Swedish cartel bent on proving that rock and roll proceeds from enlightened capitalism like we had in America before our plutocrats started expanding the national income gap up past Colombia's. As soon as Eve is through, here come B.o.B. exulting about how he's gon' ""Get Mama a House,"" Wayne Coyne having a go at ""Crystal Meth Christians,"" Cee-Lo and the B-52's praising a pussycat who happens to be named ""Cho Cha."" There's also some unusually cheerful Krautrock and the antidrug ""Cardiac Arrest,"" featuring the Teddybears' close personal business associate Robyn, who's why they got to make another U.S. album. Last one was Soft Machine, 2006. Sounded good then. Now it sounds like rock and roll busy being reborn.

FALSE,A,Everybody Down,Kate Tempest,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16301,"
In which a young Ted Hughes Award poet fashions a concept album with a fully coherent narrative that engages solely as music when you don't feel like following its well-mapped twists. Starring a coke dealer who wants out, his underemployed younger brother, and the waitress turned masseuse both have a yen for, the plot sketches an alienated love triangle hooked on a heist with a hole in it. London electronipop luminary Dan Carey enhances Tempest's accent, which is firmly antiposh without the slightest Cockney affectation, and flow, which is unfailingly distinct without a hint of elocution lessons. The story gives London's boho-pop demimonde family ties, and the songs are so specific about alienated love in that demimonde that you could imagine Tempest making a novel out of it. That novel is due out later this year.

The Tempts were too good for their own good--good enough to placate what was once called the adult audience with so-called ""standards."" Fortunately, the horrible examples that blotch their catalogue are held to ""The Impossible Dream,"" which closes disc one with a dull, symbolic thud. Whereupon they start fronting Norman Whitfield's funk group, which was one of the best. Personally, I would have skipped a few Motown subclassics for a little of the crazy and mellifluous late doowop they made back when Paul Williams was their soul man and Berry Gordy hadn't finalized his formula. But as any American should know, ""My Girl"" and ""It's Growing"" and ""My Girl"" and ""I Wish It Would Rain"" and ""My Girl"" and ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"" and ""My Girl"" are the essence of that formula--and also, if he was as lucky as we hope, of David Ruffin's tragic life.

I recently asked two young musos who Joe Tex was. The Irish guy didn't have a clue, but the African American did--""Bang a Gong,"" right? Sheesh. Before and after he became a Black Muslim minister, this East Texas moralist-jokester mixed such timeless trifles as ""Skinny Legs and All"" (God, don't you even remember that one?) and ""Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)"" (a lucky last gasp occasioning a luckier album that came out for ""sissies"") with a good-humored country wisdom that rivaled Smokey's urban variant for pith and empathy. Nashville pro Buddy Killen oversaw the Muscle Shoals funk, but the music's economy and amiability grew out of Tex's character and talent. So ""Hold What You've Got,"" people. Remember that ""The Love You Save (May Be Your Own)."" And don't neglect the p.i. benchmark in which a Vietnam-era GI Joe hears from his sweetheart: ""And your letter brought me so much strength/(Tell you what I did, baby, huh, you won't believe it)/I raised up and got me two more enemies.""

Their secret is that as unmediated pop postmodernists they can be themselves stealing from anywhere, modulating without strain or personal commitment from hick to nut to nerd. Like the cross-eyed bear in the regretful but not altogether kind ""Hide Away Folk Family,"" their ""shoes are laced with irony,"" but that doesn't doom them to art-school cleverness or never meaning what they say. Their great subject is the information overload that lends these songs their form. They live in a world where ""Everything Right Is Wrong Again"" and ""Youth Culture Killed My Dog.""

Guys who feed songs to their pet answering machine are supposed to write more than anyone can keep track of. The Eurohit is here, the TV theme, the Austin Powers-certified Shirley Bassey parody. But I'm won over by the dozens of songs I'd never heard before, or just never noticed. Yeah their unsexxxy voices and avoidance of notes that might confuse an answering machine can be off-putting. But the wit and tunes are nonstop, not to mention the historical sketches, the music lessons, the surrealist riddles, the love songs--and more faith, hope, and charity than they let on.

FALSE,A,The Leon Thomas Album,Leon Thomas,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10960,"
I've got to admit it: If anything like a Great Artist--a concept I by no means entirely approve--has arisen in popular music since the first great days of rock, Leon Thomas is probably it. He has literally expanded the musical possibilities of the human voice. He is as powerful a jazz/blues singer as Joe Williams or Joe Turner, both of whom he occasionally resembles, as inventive a scatter as Ella Fitzgerald. But that's just the beginning, for despite the generation lag, Thomas beats Turner and Williams in their mode even while singing his own, and he turns scatting from a virtuoso trick into an atavistic call from the unconscious. So even though I think Oliver Nelson's arrangements here don't suit the material; even though I'm slightly embarrassed by the inflation of a Thomas composition like ""I Am""; even though I'm not sure all of Thomas's explorations in black consciousness are apropos; despite all this, I have to suspend my disbelief and recommend this record unreservedly to anyone with the slightest fondness for jazz.

And not only does he know about love gone wrong--""I'll Regret It All in the Morning"" is as bleak as relationship songs get--he also knows about ice cream.

News of the wife's solitary return to England brings this relationship-in-crisis album home--including the husband's ""bearded lady"" warning in ""The Wall of Death,"" ostensibly a synthesis of his thanatotic urge and lowlife tic. If poor Richard's merely ""A Man in Need,"" I'm an ayatollah, but I have to give him credit--these are powerfully double-edged metaphors for the marriage struggle, and ""Did She Jump or Was She Pushed?"" is as damning an answer song as Linda could wish.

One young U.K. rave cites ""The Stooges, The Ramones, Stereolab, Suicide and The Fall""; a middle-aged friend eavesdrops from the kitchen and asks who that is that sounds like the Beatles. In short, this EP evokes everyone and no one, except maybe pop fans who get just plain excited making songs out of Moogy drones and distaff football choruses and bang-crash drums and fab guitars and everything else they like. Not just ebullient, which is rare enough, but ebulliently anything-goes, without any neoprimitivist/neominimalist guardrails keeping them out of the abyss. Plus the kind of obscurely goofy lyrics that are so irritating in ordinary theoretical pop. Goofy--I love it. B-52's?

And for almost every sound they provide a sharp song, which is more than Holland-Dozier-Holland and Gamble-Huff could manage when they were compelled to stick to one. Defeating second-half trail-off and a CD-age windiness the band isn't beatwise enough to beat, Saadiq's flexible, sensitive, slightly nasal tenor, spelled by the grain of D'Wayne Wiggins's workaday baritone, recasts the tradition in its image.

Hardcore punk and hardcore ska join mook metal, hip hop criminal-mindedness, and the occasional rap element to form a music whose intense focus is absolutely punk and just about unprecedented. Rancid guitarist Tim Armstrong and Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker are the masterminds, previously unrecorded hanger-on Rob Aston the singer who added lyrics and meaning. Aston sounds like the young Shane MacGowan and writes as both a drug-dealing scumbag and a street person on a mission. He could be either, or both.

Which is fine for aesthetes--me, I listen to country music for singers and songs, in this case songs. Writing for money, Travis was a man of his class in the homeless ""No Vacancy,"" the now-traditional ""Dark as a Dungeon,"" From Here to Eternity's ""Re-Enlistment Blues,"" and, oh yeah, ""Sixteen Tons."" He was a man of his gender in the endlessly clever ""So Round, So Firm, So Fully Packed,"" ""I Like My Chicken Fryin' Size,"" and on and on. And he was a font of Inspirational Verse. Try ""Cincinnati Lou"" (""She's got a way of rollin' them eyes/Makes me think of paradise/And I don't mean heaven just a plain old pair o' dice"") or ""Fat Gal"" (""Warm in the winter, shady in the summertime,"" and also ""If things get rough and times get hard/I'll render my gal and sell the lard"") or ""Lawdy, What a Gal"" (""You keep your eyes wide open/Every time I'm kissin' you/The reason that I know you do/Is I keep them open too"").

The consumer fraud does his rep an injustice: put all 22 tracks from his two separately sold best-ofs on one CD, where they belong, and there'd be no doubting who's the preeminent country singer of our era. As laid-back as Lefty or Merle with more voice than either, he reaches down to muse in a bass every bit as conversational as the high baritone he beseeches with, and his hits never force an emotion or waste a word. He's a homebody rather than a honky tonker, and he flirts with genre exercise--Lefty didn't need to explain, ""I come from the country,"" or peddle an antialienation homily like ""Heroes and Friends."" Nevertheless, his style is so consistent that the jumbled chronology will be inaudible to listeners who didn't date their lives by these songs. Not only will it convince you that the genre is his life, but that it has something to do with yours.

""They provided the soundtrack for your life,"" annotator Selwyn Seyfu Hinds reminds the collegiate hip hoppers for whom Quest was the great crew of the '90s, politely failing to mention that for just that reason they don't need this record except to reconceive a catalogue they know by heart. But then there's the rest of us, for whom they've always been background music two ways--as the atmospheric stuff so many hip hoppers make of jazz and as the soundtrack to someone else's life. For us, these nonstop highlights are a godsend. Quest's swinging conversation unifies a sequence subtler and more musical than strict chronology would allow--the way two horny debut cuts poke in toward the end, say. Having added jazz bass to funky drum programmers to quiet flow to hooks-to-go to matter-of-fact realism-not-""reality,"" they convince our viscera what our brains allowed--that Quest was a great band. So if they want Roy Ayers, they can have him too.

I have no idea whether this will prove the smash Maxinquaye wasn't--well, actually I do, but I promise to keep it quiet if you do. For sure he's presented his new label with his first song album since then. Where once were textures you could write a poem about now are textures you can hang a tune on. And forget P.J. Harvey for clout, this one's got the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Alanis Morissette and, uh, Live and Cyndi Lauper--all of whom sound fabulous. Yes, he's still very down in the mouth. With him, that's a matter of principle. But his defiance is more coherent, his mysticism more visionary. And if it's not gauche of me to mention it, he rocks and does a Nirvana song, not necessarily at the same time.

At a moment when conscious rap has never had more reason to be militant, Chance the Rapper, his man with a horn, and friends near and far count their blessings, to borrow an idiom one Saba invokes immediately before his uncle on house arrest dies in his sleep. Not by chance does Chance lead with one called ""Miracle,"" because the title ain't no joke--the mood does in fact recall the Beach Boys of, say, six months before Pet Sounds and 60 years before Cali turned firetrap. Like Broken Social Scene with more swing and deeper soul, most of these young adults are making decent livings making good music, quite a few are better off than that, and all of them are so glad about it they infuse even their warnings about open windows and Migos videos with an airy lyricism that evokes Digable Planets, PM Dawn, and Jon Hassell himself. This is an album where Big Sean and B.o.B. reflect separately and ruefully on their high school careers, where Erykah Badu plays den mother and sage, where Bustah Rhymes figures ""This whole planet belongs to me/We all feel the same so it belongs to we,"" where I haven't even mentioned the should-be hit.

Throughout, guitarist-etc. Seth Lorinczi provides the right shades of darkness--sometimes enticing, sometimes engulfing--as Sleater-Kinney fans long for a bright and cleansing breakout. They get one as ""Handed Love"" goes out, when Corin shouts her desperation and rips off a riff, then tops the outburst with the even more rousing ""Doubt."" That's where first-timers will enter the record. Only later will they ask themselves just how rousing doubt can or should be--or so I hope, as does Tucker.

In a lo-fi universe overloaded with youneek sonic experiments of no consequence to anyone but a small circle of ""friends,"" ex-puppeteer, ex-nanny Merrill Garbus ventures into the great big world and creates a private one built for sharing. Deploying a dictaphone and some sampling shareware, she extracts beats and/or effects from found sounds I know to include kitchen implements, children's voices, and the Martha's Vineyard ferry. She also learns to use a beatbox, plays mucho ukulele, and sings like a folk musicians' daughter who digs show tunes and madrigal, which is what she is. My breakthrough track was a Mbuti pygmy rip that respected the depth of its sources rather than cuting them up, but soon enough very different tracks slipped in alongside. There was a bonus, too. DIY though she may be, Garbus writes a fair number of love or relationship songs. And she's too kind, proud, and down-to-earth to pretend they're anything else.

Leaping and flowing, growling and crooning, exclaiming and explaining, stopping short for horns and glitches you had no idea were coming, Merrill Garbus's second album has the tune power and groove appeal normal music lovers put on repeat. And if too many normal music lovers think it's abnormal, at least she's hired a bassist, not to mention a studio into which at least a dozen other living musicians are suspected to have ventured. I don't suppose it'll help much to venture that Garbus contains in one person the finest attributes of Captain Beefheart and Phoebe Snow, not with the former a demigod and the latter a footnote. But she does reconstitute roots tonalities and procedures without hermeticism or egomania, and she does roll around in her enormous voice without bathos or undue expressionism. And though you won't wonder about the lyrics until you've had your fill of the music, she tells you what she has to say in the opening ""My Country"" and explores its ramifications for 10 songs and 42 minutes. ""When they have nothing why do you have something?"" she asks, with the ""you"" encompassing both herself and her country. ""The worst thing about living a lie is just wondering when they'll find out,"" she warns, with the ""they"" encompassing have-nothings everywhere. That is, she deploys her superb music to address an issue so pressing few can stand to think about it: who kills who?

Atlantic was the site of Turner's ""dumbing down,"" saith Jim ""James"" Miller, by which he means it's where the noble shouter streamlined, speeded up, and otherwise refused to act his age. The sound on this strictly hit-bound single-disc is one Turner devised himself in self-produced New Orleans sessions featuring a band-not-combo whose single-minded unison will pass for first r&amp;b and then rock and roll. It's perfected with ""Shake, Rattle and Roll,"" cut in New York with Atlantic sharpsters including drummer Connie Kay, whose sock means even more to the song than the sun shining through Jesse Stone's lyric. Until the niche marketers catch up with him, this fat (fat) 43-year-old is set to flip, flop, and fly all over America's teenaged heart.

Having been sucked struggling into the slough of despond that is Return to Cookie Mountain only to swim out a wholer, if muddier, man, I first took exception to the graceless lyrics they croon and groan on top of their catchy new funk. Transmutation of the negative--seemed too easy, a time-worn rock trick. But listen to the music as much as you'll want to and slowly the verbal opacities dissipate. You'll notice zingers like ""Keep your dancing shoes off mine,"" ""scared to death that I'm livin' a life not worth dying for."" And eventually, if you pay attention, you'll hear an album that makes sense of the public lives of club-scene warrior-laborers who have kept it real and turned into affluent young professionals anyway. The thing about the indie-rock life is that even its depressives, not just mere realists like these guys, have a pretty good time. That's the point, right? So they retain their realism while celebrating the bright side. On the glorious ""Red Dress,"" they also make clear that they haven't transcended their racial identity, no matter how much indie-rock wants to think so. Transcending race just isn't something that happens in America--at least not yet.

I always figured great Blood would sound like the climactic ""Swing and Things""--pure virtuosic rave-up, Mahavishnu with soul and ideas. But of course, great Blood ended up sounding like nothing I could have predicted. With a new band comprising drummer Warren Benbow and violinist Charles Burnham--that's right, funk fans, no bass, though with Ulmer's strong fingers you can't always tell--he's created an ur-American synthesis that takes in jazz, rock, Delta blues (suddenly his mush-mouthed vocals kick home, especially on the heart-torn ""Please Tell Her""), and even country music (though Burnham's fiddle also has a Middle Eastern effect). I don't mean he goes from one to the other, either--most of the time, you'd be hard-pressed to pin just one style on any of this painfully beautiful stuff. Great Blood, that's all.

In a year when someone named Binki Shapiro ain't Kimya Dawson, someone named Aesop Rock will wash Adam Green right out of your head. Protesting the decline of the laundromat and promoting the rise of organ donation, ecumenicizing ""Superheroes"" with ""Fluffernutter/Shawarma/Reuben/Cuban"" and eulogizing the friend of a friend who justified Dawson's fear of flying, it's the return of the deeply goofy male-female duet. The tunes are Dawson's because Ae-Rock doesn't do tunes, but his beats beef up those tunes just like his gruff, clotted flow beefs up her itty-bitty soprano. Most important, her poetic confessionals function as glosses on his rhymes, which are a touch more straightforward in any case. True, they bog down into his big think for a spell. But all is redeemed by a spirited finale designed to jar the downhearted from facing life, as they put it, tits up.

Whatever the extent of their world travels geographical and virtual on this album, the actual money remains with people they only know, particularly the putative ex-girlfriend to whom Ezra Koenig addresses half his new songs. One exception is the guy who inspired ""Giving Up the Gun""--still plays guitar down at that ex-skinhead bar, but his ears are shot to hell and he feels obsolete. Vampire Weekend give him respect, but ""Contra"" establishes that his band has chosen another path, celebrating the world's contradictions, contraindications, and contradistinctions with a new pop sound made up of old pop sounds that aren't the same old pop sounds. As for that controversy you may have read about, they spell too well to care.

This was hard to suss out at the time, which is probably why people are still learning from it. It sounds intermittently crude, thin, and pretentious at first, but it never stops getting better; even ""Venus in Furs,"" Lou Reed's first recorded sadie-maisie exploitation, is held in place by the narcotic drone that identifies and unifies the LP musically. Nico's contained chantoozy sexuality works against the dispassionate abandon of Reed's chant singing for a vocal variety the band will never duplicate, although their ever-increasing mastery of electric noise and throwaway wordplay, will more than make up for it. How about that--they're gonna be famous more than 15 minutes.

The Velvets are to Manhattan what the Rascals are to New York--that is, they really make ""Rock &amp; Roll"" (a title), but they're also really intellectual and ironic. Lou Reed's singing embodies the paradox even on beat-goes-on throwaways about cowboys and trains.

Each of the Velvets' four official studio albums had a distinct personality, and so does this unofficial one, recorded mostly in mid-1969, right after The Velvet Underground appeared. It's goofy, relaxed, simultaneously conversational and obscure, an effect accentuated by the unfinished feel of takes the band never prepared for public consumption. As a result, especially given PolyGram's state-of-the-art remix, it's their most listenable record even if its friendliness is deceptive--the disarming straight-ahead rocker ""Foggy Notion"" has a lyric whose casual sadism beats any of The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico's shock-horror perversities. If you ever doubt the VU's rightness, just compare the flashy compromises of the solo ""Lisa Says"" and ""I Can't Stand It"" (itself the making of Lou Reed) to the flat rush of the Tucker/Morrison-powered versions here. A Basement Tapes for the '80s.

This has been raving without letup ever since it arrived at my house as an import in September of '77. Mixing raw vocals and relentless tempos with hooks that should strike familiar chords among over-twenties, it's a way into the punk style for seekers after pure musical rush. Those who listen to lyrics may regret, as I do, that they care so much about sex, since despite the distancing and pacing their s&amp;m interests are clearly more than a flirtation with the absolute--they're narsty. Then again, so were the Velvets'. And this remains good new-fashioned rock and roll at its wildest.

Sticking to 1956 tracks featuring the wild and quick guitarist Cliff Gallup and the propulsivey light-handed 15-year-old drummer Dickie Harrell, 20 songs in 47 minutes add not so much flesh as spirit to the tales told of lesser rockabilly legends--Carl Perkins, Eddie Cochran, Johnny Burnette, Charlie Feathers, Rick Nelson and his studio pal Charlie Burton, every one of whom this gimpy weirdo outruns to the poontang. The compositions may not be much, but that's what they said about Bo Diddley.

Wainwright has aged no better than most likable bad boys, maybe worse. His promising-to-excellent young songs turned gamy in the '80s--how many rueful immaturity jokes can one over-30 sing?--and though some claim he grew up with History, its Iron John sensitivity was a cover for the same old self-involvement. But by sampling the highs of his over-30 output while eliding its numerous flubs, this constitutes a summing up. Framed by two unembittered accounts of how he makes his living and dotted with illustrative patter, it has its heart-tuggers (""Your Mother and I,"" written to explain the inevitable breakup to his and Suzzy Roche's daughter), but mostly it presents him as what he is--a talented wag who came in his cummerbund, dropped clown acid, and never became a star. It should cheer any over-30 bad boy who can forget that his spotty sex life and pathetic adventures in substance abuse will never be as entertaining as this born entertainer's. It may also convince the bad boy's squeeze that things could be worse.

Young folkies are attracted to their chosen past because it seems so raw. But though young folkie Wainwright twigged to this totemic mountaineer via the line ""The beefsteak it was rare and the butter had red hair,"" now he's old enough to cook him. Poole didn't write that line or anything else he sang--he'd perform Paul Dresser's musty ""The Letter That Never Came"" as soon as W.C. Handy's hightailing ""Ramblin' Blues"" if he thought it was good for a drink. And in Wainwright's plentifully illustrated and annotated two-CD tribute, where nine of the 29 selections are new songs by Wainwright and/or producer Dick Connette, Poole stands as a touchstone of a bygone era. Wainwright is such a card that you don't think of him as a singer, but he puts more throat and thorax into the sentimental ballads than Poole had in him, and his barn burners are louder and faster without approaching Poole's rooted assurance or reckless abandon. These conscious misprisions are fine by me. In fact, I'm more likely to play the canny reconstruction than the certified original. I'm older than Poole ever was.

A reluctant 50, he started playing the Old card with the adulthood album Grown Man; now, a saggy stripling of 65, he trumps himself with a mortality album. Wainwright has been writing death songs for years, of course, but on his eighth album and label of the young century the theme turns concept. In one song he's a ghost; another features a reflection his late father wrote about his own late father; the one that begins ""Somebody else I knew just died"" is followed by the one called ""The Days That We Die."" Family members abound, including the late Kate McGarrigle in a remake of her sole co-write with her husband, from before either was 30, which happens to be called ""Over the Hill."" There are cameos from Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Chris Smither, John Scofield, the winsome Dame Edna Everage; Tom Lehrer declined but loved how Wainwright fit the word ""Mercurochrome"" into ""My Meds."" With Elliott, Loud-O bids for a do-over: ""You don't know what you're doin' and you can't just wait;/You go ahead and do it and then it's too late/You need a double lifetime."" After he goes down on his knees and prays, as he promises he will, this album will be Exhibit A on his application.

Having creamed for these 56 songs old, new and nobody's talking, I returned with trepidation. Sure enough, the first time through, too many had faded on me. Soon, however, even ones I'd given up on were bum-rushing my earhole, like ""Lucinda,"" with its steel-driving beat and gallows gloom. One reason, close attention to 1988's ""Sea of Love"" suggests, is that his groan has grown more distinct. And though it would be mere rhetoric to claim the six spoken-word pieces on Disc 3 are really music--they're yarns, jokes, theater, that's the point--they do really sound good. I said sound.

Warwick had a voice that you admire like many or love like me--pop velvet with a gospel nap, the epitome of walk-on-by reserve except when amped by commitment to craft, romantic disputation, existential indignation, or her hurting heart. In the first great heyday of rock guitar, her feel for Brill Building baion enabled another kind of beat music: traditional pop with a Latin difference. Her breakup with her two mentors crippled all three for life.

Warwick aged terribly--rid of Burt Bacharach, she immediately immersed in the ritual emotion of divahood. But as his ingenue she was a model of self-possessed vulnerability. Though this chart-determined 16-song budget CD skips such lovely moments as ""You'll Never Get to Heaven"" and ""I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,"" it still leaves her on the right side of 30, which for the purposes of this argument means 29. Dry with a sweetness like affordable champagne, she was girl-group's big sister, her natural sense of style based on close readings of Harper's Bazaar and sage advice from her Uncle Burt-who was in the business, who lost his touch when she wasn't there to dress anymore, and who didn't regain it when she came back her own woman.

Waters' greatest hits are so deeply ingrained that these obscurities serve to reawaken your awe--force you to hear his performance, which as countless white bluesmen know is what makes all his music jump out atcha. ""Feel Like Going Home,"" a blues after the manner of Robert Johnson that augments the timing and sonic authority of Waters' guitar and vocalisms with a crucial decade of recording technology, is the sparest and most riveting. But ""Mean Disposition"" and ""Iodine In My Coffee"" would be greatest hits today if they'd come out circa 1950, and generics like ""Born Lover"" and ""Little Anna Mae"" make me wonder when he cut his ordinary stuff.

Psychologically, the tell is: ""You were so condescending / You wrote me in, gave me a part / See, I always gravitate toward / Those who are unimpressed."" Not anymore--with no romantic entanglements to sing of, she's more than content with family, friends, and an all-female band so impressed they love her to pieces. And since she's chosen this moment of emotional clarity to deploy not only verbal clarity but the syntax it deserves, I'm all in. Any guy who'd condescend to this forthright young woman has got serious problems. Too many guys do.

Granting Maybelle Carter her own category as traditionalist matriarch, Wells was country's first queen, and though she broke through on the side of the honky tonk angels, her real theme song was ""I'd Rather Stay Home""--for her, the wild side of life was a last resort. Once in a while--on ""Searching (For Someone Like You),"" to be precise--her unadorned longsuffering gets wearisome, but Nashville was a better place after this plainest and most self-effacing of singers started voicing sentiments like ""Will Your Lawyer Talk to God,"" ""Mommy for a Day,"" and ""I Gave My Wedding Dress Away.""

The first six tracks here are the same six tracks in the same order that Massa Gordy put on his little runaway's Greatest Hits in 1964. From the calm, hurt ""The One Who Really Loves You"" to the blissful, confident ""My Guy,"" they're Smokey Robinson's portrait of the heroine as a nice girl: a vision of female sensitivity balanced by female pride, all plain poetry and subdued sexual promise. The Shirelles themselves never said it better. Only then, starting with a Marvin Gaye duet and proceeding on the simple strength of compiler Harry Weinger's taste, the less canonical numbers sustain the illusion that Greatest Hits turns to filler. There's even a song written by the artist, who proved what a fool she was to desert Motown--and what a construction her modesty was--with every piece of forced soul and adult pop she turned out for Fox, MGM, Atlantic, etc. This is all the distinction Wells had in her. It was epochal, and it was over before she passed 21.

Wemba is probably the most famous and certainly the most flamboyant of the many graduates of Zaiko Langa Langa, the band that turned rumba into soukous with hard guitar and traditional rhythms and structures in the early '70s. His high, harsh voice cuts like it's serrated, and the harmonies are almost acrid sometimes, just like Nguando Milos's lead guitar lines, which break away from the merely engaging competition both sonically and melodically. An admirer of the old discursive song forms, Wemba milks soukous's bipartite conventions for something very much like drama--more than once I've assumed a piece was ending only to have it break into a perfectly inevitable aftermath. Inspirational liner note: ""La ville et le village: deux visages que j'aime!""

I know just two tracks of 18, both from import albums; most of the first disc began its life as seven-inch vinyl. But beyond Franco, who bought vocalists in bulk, no one in soukous amassed a catalog of this strength in the '80s, much less the '90s. The audio is shrill at first, and the lead track's guitar is as crude as it got in Zaire--but also, how rock and roll, as exciting. Always conscious of country and city, Wemba has been the rare African to hold his own with synthesizers, yet homes in on two village chants.  He deploys manly shout, girlish falsetto, gritty tenor, and mellow midrange to describe, explain, celebrate, ululate, sigh, cajole, declare his love, and state the facts. And ever since Zaiko Langa Langa, he's led one hell of a band or another.

What is the fuss about his contradictions? The main difference between him and most hip hop journalists is his money. They'd buy the Benz--so would I, Volvos don't last as long--and probably the gold too. They'd say anything to get laid. They accept the economic rationale of dealing and dig music of dubious moral value. Yet at the same time they do their bit for racial righteousness and know full well how much they need the ""single black female addicted to retail."" On Easter Sunday, some of them even believe in Jesus Christ. But none of them are as clever or as funny as Kanye West, and these days I'm not so sure about Eminem either. West came up as a beatmaster, but his Alicia Keys and Talib Kweli hits are pretty bland, and neither his voice nor his flow could lead anyone into sin. So he'd better conceptualize, and he does. Not only does he create a unique role model, that role model is dangerous--his arguments against education are as market-targeted as other rappers' arguments for thug life. Don't do what he says, kids, and don't do what he does, because you can't. Just stay in school. Really. I mean it.

Arrogance per se has never been Yeezy's problem--he has every right to think he's more talented than Nas, Taylor Swift, or me. His problem is that he has no gift for it. Not only is he radically insecure, he didn't come up on the get-it-while-you-can fatalism that armors gangstas street, showbiz, and in between. Cannily and candidly, he acknowledges this on ""Monster,"" where he knows perfectly well that his ""profit profit"" bling-and-sex brag is about to get blown away by padrone Jay-Z's ""All I see is these n****z I made millionaires/Millin' about"" and pink-haired Nicki Minaj's ""bitch from Sri Lanka""-""Willy Wonka""-""watch the queen conquer"" trifecta. Cataloguing the perks of power he sounds as geeky as Mark Zuckerberg, and because grandiosity doesn't suit him deep down, the sonic luxuries of this world-beating return to form have no shot at the grace of The Collede Dropout or Late Registration. But because he's shrewd and large, he knows how to use his profits profits to induce Jay-Z, Pusha T, the RZA, Swizz Beats, and his boy Prince CyHi to admit and indeed complain that the whole deal is ""f***in' ridiculous."" ""Power"" doesn't establish his potency and ""Gorgeous"" isn't quite. But ""Hell of a Life""? ""I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most""? That's his heart, his message, the reason he's so major. It's also why he goes out on a righteous, wacked-out 90-second diatribe by a Gil Scott-Heron so young he hasn't gotten into cocaine--hasn't even signed to a major label.

The third commandment of my school of Orthodox Rock Criticism, after ""Fuck getting there first"" and ""Never read the comments,"" is ""Thou shalt not watch the video."" We Orthodox stick to music music music. So having concluded after a few streams that these 15 one-minute songs belonged in my permanent collection as songs, I'm reviewing the music here--a burn of the Philadelphia rapper-singsonger's EP, which I DLed from Amazon after determining that it wasn't on Bandcamp. The fragments gain emotional weight as they accrue, so that the second half is more affecting than the jokes, brags, reveries, and interpersonal touches that draw you in, with the turning point the hooky hillbilly stomp ""Fuck Off."" But the most emotional moment of all is the 15 seconds of wordless, keyboard-brushed cymbal ticks that transition out of Whack's final line: ""I know that I am worth mo-o-o-ore."" Having figured all this out, however, I decided that professional ethics required me to check the video everybody was raving about on my desktop. And how about that--for once everybody was right. Soon I had it up on the flat-screen for my wife, who'd only liked the EP. The video she loved. ""It gave me reason for living,"" she told me, and we all need those these days.

I'm down with the story that rather than brother and sister they're a divorced couple like Quasi. It suggests that Jack White got the blues someplace else besides the blues and grounds his deprived love songs, which are more grounded than Quasi's anyway. This third album is where he takes both love songs and the blues down the road a piece. ""The Union Forever"" is about marrying for life and also about serving the poor, ""Little Room"" is about making sex last and also about making indie-rock last, and neither is any richer than ""Hotel Yorba,"" which is about plighting your troth with the one you love most. ""If I could hear your pretty voice I don't think I'd need to sing at all,"" he sings. But all she'll promise is to play the drums.

With its acoustic guitars and drumless bits, this triumph of hard rock is no more a pure hard rock album than Tommy. It's got more juice than Live at Leeds. And--are you listening, John Fogerty?--it uses the synthesizer to vary the power trio format, not to art things up. Given Peter Townshend's sharpness and compassion, even his out-front political disengagement--""I don't need to fight""--seems positive. The real theme, I think, is ""getting in tune to the straight and narrow,"" and comes naturally to someone who's devoted a whole LP to the strictures of hit radio. Another sign of growth: the love songs.

You've probably heard the New Orleans nonsense patois before, and maybe the irresistible melodic elements, too, although I can't tell any more, because I've played this ""repetitive"" record so many times it sounds like where they all started (which it may be). For a while, I believed side two inferior, but eventually a longing for ""Big Chief Got a Golden Crown"" set in and now I prefer it for listening. Side one is the best non- (or anti-) disco dance music in years--it had folks who'd never heard it before shouting ""Indians here they come"" at a thirtieth birthday party.

Musically as well as lyrically, Williams was so simple he was profound--Irving Berlin was Brecht-Weill by comparison. Without benefit of drums, his pulse was livelier than that of any competing country singer even when he was very sad, which whatever the tempo was most of the time. But he was also mawkish and austere, and his best-known titles have been played to death. So truth to tell, I generally pull out Lefty Frizzell when I want me some honky-tonk. Now maybe I won't. Although this triple has room for more than the 60 titles it gives up, and the 10 CDs of his box set include major performances it passes by, its size feels just right. First it breaks up the classics with beguiling semi-obscurities. Then it breaks up the semi-obscurities with classics.

On two songs as lived in as their titles, ""Lines Around Your Eyes"" and ""Something About What Happens When We Talk,"" a star-crossed poet of the everyday grows into middle-aged love. The fetishized tire iron and casserole of ""Hot Blood"" romanticize attraction and commitment with a lit major's passion. And then there's death. The most powerful track on this Springsteen-meticulous work of songcraft is the raw, bare, strophic threnody ""Pineola,"" where the truest poetic stroke is the bereftly banal ""And they went to call someone."" So, do the boys who inspired ""He Never Got Enough Love"" and ""Little Angel, Little Brother"" actually die, by which I mean fictionally die? Maybe not, but it sounds like they do.

The young are right to think she's old--having finally broken through at 45, she's now 54. She affects authenticity as shamelessly as her role model, Bob Dylan. But with respect to all the other noble old pros deploying blues and country readymades, the craftiness of Williams' vocals, meaning their unnaturalness, secures their vitality. She doesn't fake spontaneity--she honors it as one of the constellation of life virtues she hopes her songs evoke and subsume. Protruding from this metaphysical quest, her palpable concern for her ex-lover and warm affection for her mom are strengthened rather than compromised, and when she disses her dead mom's funeral, the bile seems organic by contrast. Certainly not what I would call soul. But it knows things about soul that the soulful may not.

Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf cast themselves as forces of nature--fecund, feral. They were younger men, and for them blues already had an aura of myth. In his personal life, the former Rice Miller was harder to control than either. But when it came to business, the least famed of Chess's three W's did what had to be done, which turned out to mean electrifying in the '30s and impersonating Sonny Boy I, a harmonica hero half as talented and 15 years his junior. Miller's writing was as factual as a police complaint, his groove as sexy as a swamp in June, and he sang in the strong, slurred, subtle voice of someone who'd been talking his way out of shit since he learned to say maybe. Songs like ""Eyesight to the Blind"" and ""Nine Below Zero"" and ""Fattening Frogs for Snakes"" are in the canon. Songs like ""Too Young To Die"" and ""Santa Claus"" should be.

Newcomers may be put off by Wills's opportunistic omnivorousness. As a popularizer of what he considered Texas fiddle music, he felt no more loyal to country, which didn't mean much in the '30s anyway, than the early black songsters did to blues. An entertainer who assumed, correctly, that his audience liked everything he did--folk, hillbilly, blues, swing, and let us not forget pop--his format was the pop format of the time, the big band. Plus fiddle and pedal steel, and also plus fellow frontman Tommy Duncan, a congenial equivalent to the generic boy singers of swing. He's almost sublimely relaxed--the country meeting the city without the usual anxious excitement. The classic Wills is just plain Anthology, a Columbia double-LP turned Sony Special Products CD, which collects 24 cuts where the two separately available CDs in this package each offer 16. But these are a tad longer on sheer song quality. Volume 1 duplicates five Sony tracks, Volume 2--which finally convinces me that Wills's post-Columbia work wasn't busy and tuckered out--zero. Wills's eclecticism was tremendously ambitious, but it was never pretentious. And sometimes unpretentiousness is its own reward.

I know Wilson loved Al Jolson and Mario Lanza. I accept it. In a way I even applaud it--why shouldn't he have aspired to the universality of schlock? But on these 16 cuts, including only three from Epic's Jackie Wilson Story plus an earlier, altogether more subdued and thrilling ""Danny Boy,"" you'd almost think he'd stuck with Berry Gordy, and is it a relief. The stiff choruses and big-band climaxes are still in evidence, but on these mostly uptempo album tracks they rarely intrude; occasionally you even notice some guitar. And since Wilson isn't really an interpreter---I said Jolson and Lanza, not Sinatra and Melchior--it's just as well that the songs are raveups and filler, leaving plenty of room for acrobatic workout. ""Shake, Shake, Shake,"" ""Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,"" ""It's So Fine,"" ""Do Lord.""

I don't begrudge Wilson his three-CD box. Excess is the essence of the man; no point liking him if you can't abide a bit of schlock. What's that you say? Can't hear you with the band blaring. All right, a lot of schlock. Musically, the most transitional of the early masters was the creature of Dick Jacobs, whose orchestral overkill make the guys who buried Bobby Bland and Joe Turner in brass sound like acolytes of Louis Jordan. From ""Lonely Teardrops"" to ""Baby Workout,"" Jacobs's rockers are suitably--i.e., supernaturally--sharp. But he felt more at home beefing up Saint-Saens, Tchaikovsky, and Pagliacci, and Mr. Excitement felt honored by the company. Raw and wild though Wilson could be, his spectacular chops sold him on a nightclub circuit that catered to big-band fans. So if you actually can't abide a lot of schlock, stick to this rocking condensation and learn why ""Danny Boy"" is a folk song.

The simultaneous rawness and detachment of this debut LP returns rock and roll irony to the (native) land of Mick Jagger, where it belongs. From a formal strategy almost identical to the Ramones, this band deducts most melody to arrive at music much grimmer and more frightening: Wire would sooner revamp ""The Fat Lady of Limbourg"" or ""Some Kinda Love"" than ""Let's Dance"" or ""Surfin' Bird."" Not that any of the twenty-one titles here have been heard before--that would ruin the overall effect of a punk suite comprising parts so singular that you can hardly imagine them in some other order.

The seven-title selections from the near-perfect Pink Flag, all 12:15 of it, leads off with the fuzzed-up live Roxy London WC2 versions of ""Lowdown"" and ""12XU"" and has the effect of transforming that twenty-one-track marvel of seamless pacing into a string of sardonic punk blowouts. The succinct 1978 single ""Dot Dash"" and the all-out 1979 single ""A Question of Degree"" ease the transition in and out of the transitional Chairs Missing.

Drawing heavily on all three, not as effective a unit as Pink Flag yet kicking off with thirteen of that masterpiece's twenty-one cuts, failing to convert this original skeptic to such 154 indulgences as ""The Other Window"" and the deadly ""A Touching Display,"" mastermind Jon Savage presents a lovingly literal best-of rather than a half-collectorama half-intro like the 1984 Sneaky Pete anthology. But does it hold up, grabbing your collar with one brief, bitter tune after another for almost the entirety of a thirty-one-cut CD. They're not the only punks whose public protests eventually revealed their roots in personal frustration. But their plaints don't seem merely private. They seem emblematic of a time whose cruelties didn't begin and end with alienation, as sad art students sometimes believe, but for damn sure included it.

Except insofar as they're also songs about losing God, they're songs about finding a better if by no means simple substitute. Which is love, of course, easy to say and hard to do in art and life both. Horny on tour, he remembers her entreating ""Don't go breaking my heart."" Taking a drive in the country, he wants to lick the tears from her face but can't unblock his own heart. Telling her she'll be beautiful yet again, he imagines tongues of fire above their heads.

Far more than best-ofs obliged to respect the career he maintained after this hypercharged 1972 night, his legacy is right here, a moment of lost possibility. Withers sang for a black nouveau middle class that didn't yet understand how precarious its status was. Warm, raunchy, secular, common, he never strove for Ashford &amp; Simpson-style sophistication, which hardly rendered him immune to the temptations of sudden wealth--cross-class attraction is what gives ""Use Me"" its kick. He didn't accept that there had to be winners and losers, that fellowship was a luxury the newly successful couldn't afford. Soon sudden wealth took its toll on him while economic clampdown took its toll on his social context. But here he's turned on to be singing to his people--black folks who can afford Carnegie Hall.

Most of these songs hit the charts in a big way before Stevie turned twenty-one last May. Because he's grown up fast, the love lyrics are less teen-specific than a lot of early Smokey, say, but the music is pure puberty. Stevie's rockers are always one step ahead of themselves--their gawky groove is so disorienting it makes you pay attention, like a voice that's perpetually changing.

It's because he's got no use for abstraction--he's technical/physical rather than logical/conceptual. Here once again he treads the fine line between glossolalia and running on at the mouth. Any suggestion that the bitter defeats of ""Living in the City"" are as unfactual as the ""dream come true"" of ""Golden Lady"" is simply irrelevant, because both are the truth--and unless he's snuck one past me and ""Golden Lady"" is about the sun, which would be interesting, that song is the worst one here.

And in themselves the words are much funnier and trickier than the sociospiritual bullshit or Maruice White or Kenny Gamble; as validated by the wit, pace, and variety of the music, they come close to redeeming the whole genre.

The theme is failure, take it or leave it--not just failure to get rich and famous, which does rankle, but failure to love. But their labors imbue both aging-alt whines with excitement and dignity. Anybody who can create a record like this deserves more than 13 thou a year. And anybody capable of ""13 Months in Six Minutes"" deserves another shot at a woman too good to take for granted.

Small, but about perfect, with Walker handling the human detail and Cleaver tossing off metaphors--a sideshow horse, a shunt to drain the fear from his brain. It's an ideal partnership--vocally and lyrically, Walker grounds the old guy and he lifts her. The band sound is more Velvets than Burritos, yet country still. It's as if they've reduced all of white Ohio to an articulated drone, unlocked a silo or warehouse of hummable tunes, and worked out the harmonies.

I love this Cincinnati quartet for singers Chuck Cleaver and Lisa Walker, for songwriters Chuck Cleaver and Lisa Walker, and sometimes for guitarists Chuck Cleaver and Lisa Walker most of all. Where the pained Cleaver dominated their debut, here most tracks are fronted by the more rounded Walker. Not that she's at peace--in songs that feel realistic even though their details seldom kiss and tell, she struggles for love given and received in a state of spiritual hyperawareness suffused with a Christianity that won't let her memory loose. Lovely melodies soften her perpetual uncertainty. But those guitars, gorgeous droning things boosted by keyboards everybody but the drummer takes a hand to, saw away at her unsatisfied mind.

From their records I know this great couple band nobody's heard of to be mordant, obsessive, desperate. But having caught them live in Manhattan last year, I also know them to be urgent, funny, companionable. To be clear, they're a two-male, two-female quartet, but only grizzled fat Chuck Cleaver and lissome tattooed Lisa Walker are a couple. What's worrisome is that if I'm to take their latest songs autobiographically, which is hard to resist after that show, I should say they're a couple-I-hope, not just because I want them to keep making records but because I liked them together--and because this is as brutal a relationship album as Richard &amp; Linda Thompson's Shoot Out the Lights. It starts with a miserable reunion, gets bleaker, sets the tone for its upful moments with the lively ""Happiness Bleeds,"" and keeps on bleeding till a spare, funereal closer with the ominous title ""Las Vegas."" But there's also good news. With Walker's soprano simultaneously reasonable and fraught, Cleaver's rough tenor spooked by Appalachian Cincinnati, their country-drone guitars and locked-in rhythm section never give up, not even on the slow ones. There's hurt there always. But no discernible hate.

I'm so skeptical of unplugged Record Store Day thingies it never occurred to me to sample this one when it materialized last April. This means I was an idiot--when you love a record the way I love their debut, you never know when some alternate version might turn into, say, the live Daydream Nation that other couple group assembled. It also means the limited edition is almost sold out by now. What will you miss if you don't buy it--eek!--right this minute?  Suffering stripped naked beneath the wit, tune, and transcendent noise you long ago learned to love. Detailed knowledge of how nuanced and expressive Chuck and especially Lisa's voice can be, and how delicately they're capable of interacting. Well-turned lyrics you never before had to concentrate on--and yes, they make sense except when they don't, which why should they always when life doesn't either? Acoustic guitars, brushed drums, occasional accordion. And a finale you never knew was so agonizing. Try to break up to that. I dare you.

The first Wussy album in which louder, heavier tub thumper Joe Klug replaces Mo Tucker fan Dawn Burman is also the first he co-produced. There's more distortion, less naturalism; Chuck Cleaver and Lisa Walker yowl more, as when Chuck's aging head voice rises to the challenge of Mark Messerly's organ on ""Pulverized."" These alienation effects help define a rock that generalizes the connubial agony at the band's core, and if this is alienating for those of us who love them as well, it's also comforting, because it distances us from real-life couple Chuck and Lisa's real lives. I'd as soon assume the co-written ""Fly Fly Fly"" was inspired by a dumb young couple they know. I'm glad ""Pizza King""'s tale of permanently adolescent disarray takes place in Indiana, not Ohio.

FALSE,A,The xx,The xx,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14802,"
Their minimalism is so contained that as you warm against your better judgement to the well-spaced notes, subtle depth charges, and ostinato hooks with which they couch their gentle cool, you figure that the matched female-and-male drawls the music sets off will prove unworthy of further commitment. But soon you learn that these two Southwest London 20-year-olds--to leave out their ancillary and now departed guitarist and crucial but probably not generative young producer-drummer--aren't being minimal to prove they're any shade of cool. It's more like they're being minimal because they're shy. Rather than resorting to an obscurantism they're too decent for or feigning a sophistication few achieve, they trade ideas about intimacy as contemporaries, comrades, prospects, lovers, ex-lovers, and friends. It's hard to imagine their music getting much better. But it's not hard to imagine their lives getting much better. Which may be all their music needs.

FALSE,A,Electr-O-Pura,Yo La Tengo,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4247,"
Altern-A-Pura would be more like it. Brimful of punk, fuzz, feedback, noise, and the lovingly amped squelches of fingers sliding off strings, their seventh album is a subcultural tour de force, luxuriating so sybaritically in guitar sound that I'm reluctant to mention that the tunes are pretty good. That's why it's the best record they've ever made, though. Singing's breathy as usual, with Ira yelling when the time is right. As for the lyrics, you know--murmured, gnomic, pop culture references, that kind of thing.

FALSE,A,I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One,Yo La Tengo,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4248,"
No one has made more of bohemian easy-listening--cocktail samba, trance-skronk, good old-fashioned slow ones than Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley, boho dream couple and cultural miniaturists. From the misshapen piano figure that trumps ""Moby Octopad""'s Peter Townshend guitar swell to ""Deeper Into Movies""' raveup workout, from Georgia's simulated Astrud Gilberto cover to James McNew's simulated Neil Young ballad, this is a band that has figured out what makes its faves tick and its tickers beat as one. The very peak is ""Autumn Sweater,"" which with its ""We could slip away"" refrain comes on like (gulp!) a cheating song, only to reveal itself as Ira's diffident, lovestruck tribute to Georgia's companionable support. Modest rather than narrow, their joy and sadness are no less sweet or intense for the larger life they know nothing of.

FALSE,A,Stuff Like That There,Yo La Tengo,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16554,"
Right, it's been a quarter of a century, but how they've changed since Fakebook. There's the bassist around whom Georgia and Ira cohered. There's Georgia's increasingly confident calm meshing with Ira's increasingly thoughtful quiet. There's the fragile, enduring lyricism that's been their musical heart since ""Autumn Sweater,"" and the uneasy, enduring domesticity that goes with it. Ira took the lead on Fakebook's covers, which tended toward a perky cheek now gone. But amazing as ever on this second covers album is his ear for the obscure ditty. The heartbreakingly cute Darlene McCrea opener ""My Heart's Not in It."" The existentially anxious Great Plains midpoint""Before We Stopped to Think."" The Lovin' Spoonful filler ""Butchie's Tune."" Sun Ra's chart-ready ""Somebody's in Love."" Hell, the Cure hit ""Friday I'm in Love."" They also cover themselves and birth a few new ones. But what makes this their loveliest album ever is Ira's ditties combined with Georgia's confident calm. Her ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" isn't Hank's, or Al's either. But in its own way it's just as good, bereft with only the barest show of emotion--she doesn't ever really raise or even intensify her voice. You're forced to wonder, and worry--what's she got to be bereft about, anyway?

FALSE,A,Time Fades Away,Neil Young,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2514,"
This is no desperate throwaway or quickie live album. Loud and dense but never heavy, singing with riffs concocted from the simplest harmonic components, it's squarely country, yet it never hints at nouveau-rockabilly good times. The opener, ""Don't Be Denied,"" is an anthem of encouragement to young hopefuls everywhere that doesn't shrink from laying open fame and its discontents. And the finale, ""Last Dance,"" evokes the day-job hassles that pay for Neil Young tickets, suggests alternatively that ""you can live your own life,"" and then climaxes in a coda comprising dozens of ""no""s wailed over a repetitive back-riff. It must have been strange to watch fans boogieing slowly to this mournful epiphany. But with the Stray Gators (driven by ex-Turtle Johnny Barbata instead of ex-Dylanite Kenny Buttrey) doing as much for Young's brooding, wacked-out originality as Crazy Horse ever did, it sure is exciting to hear.

This should end any lingering doubts as to whether the real Neil Young is the desperate recluse who released two albums in the late '60s or the sweet eccentric who became a superstar shortly thereafter. Better carpentered than Time Fades Away and less cranky than On the Beach, it extends their basic weirdness into a howling facedown with heroin and death itself. It's far from metal machine music--just simple, powerful rock and roll. But there's lots of pain with the pleasure, as after all is only ""natural."" In Boulder, it reportedly gets angry phone calls whenever it's played on the radio. What better recommendation could you ask?

In which the old folkie seeks out his real roots, in folkiedom. Not only is this almost always quiet, usually acoustic and drumless, and sweetened by Nicolette Larson, but it finishes off with a chestnut from the songbook of Ian and Sylvia--not just folkies, but Canadian folkies. Conceptually and musically, it's a tour de force. Occasionally you do wonder why this thirty-two-year-old hasn't learned more about Long-Term Relationships, but the spare, good-natured assurance of the singing and playing deepens the more egregious homilies and transforms good sense into wisdom. The melodies don't hurt either--Young hasn't put together so many winners since After the Gold Rush. Now that it's been done right, maybe all those other guys will hang up their Martins and enroll in bartending school.

FALSE,A,Decade,Neil Young,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2520,"
As usual with compilations by album artists, I prefer the original LPs in both theory and practice. But this triple is done with care right down to the packaging and commentary. The five previously unreleased songs range from pretty good to pretty great, the sides cohere stylistically, and I'd rather hear ""Ohio,"" ""Soldier,"" ""Helpless,"" and ""Long May You Run"" in this context than in any other.

FALSE,A,Freedom,Neil Young,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2530,"
For years it seemed pointless to wait till he found his bearings--his bearings in relation to what? Maybe he still had terrific albums in him, but history had passed him by--his saving eccentricity was no longer an effective weapon against the industrialization of pop, which had to be ignored altogether or taken to the mat. So apropos of nothing he comes up with a classic Neil Young album, deploying not only the folk ditties and rock galumph that made him famous, but the Nashvillisms and horn charts that made him infamous. In addition to sad male chauvinist love songs, it features a bunch of good stuff about a subject almost no rocker white or black has done much with--crack, which seems to have awakened his eccentric conscience (though I bet a Yalie as opposed to cowboy president helped). Does this terrific album mean he's found his bearings? I doubt it. But I no longer put it past him.

FALSE,A,Americana,Neil Young & Crazy Horse,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15689,"
Crazy Horse yam what they yam. You don't like them, take a hike. For all its evocation of war-dance tom-toms, Ralph Molina's thudding beat could just as easily have inspired Young's endnote about the civilization their namesake ""detested"": ""the footsteps of the white man stamped more and more across the land."" In this they resemble, of all things, the United States of America, which has been steamrollering its own past for as long as there've been steamrollers. In vivid contrast to the sanctimonious musicianly overkill of Springsteen's Pete Seeger tribute, Young's overkill leads with its middle finger by ignoring the catchiest tune of the 19th century, the traditional melody of ""Oh Susannah."" But read Young's annotations and learn that this rewrite was itself concocted 50 years ago by forgotten folkie Tim Rose--and then wake up the next morning to learn that it has staying power of its own. Almost every song messes with you that way because almost every song is messed with and almost every song renewed. ""This Land Is Your Land"" advocates trespassing. ""Get a Job"" is accounted ""a genuine folk song with all of the true characteristics."" ""God Save the Queen"" rhymes ""politics"" and ""dirty tricks."" Boom, boom, boom, boom. Sha-na-na-na-na.

True, Jay does deliver such indelible hooks as ""I don't give no fucks"" and ""We bang we bang we bang,"" but musically these sound like Thug's even so. Jay does, however, embody the overarching theme: Bloods the gang rather than blood the squandered bodily fluid, the kind of Bloods who pronounce ""cool"" ""bool"" because hard C's are bursewords, or so Thug tells us. You should be glad you can't make out the lyrics. Bloods, Crips--most humans don't see much difference.

Whatever his ultimate standing as social critic or present-day composer who refuses to die, Zappa was everything he claimed to be on this 19-cut, 40-minute sendup of the Summer of Love. No, it wasn't like this; most of the naive teens who lost-and-found themselves in the Haight were sweeter and smarter than the ""phony hippies"" he lacerates with such hopeless contempt. But that doesn't mean his cruelty isn't good for laughs. And not only is every wee tune--motive, as composers say--as well-crafted as a Coke commercial, they all mesh together into one of those musical wholes you've read about. With bohemia permanent and changed utterly, this early attack on its massification hasn't so much dated as found its context. Cheap sarcasm is forever.

From ""Age Ain't Nothing but a Number"" when she was 15 to ""More Than a Woman"" just before she died (the latter included, the former discreetly not), she was lithe and dulcet in a way that signified neither jailbait nor hottie--an ingenue whose selling point was sincerity, not innocence and the obverse it implies. Timbaland's beats add essential eccentricity, but R. Kelly's ditties suited her almost as well.

Since Bowie and Ferry sold surface in disguise back when they were supposedly saving rock and roll, I don't worry about this tribute band's lack of depth.

Not that he's above imagining blow jobs like any other healthy young rapper--cf. ""SOPA,"" which insofar as it's about the Online Piracy Act has a special place in its trickerating heart for porn sites. He's just a gifted kid who likes his weed and his words, which he twists with palpable delight around sparse synth beats musical enough to layer on some delight of their own. And then there's the closing trifecta: his beautiful ideals, his tragic life, and a scabrous Black Hippy remix for the fun of it.

""Mischievous, mysterious, miscellaneous,"" he calls himself--with exceptional self-awareness if you ask me. This big reader with the pathologically light-sensitive eyes will never write a senior thesis--college rap he ain't, which is a positive, nuhmean? But his music emanates intellectual excitement and pleasure as he grows up. Confused though the particulars of his ""heroine addiction"" are, his tree-huffing doggishness recedes whenever he rhymes his feminist-curious yearnings, and if his politics are too Aleister Crowley, at least he's down with the Beatles' psychedelic seer rather than Zeppelin's megalomaniac. As listening, more fun than his fellow Black Hippy's outtakes for sure. As wordplay too. As thinking, leaves room for improvement and reason to hope there'll be some.

The parents of its intended audience might recognize a P.M. Dawn vibe in this 20-year-old's teen-targeted pop/rap concept album about a confused young middle-class black male's requited love for a white football player. His mom's homophobia includes kids who sometimes think they're bisexual like her boy; his inamorato's parents are down with the gays but ""hate niggers""; his boyfriend has a girlfriend too. So of course sometimes he hates himself, as in: ""I hate my yearbook photo/I hate my passport/I hate my last name/I hate everything it stands for/[wait, he's not done] I should probably transfer."" But other times he's transported instead, saved from himself by the love he shares. Here he raps, there he croons. Frank Ocean pal Michael Uzowuru is with him both ways.

The Opry fixture and publishing mogul is well-served by a series format that combines a few very famous songs with half-forgotten hits and unreleased vaultorama of varying quality. He's granted 14 cuts instead of the series' usual 10 or 12, and because he relies on tried and true folk melodies, the new stuff gets friendly real fast. In fact, although John Morthland recommends the Time-Life box, this is all the Acuff I need. Not unlike the Kingston Trio, the Smoky Mountain Boys were folkie populizers who turned sentimental expression into sentimental entertainment. An education in mountain sensibility (and less obtrusively professional than Greatest Hits, which is less obtrusive than Acuff's label hopping post '40s remakes), the sampling is genuine Americana for sure. But Americana that's conscious of its own Americanness never hits home like the real thing.

The Message, the unavailable-in-the-U.S. Nigerian LP that precedes this made-for-export overview conceptually, actually comes closer to pop--it's brighter, edgier, more tuneful. The music here is all flowing undulation; even the experimental synthesizer interjections, while recalling the startling syn-drums of great disco, seem somehow rubberized, springing suddenly outward and then receding back into the slipstream. It's almost as if Chris Blackwell, aware that it was absurd to think AOR, aimed instead for a kind of ambient folk music that would unite amateur ethnologists, Byrne-Eno new-wavers, reggae fans, and hip dentists, just for starters. But never fear--not only do these confident, magical, surpassingly gentle polyrhythms obviate the organic and the electronic, the local and universal, they also make hash of distinctions between background and foreground.

Ade is no longer a signifier of polyrhythmic African mystery--he's a lesson learned and absorbed.

AD is Schenectady-born, Rhinebeck-based, African-American attorney Antonio Delgado, Democratic candidate for Congress in New York's 19th district, where the mealy-mouthed Republican incumbent has gone after him for this hip-hop EP he recorded in 2007. And how about that? Not only doesn't it deploy ""phrases derogatory to women"" or--wha?--""glorif[y] pornography and drug use."" It's also really good. Suavely articulated over simple, dramatic beats, every word is thought through and all five songs work as songs. The special standouts are ""U Scared,"" where ""There's a war going on"" evokes America's ongoing race and class combat while dissing both black-on-black violence and ""pop like a pimple"" rap, and ""Draped in Flags,"" the best-informed Iraq War song this side of Becky Warren's ""Get Calm, Stay Low."" A DCCC poll has Delgado's jobs-and-healthcare campaign seven points ahead in a predominantly white district where John Hall of Orleans served two House terms a decade ago. So get on it, my peeps in New Paltz with its SUNY hipsters and Oneonta with its SUNY pop music program, in Hunter no longer just a ski town and Hudson now an exurban hub. This 2016 iteration of the EP is filled out with ""clean"" versions you can do without, although the a cappella ""U Scared"" is a keeper. So you could just download the songs.

If the song doctors prescribed ""I'd rather be O.D.in' on the/Crack of her ass,"" not to mention ""It's like gettin' head from a guillotine,"" they were worth every point. And though at first you may miss the killer cut, the ""My Fist Your Face"" or ""Janie's Got a Gun,"" in fact the midtempo, classic-rock, love-as-pain ""Cryin'"" should prove irresistible to anyone who doesn't equate good art with doing something new.

But sometimes his meanings are there for the taking, as on the thematic ""9-5ers Anthem,"" and the self-fulfilling ""No Regrets,"" about an 87-year-old outsider artist on her obscure and happy deathbed. The beats have a subtle logic of their own, like the medina saxophone on one cut that sets up the heavenly houris on the next.

I don't know much about dope, I just know what I like: his beats, which average out to deep organ funk; his rhymes, which half-parse no matter how twisted; and his class consciousness--unlike ""Bulletproof Wallets,"" his ""Nickel Plated Pockets"" are stuffed (they wish) with spare change. Title track gave us the great verse on Labor Days: ""Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman/You only call her a bitch because she won't let you get that pussy/Maybe she just didn't feel y'all shared similar interests/Maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet-talk a princess.""

Indubitably brilliant, indubitably self-referential, Aes has exorcised his depressive demons with admirable tenacity since 2001. But for me the charm of his vast vocabulary, Google-ready references, and indecipherable significations wore off before he was 30, so it was mainly his ace collaborations with Kimya Dawson and Homeboy Sandman that inspired me to cue this up. Just two plays in I was loving a bunch of tracks: about his brothers, his shrink, his kitten, the passed-forward tattoos and dreadlocks of young servers at Baskin-Robbins and the local juice place, and his tour of duty with the neighborhood varmint patrol. Since all these songs were uncommonly literal for Aes, I wasn't surprised when the rest proved harder to parse.

Get a strong--like a, like a Rottweiler or a, a boxer dog, not a, a Pomeranian dog."" And while both the anti-wack jokes of the peppy ""Katz"" and the freak sociology of the echoing ""Environmental Studies"" run deep, the prize is the penultimate ""So Strange Here,"" as soulful a reflection on the disorientations of B-list tour-or-get-a-day-job as you can think of offhand.

Hoping against hope that it's some fucking place, I occasionally find myself suspecting that cut-up and dub are where the semipop action is. Enthusiasm, iconoclasm, and willingness to live in the present make it the avant alternative to neoclassicism--aware of the weight of history and the unavoidability of received materials, but also aware that past glories have been and gone. Then I listen to Curlew or Fats Comet or Mute Beat or Version X and go back to my four-four. Thing is, the semipop action ought to be more than metaphorical; rock bricolage is too cerebral and reggae subtract-a-track too spacy to work that body. Although in my casual experience Adrian Sherwood's vast output combines both problems, this fourth album by one of his array of studio-only projects adds minimelodies galore and a shifting but reliable bass-and-drum pulse--Jamaica steeped in field recordings and heavy machinery--to the usual panorama of depth charges, funny noises, exotic rips, and spoken words.

Forthright expression can be cathartic, however, and so, with advice from Butch Vig (of Garbage, not Nirvana), Gabel and his cohort power out 10 hard-edged anthems that will piss off the right people--not the D.C. courtier class, who could care less, but alt types who find the sociopolitical inauthentic, uncool and the rest of that rot.

If Ghanaians warmed to the palm-wine antecedents and Ashanti flavor of his musicianship, what Euros hear is his innate, acculturated gift for rhythm-melody and his conviction that scaling postcolonial highlife down to size doesn't mean traditionalizing it altogether.

But overwrought though he may be, Franklin James Fisher is more approachable than Stefan Burnett, and not just because he declines to weaponize his dick.

Untouched by reggae, funk, hip hop, or the spindrift impressionism of the postmodern love man, this kind of blindered formal command can only be learned from records--from aural data free of inhibiting social complications.

Just to help out, her well-attuned producers pretend that ska was a basic pop component in an era not yet lost.

Even when that bliss devolves into a painful argument, she can put it into song, and though the bite that was her premarital specialty has softened, give her credit--marital bliss is a theme few lyricists sharpen much at all.

This time he sings like Kinky Friedman with a sense of humor, doing a lot better by his own words than Butch Hancock, the only lyricist in Texas (maybe anywhere) who merits a comparison. From football heroes gone wrong to noble floozies to farmers fiddling while Washington burns, he's a tale-spinning poet of the Panhandle, with local color provided by Joe Ely's homeboys.

Only the rowdy ""Shadow of a Man"" and the cheatin' ""Sad State of Affairs"" come equipped with Nashville markers. The rest are just well-turned songs of the heart.

""Dreaming's Killing Me,"" she knows it, only then it's ""Thank God for the wine/That made me lose my mind"" and also ""loosened up his tongue."" The finale is a love duet with her producer in which she proposes they ""leave the world behind."" It'll never work out.

Always eager to set young martini users on any path of righteousness they'll take, I duly note these piano-tinkling blues. Probably not obscure enough, I know--the goddamn Who covered ""Young Man Blues,"" and it was Old Man Mose himself who taught middle-class white boys about ""Seventh Son."" What's more, his catalogue remains hopeless after three compilations--one an absurd minibox containing three mediocre CBS albums, another a two-CD Rhino job with liner notes from Kitschmaster Irwin Chusid, who wouldn't mention all the pretentious over-the-hill drivel on disc two even if he was working for free. That leaves this modest item, remastered with the wrong bonus tracks in 1988, which I first heard in 1963 and eventually bought for under two bucks (and if you want something to be nostalgic about, that price is it). Instrumentally, Allison was an accompanist who sold himself as a soloist, but when he bent his insouciant drawl to the black pop songwriting of his '40s youth, he articulated a unique Ole Miss cool that paralleled rockabilly's working-class heat. Trio-era Nat King Cole as riverboat gambler, say. Fun without slumming.

This Mississippi farmboy turned US serviceman turned Louisiana State English-philosophy grad turned jazz pianist-singer-songwriter died November 15, four days past an 89th birthday that couldn't have been the happiest for a Southern progressive. His relaxed drawl and time made him Sun Records' contemporary in the South's white-man-sings-the-blues sweepstakes, plus he could write. But because he identified jazz he didn't get an all-vocal album until the 1963 Prestige comp fMose Allison Sings, soon a totem for young aesthetes like Pete Townshend and Bonnie Raitt. From a base of Prestige standards like the Who cover ""Young Man's Blues"" and the John Mayall-etc. cover ""Parchman Farm,"" this fortuitously timed new selection mines his uneven late-'60s Atlantic book, which has plenty to offer--the philosophical ""Jus' Like Livin',"" the physiological ""Your Molecular Structure,"" the reassuring ""You Can Count on Me,"" the endangered ""Back on the Corner,"" the paranoid ""Foolkiller,"" the strategically taciturn ""I'm Not Talkin'"" itself. My favorite is ""Western Man,"" which begins: ""Western man had a plan / And with his gun in his hand / Free from doubt / Went right out / On the world."" Pretty ominous if you know what's coming. But he managed to give it a happier ending than he lived to see.

Simplicity can be a virtue--the nice thing about the Allmans is that when they put two five-year-olds on the cover we know it's not some ""decadent"" joke. Gregg Allman is a predictable singer who never has an unpredictable lyric to work with anyway, and the jams do roll on, but at their best--""Ramblin' Man,"" a miraculous revitalization of rock's earliest conceit--they just may be the best, and on this album Dickey Betts's melodious spirituality provides unity and renewal.

The best live album of their career because both age and youth suit them, and because--just compare this 2003-vintage double-CD to the recently dug-out Atlanta International Pop Festival set or the expanded Live at the Fillmore East--they're better now than they ever were. Right, the original Allmans were true visionaries, and there's no reason to think Warren Haynes or Derek Trucks would have become what they became in the blank space that vision filled. But both have more chops than 2001 layoff Dickey Betts or, sorry, Duane himself. On their solo/leader records, both prove better-than-average virtuosos. But in the band context they have the good sense to play Duane's kind of music. Power audio, curtailed drum solos, and songs not yet buried alive in the uncharted expanses of the Allmans' live catalog finish the concept, and at 55 Gregg finally sounds as if there's more to a man's life than the parlous fate of his latest erection.

""Twee"" is such a screwy synonym for ""concrete."" True, transplanted Londoner Elizabeth Morris does sport a fetching murmur that's rather sexy if like me you're attracted to cinemaphiles who appreciate kissing, and her attendant g-b-d do tend toward strum and clatter. But she's not as dreamy or small as ""twee"" implies--her ""heart is as strong as a drummer,"" exactly. She's rooted, sensible, manifestly on top of the facts and possibilities of her life as it is, which since she's still young and relatively privileged include cooking chili with her sweety and swimming in Sweden in the summertime. In short, she's getting it while she can and knows it. If this band thing doesn't work out--as it probably will for a time, because she has the tunes--she can put off finishing that ""legal vocation."" Then she'll go back to school and join a professional class that doesn't command as much slack as it used to either.

The magic of the debut wasn't just that thing that happens with young bands when everything is new and bliss is just around the corner. It's that Elizabeth Morris recognized this illusion as an illusion and entered wholeheartedly into its ebullience anyway. But now the Old World's cold weather and cramped spaces are getting her down--her most irresistible new song, taken solo with ukulele, recalls a blistering summer day down under when they found a Go-Betweens tape in the car. Though her tempos have slowed half a turn, reducing the twee factor if that was a problem for you, her melodies are still very much there and her lyrics are sharp throughout. But she's no longer at all confident that talent will out or love endures--her ""This is life, this is livin'"" is more resigned than celebratory, copping to her suspicion that a great night in bed will never be repeated. So let me assure her that at least she hasn't ""already met all the people that'll mean something."" Some of them haven't even been born yet. And I don't mean the kids I bet she's not sure she'll ever have.

If you don't, she's too good for you. The latter isn't great for her numbers and she knows it. But she'll settle.

Yes his own songs top the covers, only there's a Tom Russell vignette you'd swear he made up; yes the old songs top the new ones, only check the Nashville-simple Rosie Flores duet.

To call this the best record of his solo career isn't to claim it's great, it's to reckon that it's pretty darn good. At 55, young Dave has found his voice, which echoes somewhere on the outskirts of Johnny Cash territory, and the songs strike old notes so truly they could be new: loner quests (a half-blind Golden Glover, a bounty hunter with nothing to lose), lost bard (Johnny Ace this time), union man (he beat U.S. Steel and got beat anyway), sex in the present (he loves her dirty nightgown) and past (one inamorata was a union maid on the side). He even hooks up with his brother for some forced jocularity that's the truest note of all. Remember when Phil was supposed to be the singer?

He loves a good lyric, and if he can't write them or order them up, he has only to ransack his record collection for oldies that are just strange enough. Mixing country blues with Cab Calloway, Peetie Wheatstraw's murderous ""Gangster's Blues"" with a supremely mournful country song called ""Collins Cave,"" he goes for narrative and gets it. The arrangements range from very spare to orchestral, and never mind Tower of Power--Alvin goes to Sun Ra when he wants Ellingtonia, Dirty Dozen when he wants polyphony. The only exception to all this smart stuff is a perfectly OK ""Daddy Rollin' Stone."" I hope it breaks AOR, I bet it won't, and I wish he didn't have to bother.

From what I gather--she's not forward about it and has no obligation to be--when I refer to the Molly Rankin of this album I mean the Molly Rankin character. The biographical Molly Rankin seems committed to an ongoing romantic relationship with guitarist Alec O'Hanley. The character is more rootless or footloose, hence easier for young indie-rockers to relate to--easier to write songs for, too. Where her debut topped a bunch of cannot-love songs with the upbeat ""Archie, Marry Me,"" here Archie is gone, and despite a few independent-female-on-the-town moments, the lyrical evidence doesn't bespeak an emotional life fit to support an album. But the musical evidence does. It's an optimistic alt-pop she calls ""plimsoll,"" a retro flourish no one else with comparable brains and backbone risked in 2017 (though I alvvays thought it was ""plimsoul""). For 10 tracks running, Rankin and O'Hanley's little band ring the bell every time, and while the hooks and harmonic tricks are nothing new, they have more brio than most. So Molly the bandleader and Molly the character have a key virtue in common: they know what they want and know how to get it.

Got that? ""Disconcert and seduce while recycling African, American, and European musics with a false naï¿½ï¿½ï¿"" only in French it sounds better. Just like the accompanying lyric, whose minitrot reads, ""Here we come singing for freedom, happiness and love all over the world."" And that's not even to mention the Bambara one summarized as ""Welcome to women who respect their husbands."" Cheap and charming, they play and sing with the multicultural comfort Malians who emigrate to Abidjan and then Paris rarely find the fit for.

Although their French hits-plus are solider than the songs on their new Manu Chao album, on both records these Malians' pop ambition trumps their soul training, pop-by-ambition trumps soulful-by-training. Here their European label performs the old trick of stitching a pretty good CD out of three lesser ones.

No Malians more eagerly downplay their nation's sun-slowed intensity than this Parisian couple, so it was a good idea to introduce them to Manu Chao, whose breakthrough concept gentled up international sounds into reggae lite with brains. Though the pair's warp and weave are softened as a result, the beat remains theirs, and though they're less brainy than Chao, there's bite in their ineluctable Malian-ness. For social content, they take on the danger truck drivers pose to giraffes, hippopotamuses, elephants, chickens, and children.

As if their charming calculation has become routine--maybe for them, maybe for us--this never takes off the way Welcome to Mali did. But it does hang in there, and rewards attention, especially as regards its many cameos: less big names Santigold and TV on the Radio than Tuareg guitarist Abdallah Oumbadougou shredding louder than Nick Zinner or Scissor Sister Jake Shears disco and proud. Not so welcome is perpetual guest Bertrand Cantat, a lapsed French rocker-activist who did a mere four years for beating his girlfriend to death in 2003. True, Cantat's harmonica tenses nicely against Ahmed Fofana's ngoni in ""Sans Toi."" But mostly he sings, and he's no Tunde Adebimpe or Kyp Malone. There's such a thing as taking tolerance too far.

There's enough natural hip here to last most Southern boogie bands a career, with the added attraction that this isn't a Southern boogie band, not hardly, despite the Memphis locus and blues inflections.

The canonical recording is The First Day, Ammons's first studio session with Meade Lux Lewis, which launched Alfred Lion's even more canonical Blue Note label in 1938. But its status partly reflects the room it makes for Lewis's blues feeling, which in truth is nothing special--there are hundreds of better blues players across the spectrum, from Speckled Red to Otis Spann to Thelonious Monk. For the left-hand speed rolls and right-hand sparklers that are why the world cares about Ammons and Lewis, this knowledgeably annotated excavation tops the Blue Note easily. I'd prefer more duets, but although there may be something better out there, I doubt the improvement would justify the search. Most of it was recorded live at a radio broadcast from a Chicago hotel in 1939, which given how uncomplicated it is to mike a piano is of no sonic consequence; the last four songs are from a stray studio session. Eighteen tracks in all, most under three minutes and three under two, with Lewis taking half a dozen and Pete Johnson a pair. You want blues feeling, try Lewis's ""Chapel Blues."" You want Ammons to shout for joy, wait till he gets away from those radio guys and lets loose in the studio.

The tenor battle in which two saxmen blow each other's brains out is a format often cited and seldom documented, and as someone who's sought examples for years, I feel lucky I threw on this live CD--released 2000, recorded 1973. Zoot Sims and Lockjaw Davis's roughly similar The Tenor Giants Featuring Oscar Peterson is hobbled by jazz decorum and a stiffer rhythm section; the justly legendary 1950 meeting of these two Billy Eckstine grads, ""Blues Up and Down,"" is constipated by comparison. The Baltimore crowd brings out the brawler in both Albert's boy Gene, with his woogie-steeped r&amp;b tendencies, and the famously facile Stitt, known for his eagerness to replicate Bird solos and cut crap in the studio for cash on the barrelhead. The combat is friendly and uncerebral--Stitt pushes Ammons's big gruff Hawkins chops toward modernism as Ammons drives Stitt to a raucous showboat bebop that keeps on churning as tracks approach the quarter-hour mark. Cedar Walton, Sam Jones, and the incomparable Billy Higgins are so fluid you hardly mind when the leaders sit out for a Walton feature, and the 2002 sequel is almost as good even though two Etta Jones vocals intrude. Called Left Bank Encores, it was cut the very same night. Must have been some show.

More often he's a cheerleader, as on ""Highlife Dancing,"" with its good Ghanaian sunshine, and ""Babicue,"" where champagne will be served. So sweet he has no need for Auto-Tune, he butters it on anyway, and as with the sentimentality the music just gets more beautiful as a result. He tries so hard you'd be a cad to tell him no.

Anand's synthesizers, on the other hand, are obviously world music, and this very rock-era composer, dubbed Jude Matthew by his Catholic schoolteacher father and Victory Ecstasy by himself, is a pomo dream. Does he have no shame? The usual amount, probably; the usual amount of taste, too, given his unusual amount of formal training. But in a classic pop meld of artistic innovation and audience appetite, he'll try anything. He doesn't exploit a Vegas-soul horn chart or Indian mode or bluegrass run or Eurodisco beat or the anonymous ur-soprano of a thousand previous soundtracks or any of countless other distinct usages, strings included, because it'd make a cool juxtaposition. He just thinks it'd sound good there, and most of the time he's right. Makes you wonder why John Zorn bothers.

That pleasant chore done, it's one exemplary piece of Nashville after another, many with his name on them. He sketches a generic small town, reclaims the eponymous country, rings changes on autumn and ""I Used To Love Her,"" and ends up in one of his white-trash paradises bouncing on a trampoline. ""Jump On It,"" that one's called--belongs right up there with Aretha, Van Halen, and the Pointer Sisters.

Like protest singers, novelty artists put too much strain on the words. Anderson's performance, as they say, is richer and subtler than Si Kahn's or John Prine's. But her music is more, as they say, minimal, which diminishes replay potential. Don't get me wrong--she achieves moments of humor so exquisite (timing and timbre of the pilot's chuckles on ""From the Air,"" for instance) that I just have to hear them again, and when I do I enjoy the rest. But while Anderson's alienated patriotic (and romantic) affection is clearly her own invention, it's just as clearly a variant on your basic boho Americanism (and sexuality)--a variant that adds only a voice, not words, by which I mean ideas. Richard Pryor she ain't.

And though for sheer wordcraft I'll still take Dave Alvin or August Darnell, as art-rock lyricists go she's top-class--compare Fripp &amp; Co., or collaborator Peter Gabriel. Given how often art-rock projects are sunk by literary malfeasance, not to mention Anderson's fundamentally verbal shtick, she'd better be. And given how often art-rock projects are sunk by silly music, it's a good thing too that this putative violinist-composer has accrued so much studiocraft, utilizing sometime co-producer Bill Laswell not so much to pin down a groove as to perfect the kind of coloristic electronic effects semiexperimentalists like to fool around with. As a result, the aural content is as suggestive as the lyrics, with a sensuality and sonic panache Anderson the narrator has no trouble living up to. For art-rock, rich stuff.

A credible groove ain't a compelling groove, and I'm inclined to blame the auteur rather than Nile Rodgers, Jimmy Bralower, or even Adrian Belew. But this soundtrack establishes her as a dynamite entertainer nevertheless. Her timing and intonation are so slick that even when she says something strange you catch yourself taking it for granted. Most of her material is perfectly comprehensible to anybody with a working knowledge of lower Manhattan. And if you're thinking this is faint praise, stop condescending--she's got more to say than 98 percent of those plodders, stumblers, and lurchers whose chief aim in life is keeping their avant-garde credentials in order.

By electing to expend his Dutch East India advance on a fancy tape recorder instead of the Velvet Underground reunion, this Austin singer-songwriter acquired the means to preserve his songs in analog form, and here's the fruit. There were two good albums and then three marginal ones over two decades, so who'd expect a grab bag to be his best? Yet it is. With all four tracks laid down DIY, it's even squarer rhythmically than his norm, and his calm drawl verges on the spectral. But it also verges on the hypnotic, and the guy can write stories and work up tunes. After a brief fanfare, there's an opener about the Donner Party so gruesome and precise I sometimes skip to the merely spooky ""Heckling Houdini."" Also featured are a 33-year-old groupie-turned-granny, a cross-dressing uncle, Ubangi-stomping Warren Smith, a painfully slow lunch with Nefertiti a few years or millennia too late, driving till you're dizzy in a dumbshit town, and the one about lost love and ""Antihistamines"": ""Chlorpheniramine, Diphenhydramine,/Doxylamine, Phenindamine,/Tripolidine and Pheniramine,/I can't cure my pain with antihistamines.""

Right, he's made an album about enjoying success without overdoing the cars and chains. But the most cultural song here is the staying-alive crowd-pleaser ""Celebrate,"" where the operative metaphor is ""fixin' up the tree""--the endangered family tree he husbands belatedly throughout. Culturally, however, the trouble he puts up with from the woman he loves is a bigger deal. Assume she's one woman and assume he loves her as much as ever--the biographical .Paak is married with a son no longer a toddler.

At the far end of a trajectory determined by Noel Coward and Shel Silverstein, we come upon Steven Spielberg's answer to Aladdin and the Archies, where three actors I never heard of--Jess Hornell as acutely all-American Wakko, Rob Paulsen as thickly Liverpudlian Yakko, and Tress MacNeille as precocious little Dot--warble a significant body of new nonsense songs. The music is ""Turkey in the Straw,"" Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, Offenbach, and lesser cliches, all rendered in loungecore-ready registers. But three writers with suspiciously similar surnames (Rogel, Rugg, Ruegger) furnish lyrics that are suitable for children (which makes the mildly risque moments more fun), occasionally educational (""Yakko's World"" lists U.N. members, ""The Presidents"" mentions Nixon's ignoble end and says Jefferson wrote the Constitution), and always clever fun, especially on the reissued debut that fills out this two-CD, one-hour box. Maybe you can live without the cannily self-referential ""I Am the Very Model of a Cartoon Individual."" But don't you have something to learn from ""All the Words in the English Language""?

For any Upper West Side showbiz kid, musical comedy is mother's milk, more ""natural"" than the rude attack of rock or the polite confessional of folk. And having gone mega, Fiona was autonomous enough to want it that way. With crucial help from Jon Brion, she's got the Richard Rodgers/Kurt Weill part down, and will surely tackle the Dorothy Fields/Lorenz Hart part later. Meanwhile, confessional attacks like ""A Mistake"" and ""Get Gone"" will do. Webber &amp; Sondheim, watch out.

Instead of delivering the music a sharp-tongued breakup record by an empowered young female would imply--if not folk-rock plain and simple, then emotional piano-woman pop--Apple adapts Broadway show tune to confessional mode. Although Mike Elizondo adds momentum, Jon Brion's colors still predominate, and the melodic and structural contours are all Apple's. Ira Gershwin she's not; Betty Comden she's not either. But she wouldn't be half as inspiring if they were what she was aiming for.

A funny thing will happen once you've figured out that the title is the stupidest thing about an album that's damn catchy after all. It'll sound like a piano record--a defiantly primitivist, raucously avant-garde lounge singer's piano record, with a really nutty drummer: he'll-bang-on-anything (and-get-her-to-pitch-in) producer Charley Drayton. There are few arpeggios, and not much tone color and such. She just executes simple figures and hammers thick chords, including a few boogie-woogies just to make a point. She also sings--words, yes, but more decisively, sounds. Not background music. But you could sure call it mood music.

Robert Schneider's second pass at homemade Beatles conquers his embarrassment over how much he adores this stuff. Stripped of sonic camouflage, the songs are consistently pretty, fanciful, and slight, as clear as existential questions can be. Half a dozen ways he wonders whether he can lose himself forever in this music--and by so doing, find himself. You don't have to believe in harmony to grant him the right to try.

Alternative young people may need all the Beatles/Spector-Wilson/Zep-Sly foofaraw to grasp a band who avoid roots sound effects yet put songwriting first. To me they're just syncretic, like all pop if you listen deep, only here shallow will do fine. In typical Elephant Six fashion, they're busy and fussy and can't stop their minds from wandering. But with Robert Schneider fixing the holes, the lyrics swirl around sensibly and the formidable tunesmithing never goes down the drain. Nostalgic and in love with love, he's as American as all get-out or Steve Earle.

After years of taking the band name literally, I realized that not even Magical Mystery Tour was this arch. If Robert Schneider's falsetto affect evokes the '60s, it's such extreme cases as the Hollies of ""Carrie-Anne"" and the Small Faces of ""Itchycoo Park,"" a narrow frame of reference even as formalism goes. Here it's played for teen ambience rather than musicianly musing. The gurl cameos help, as does the antigurl Beach Boys closer, but since the teens it speaks for are as imaginary as the era it honors, that Schneider (just barely) brings the conceit off is the usual tribute to his songwriting chops. If he had anything to say, he could be a contender.

Conceived as new merch to sell on an American tour that ended before the pressing was ready, this three-track EP doubles as an economical introduction. Its near-frantic four-and-half-minute? opener is guitar-driven. Its trickier five-minute closer is drum-driven. And for the seven-minute wedding song in between she relaxes a little with her ngoni guy before the guitar guy has his say. Not fatiguing, that's for sure.

Initially, I spun this album to get rid of it--to insure that, as with most unmarked CDs in jewelcases lacking title and slug line, it was safe to stick it where the laser don't shine. Only after I realized how impressed I was by these grooveless, tuneless electronic instrumentals did I make out on the back cover the birthname of my old NYU student Alejandro Ghersi--who as Arca has since become a Yeezus collaborator and Fader cover boy as well as co-producing a Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rk album I'll leave to her fanbase. In other words, I really liked this music before I knew I knew its creator. Those who claim it has a structure as opposed to a sequence are probably imagining things.""Umbilical"" with its Mbuti chant, ""Sinner"" with its virtual bellows breathing in and out, ""Faggot"" with its bells-and-choirboy undergirding and stuttering aggro finale. But tune in anytime during this 20-track hour and chances are you'll hear something you've never heard before--and want to hear it again, to make sure you were right the first time.

Since Alejandro Ghersi once took a class from me, discretion suggested that I respectfully note the existence of this unballyhooed abstract work from a sonic universe I seldom sample and leave it at that. But as has happened before with Arca, who's too big a deal to need my belated attention, I enjoyed its sounds too much not to say so--the lowing of ""Torero,"" the booming of ""Cement Garden Interlude,"" the preindustrial clatter of ""Pargo."" I also enjoyed Micachu's reflections on gender identity in 5:28's ""Baby Doll."" To simulate closure, however, it relies on the kind of choirboy soprano that's signified transcendence, spirituality, and other such rot since there were castrati who were known as such, and as ever I'm unconvinced.

First you notice that the opener really is kinda gorgeous, with its twin-xylophone-echoed piano flourish and all. Then you isolate Win Butler's sob and fantasize about throttling the twit, an immature impulse unmitigated by the lyrics, which are histrionic even for a guy who's just lost a grandparent (or whoever). But if you keep at it till the next song, which tells the story of his runaway older brother getting bitten by a vampire, you begin to admire his resilience--he's retained a sense of the ridiculous, which is more than you can say of most young twits who sing about losing a grandparent (or whoever). And that's how the album goes--too fond of drama, but aware of its small place in the big world, and usually beautiful. N.B.: if you're considering Montreal, which is certainly my favorite Canadian place, the ex-Texans and -Haitian here want to make clear that it's horribly cold.

With beats this straight and stolid, you'd better keep the anthems coming, and they do, almost. Acclimate yourself and maybe you'll check in with track three (at 1:20, the ""chosen few"" stuff) or even track two (just 29 seconds until ""Businessmen they drink my wine""). Certainly track four, the sub-four-minutes reproach ""Rococo"" (""ro-co-co-ro-co-co-ro-co-co-ro-co-co,"" although that rendering shortchanges the rhythmic nuances). Then you'll put the record aside for a week or two, and when you return you'll be back to backgrounding it till track five, six seconds of violin pre-climax to the speedy intro to the sub-three-minutes Rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""Empty Room,"" followed hard on by the determined ""City With No Children."" After that it'll be as back-and-forth as Win Butler's thematics till Ms. Chassagne climaxes the opus with the wholehearted ""Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)."" Then you'll remember just why you wanted to put it on, and soon you'll be coming in at ""Rococo"" yet again.

Expecting some avant-ambient acid jazz venture, you put it on and wonder why the other guys can't be this smart. Then you check the personnel and decide it's because these aren't actually avant-ambient acid jazz guys--just Bill Laswell indulging his fondness for post-Coltrane saxophone and post-Hendrix guitar. But since Laswell has long explored these tastes with depressingly competent results, you transfer credit to the late Tony Williams. Unfortunately, Williams hadn't been making such focused records either. So, with Buckethead and Nicky Skopelitis ruled out as decisive variables, the secret comes down to this: Pharoah Sanders doing his thing, Graham Haynes being told what his is.

All punky, all dissonant, all yet to be melded into one of them seamless wholes. But I say the bits and pieces of the most musical band in Alternia beat the fully realized works of art of mortal road heroes. In fact, I say they are fully realized works of art.

What verbal content you can parse might be sardonic if it carried any emotional weight at all--conned customers, security from LAX to JFK, assassination on Christmas eve. Yet it's too hoarse and wild to seem detached or even deadpan; basically what it gives off is intelligence, as a given you live with rather than a goal you achieve. The import's in croaked, wild, intelligent music that's also virtuosic, especially up against the myriad alt bands who fancy themselves players these days. The controlled discord of the four instrumentals recalls the compositional smarts of Eric Bachmann's sax-based Barry Black, but the nasty little guitar lines have Eric Johnson all over them, and bass and drums put in their two bits as well. True, their WEA debut could be more songful. But don't blame them for making the most of the cognitive dissonance that is their lot.

Hey, we all have our personal alt-rock standbys--campaigners who've stuck out a sound that rings our chimes dead center. So if I tell you mine are the Voidoids revisited, will I maybe make a sale? Two guitars, one choppy and one fleet, rip up bebop-worthy dissonances over punk forcebeats, and if the frontman seems less than charismatic, well, Richard Hell types never hold their bands together for six years. Seeker that he is, Eric Bachmann varies croak with tweetle, massages some keybs, even samples. Minor details, I insist. This is their sound, there is none higher, other indie bands should just retire.

The great thing about this album is how untranscendent it is, as if these lads know the guitar-band pleasures are cons. Sing-along tunes? Breakneck momentum? Next-big-thing ambition? Saturday-night swindles every one. Instead Alex Turner and crew evoke club life as it is actually experienced. They sound like not knowing the doorman, like moving on a girl you think isn't pretty enough, like missing the bus in a leather jacket that doesn't keep out the cold. Many details are too U.K.-specific for Yank-yob gratification. But aesthetes will come to enjoy Turner's nuanced adenoids and his bandmates' thought-through arrangements.

After myriad albums of which I've heard half a dozen, 2010's mysteriously well-regarded non-DIY debut Before Today all too prominent among them, Ariel Rosenberg sneaks in a good one. By cult say-so a no-fail songsmith denied his place in the stratosphere by his lo-fi principles (cf. Daniel Johnston, Robert Pollard, Kurt Vile), he gears up his factory to roll out a line of relatable tunes, many with relatable lyrics attached, adding up to . . . songs! These tend silly whether stubbornly kinky (the betesticled statement of musical intentions ""Kinski Assassin,"" the ""symphony"" for a ""nympho at the bibliotech"") or proudly ridiculous (the late ""Houdini do this, do that"" whereby a middling track escapes the doldrums, the Descendents joke Ariel's fans aren't old enough to get). The tunes are also silly. Singing and arrangements too. Mature my patootie--and that's a good thing.

This convenient best-of goes light on her best and biggest album, Me Myself I, dividing neatly between Steve Lillywhite new wave, which means the drums are loud, and Glyn Johns rock, which means she gets to be loud under her own power. She's a little long-winded, but that's mostly because she puts so much thought into her relationships, which in turn is because she puts so much feeling into them; this is one of those rare pop stars who's invariably serious but never pompous, which is why she isn't a bigger star. The best-of format puts her seriousness in musical perspective--makes it seem almost beautiful sometimes.

Unless you count Amy Grant, pop doesn't get more explicitly Christian--not only does the back cover thank Jesus Christ rather than the usual God, but the record invites us to convert. Granted, Arrington's a Jesse Jackson-type Christian--remembers that petroleum is still a finite resource, takes pains to acknowledge the right to choose in a song where the abortion isn't done. But his positivity theology doesn't sell the music any more than some other ideology would. The music sells the theology, and augments it: for the first time he's making like a songwriter, designing hooks for his vital rhythms, and mellifluous vocal cartoons. The title track lives up to its dreams of Stevie, both songs about babies are choice, and it all comes together with the goofy yet spiritual scat coda to ""Stand With Me (which means stand up for Jesus, children).

Although this crudely hooky three-chord guitar band are working on a concept EP about a Red Brigade spinoff, their debut album is the kind that brooks no follow-up. Beginning with ""Formed a Band"" (""Dye your hair black/Never look back""), it really should end with ""Stand Down"" (""Some of us want to go back to our families"") rather than the one about the 18,000-lira bank robbery. Young love, impotence, older love, charging head down at a stray Matisse, and being bored with the Velvet Underground: this is the stuff of one-shot art-punk. Mike Skinner, meet Eddie Argos--the perfect collaborator, and he'll be looking for work.

Remember how ""Formed a Band"" seemed so conceptual--a joke about an idea for a song? Eddie Argos claims it was autobiographical--claims that Art Brut's entire debut album, created when he was 25, was based on his 17-year-old self. Two years later, he goes on, the more forced-seeming It's a Bit Complicated was based on him at 19, when he must have been pretty dumb around girls. At 29, he doesn't leave himself that out: ""DC comics and chocolate milkshake/Even though I'm 28"" rhymes with ""I guess I'm just developing late."" True, the waiter or delivery man who supposedly sings that song has lacked Argos's career opportunities. But surely it's Argos-the-artist, meaning the man himself, doing a number on U2 in the studio notes ""Slap Dash for No Cash""--""I love the sound of background noise/I want to hear the crack in the singer's voice""--or denying record buyers the vote in ""Demons Out!"" How many great songs about rock and roll can one man write before he gets tiresome? We may find out.

Each side closes with a well-meaning failure: ""Revolutionary Situation""'s collage of indistinct South African voices over Keith LeBlanc humdrum is an object lesson in political correctness that might have made a collectible B, and Bono's country blues is simply ignorant. And now, with my sorehead credentials in order, I'll add that Gil Scott-Heron's superrap is as astute and moving rhythmically as it is ideologically and that Peter Gabriel's largely instrumental ""No More Apartheid"" is a worthy successor to ""Biko."" What's more, each side begins with the title tune, which can grow on you in a big way, although I don't think its failure to break pop is cause for special indignation--had the programmers cooperated, it would have been a case of politics (and hype) overcoming musical taste as much as the opposite. So it goes. As a cultural materialist, I admire Little Steven's strategy anyway--with his medium-saturation outreach, he's preaching to potential faithful, which is always the idea. Sometimes raising consciousness does as much good as raising money. Which can be forwarded to the Africa Fund, 198 Broadway, NYC 10038.

Not only do they sacrifice meaning to sensation, they happily exploit ersatz meaning as a sensation-heightening device. So fine, don't trust them. Only since when is music supposed to be trustworthy? Just note that deprived of genius Trevor Horn these mad studio pros have to go with what they know, subjecting their sound-effects music to hook and beat when no grandiose electronic joke comes to mind.

As performers, these bigtime writer-producers have always struck me as a mite classy--by which I mean rich, among other things. Their genuinely eccentric romanticism only made their ad for the end of the rainbow more insidious, and so my tastes in nouveaux ran more to the showbiz vulgarity of Elton John and James Brown, or the lost-in-a-goldmine inconsistency of Stevie Wonder and John Lennon. Three strained, uneven albums didn't bend me, but Send It put a crimp in my bias, and this one rips it to shreds. It's not the songs per se, although just about every one finds a message in the new black elegance--that material success is good for the soul. It's the vocal detail--very eccentric, very romantic, and convincing both ways.

This couple hit a groove right off and explore it with an internalized virtuosity that seems completely natural, celebrating love over thirty with a compassion and sensuality that makes the smartest disco and cabaret sound shallow.

Always a card, singer-comic-guitarist/banjoist Ashley was still blacking up with the Stanley Brothers in the '40s. He had such a good ear that his 1962 arrangement of the then obscure ""Amazing Grace"" eventually made it the best-known song in America. Well before then, in his thirties, he recorded one of Harry Smith's greatest hits, ""Coo Coo Bird,"" and the rest of these three-minute songs. All are traditional, not to say deliberately archaic, with Ashley's droll musicality shielding them from nostalgia. He believed in entertainment, that was his trade, but not if he had to get mushy about it. Folk music that means to be folk music--as defined, for once, by one of the folk.

I cannot tell a lie. On each side of this record, the composer reads an abstract prose fiction over ""settings for piano and orchestra by `Blue' Gene Tyranny,"" and that's it. The vocal style is a kind of hypnotic singsong; the quiet settings are dominated by piano, tabla, and what sounds like a string synthesizer. I like it more than Discreet Music, less than Another Green World, and about as much as A Rainbow in Curved Air. I suppose I prefer side one, ""The Park,"" because I like the verbal content more, although in fact I perceive the reading as music, just like I'm supposed to, and have never managed to follow the words all the way through. A friend who's done yoga to this record--not an arty type, incidentally--is reminded of going to sleep as a child with adults talking in the next room. Then again, a rather more avant-garde friend who made me turn it off is reminded of the spoilsport who used to read the rosary for five minutes just before his favorite radio program.

Their coterie complains about flat recording and performance, but flatness is of the essence in Western swing, and the sly singing and positively underhanded songwriting here exploit it brilliantly. Beneath their unflappable veneer these country revisionists are seething subversives; it may even be that the protagonist of ""Daddy's Advice"" only plans his little murder to right a case of incest.

I began by wondering what unsuspecting big band had provided the horn riff on ""Am I High?"" and ended by wondering whether they'd made it up themselves, as with so much that is good on this group's most satisfying post-debut. By now the songwriting has become almost straight; you might conceivably find ""Somebody Stole His Body"" on a white gospel album or ""My Baby Think's She's a Train"" on a Sun outtake. The distance that remains comes across as healthy, good-humored respect, especially for banality, which with this band often turns into dumb eloquence, as on the love song ""I Can't Handle It Now.""

Before lo-fi liars convince you to put out a search on Grim, remember that where concept bands are designed to blow up on impact, song bands have a way of, well, improving. Preserved on tape by Afghan Whig John Curley, the music of their normal Middle American freak show--tunes, beat, Chuck Cleaver's anxious falsetto--has gained decisive aural legibility on their major-label sellout, which cost a whopping $2500 to record.

Chuck Cleaver has always been in it for the vignettes--for situations evoked or described in words, pithy words. But as he declares himself a lifer--his first album in four years and fifth overall brings him to age 40--he reveals himself a bandleader. His seasoned rhythm section and strapping guitarist get so far into the guts of the songs you wish they hadn't wasted Electric Rock Music on the last one even though they had a sillier title ready. Cleaver's corkscrew falsetto bores into the high-strung music to transform lots of death and a third nipple into the stuff of noisy desperation, desperate celebration, etc. It's alt-country only insofar as it favors forms and farms. But if shit shovelers can convince Cleaver the cosmos has a niche for him, I'm ready to forgive all the fiddle fills.

Astatke's ""Heliocentrics"" album rules because like most fusioneers he's too interested in upward mobility to state the groove in the vulgar manner of a committed dance musician. But hear enough variations on those fermented Ethiopian scales and you'll learn to savor the piquancy of his voicings. Unlike the purely Addis Ethiopiques 4 collection, which provides eight of these 20 tracks, this overview dips into his montunos and charangas, his flute and steel drum hires, his vibraphone excursions. When I crave those scales straight I may well return to the Abyssinian source. But this is longer--and more flavorsome as well.

The Ethiopia-born and -steeped, U.K.- and Berklee-educated, Harvard- and M.I.T.-associated Astatke is a subtle player on vibes, keyboards and Latin percussion as well as the inventor of something he calls Ethio-jazz. He gets much respect from his largely non-Ethiopian cult, a little less from DJ Shadow drummer Malcolm Catto's band--the Heliocentrics aren't just his sidemen, and thus concoct one of those remarkable collaborations where each party compensates for the other's shortcomings. On his own, Astatke is a mite understated, musicianly and genteel; on their own, the Heliocentrics are just slightly showy, brittle and fickle. Together they play not-quite-Arab Ethiopian scales real loud, juxtapose electric guitar and one-stringed mesenqo, and groove more obstreperously than jazz deems proper. There have been other Euro-Ethio fusions--Le Tigre, Dubulah, in a way Karl Hector. This is the only one that creates a world of its own.

Two hours of live double prove how fulfilling it can be to shovel up behind the elephant. Originals from their mildly likable post-jug catalogue celebrate beer and toking up with your baby in the morning. Tuvan throat tricks augment songs about a CIA agent and the meth-head next door. A few flat old-timey standards leave you grateful to let your mind wander. And weaving the songs together is the patter. Top track: a long, carefully plotted ensemble tale about how their bus lost its brakes just after cresting a hill. ""Amazing Grace"" follows, then Nilsson's ""Think About Your Troubles."" Both sound perfect.

FALSE,A-,The Last Laugh,Asylum Street Spankers,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16651,"
This farewell album from an alt-folk aggregation that never got out of Austin begins so casually and changes up so abruptly it risks disorienting old fans while putting off new ones. Eventually, however, it jazzed me and touched me throughout. It's not just that they dazzle on multiple acoustic instruments while joking around as usual. It's the way Christina Marrs oversings a song worthy of her many passions on the questing ""Ludicrous Heart."" The way third wheel Nevada Newman just figures ""Fuck Work."" And especially the way Charlie King tops an acidly secular ""Don't You Hear Jerusalem Moan"" (""The Catholic preacher makes a lot of noise / He's down in the rectory altering the boys"") with the unabashed sentiment of ""Savor Every Day"": ""I had this real good friend of mine / He told me, Charlie, I may not be here for a long time / But I am here for a good time / I sure miss that friend of mine.""

Was (Not Was) repay Atkinson for his vocal chores by producing a solo debut, and spare us D. Was's bug-eyed late-capitalist existential cynicism in the bargain. Trouper that he is, Atkinson will sing any nonsense they hand him, but he obviously finds his truth in Dionne Warwick, the Tymes, General Johnson, and Eddie Rabbitt, and I'll go along with that. Meanwhile, the Was Bros. have learned enough about Linn drums to provide the kind of bug-eyed late-capitalist existential displacement that lends realism to orders like ""dig deep, don't be nice"" and ""dance or die.""

FALSE,A-,Gedida,Natacha Atlas,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2506,"
Although production is credited as usual to Transglobal Underground, bassist Count Dubulah has  departed, and so has keybman Alex Kasiek--unless he also goes by the name Tim  Whelan, as some suggest.  In any case, the music has morphed so that it now bears in on the always-dominant Middle Eastern pop aspect  of Atlas's mystery-laden  Belgian-Arab-Asian-Jewish persona. It's good riddance  to the multicultural kitchen sink--bhangra rappers, hyped-up electropercussion, metaphysical atmospherics, long slow Arabic meditations on I could never care what. Instead we get a probably shallow and definitely delightful piece of exotica--ouds and hand drums and Cairo strings, tunes that hold your ear until the next one begins, perky tempos that always convey good cheer as they reduce  passion to a trope. Unless your idea of magic is to switch to English and presto change-o turn into Bjï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ make belly dancing look like a  lesson in self-determination.

Although in other manifestations crew chief Slug can get ill, this one-disc double-EP collects the thoughts of an alt-rap everyman. Brooding through the long days on caffeine, nicotine, gasoline, and Ant's looped, retarded samples, the voice evokes Will Smith sans Bel Air--the Depressed Prince of South Minneapolis, clueless in his latest scrape. But Slug understands women better than most male losers, and maintains a winner's enthusiasm for his own talent. Inspirational Verse: ""Some got pencils and some got guns/Some know how to stand and some of 'em run/We don't all get along but we sing the same songs/Party for the fight to write.""

FALSE,A-,God Loves Ugly,Atmosphere,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11326,"
Slug is hip hop's finest poet of everyday life because he's come to terms with moderate success, the amenity that affords him opportunity to look around.  Neither resentful nor driven, he doesn't feel sorry for himself, doesn't overrate himself, doesn't think the world owes him a promotion budget. Metaphoric tough talk aside, he doesn't bitch about r&amp;b or bling, either; sure he wants more, but he's got too much pride and too much self-knowledge to waste emotion blaming the system. His one obsession is unrequited love, which he analyzes with such thoughtless candor and penetrating introspection that I not only believe the someone exists, I think it's possible her name's really Lucy. He raps like a man thinking, over strong, simple beats that put his thoughts in order and his body in gear. If Lucy says he's ugly, he's too good for her.

Rarely has such a modest record been so in-your-face about it.

I also believe that as he ""write[s] it all down before it vanishes,"" he feels ""Fortunate"" to make music from his words and a living at it too. For CD purchasers only: a portfolio of proudly unpretentious architectural photographs documenting the workaday housing stock of his mixed Minneapolis hood.

What ever are they emoting about? Doesn't much matter. In one song I especially like, wordy low-life vignettes (pimps, polyester, paramedics; defected, excommunicated, subverted) are revved by simultaneous guitar chime and guitar noise that gives way to a sweet refrain of ""Dancing on the corpse's ashes,"" which is subsumed in turn by a raucous chorus with a wishing well in it. Passion in El Paso is what all this comes down to, and fleshed out with comparable sonics and shaped into associatively elongated songforms, that's enough. In a bad time for young guitar bands, including many barely forgettable ones lumped under the trade name ""emo,"" these ambitious yowlers are reason for hope. For four consecutive CDs they've developed, developed, developed. Not only do they believe, they can back it up.

Not much, but as near to resolution as any Palestinian is liable to get right now. Recorded in London. Tell Tony Blair the news.

A hip-hop band, only not funky like Stetsasonic and the Roots. Or then again, a rap-rock band, only not heavy like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park. White, I assume--I'm positive about the rapper, who I met before he became an alienated teenager, and Jewish names predominate among his bandmates. The DFA production is enhancement only--the music is Automato's. Less accomplished and sensational than the Rapture's, it's a lot trippier when it comes together and also when it threatens to jump the tracks, both of which happen plenty. Usually the chapstick-packing rapper figures out what to do with it, t""All I ever wanted was truth, peace, harmony, and anti-gravitational boots,"" he confides, only then: ""Truth is a bitch when you're living in sin."" So be glad he got the boots.

These lyrics aren't banal, just plain-spoken (my favorite: ""Keepin' It to Myself""), and in any case the passionate expertness of the vocal mix (like the Rascals, only the Rascals were never this tight), combined with a motion more Brownian than most black groups can manage, more than makes up.

These formerly acoustic Carolinians say they won a fan base by cutting their chests open. They go on to report that then they cut their hair--and bought a ticket to the big time, where with production from Rick Rubin they put all the above figures of speech into a song too catchy for their fan base, one of a solid half dozen on this typically thought through, atypically slammed home tribute to ""I"" and ""love"" and definitely ""you."" Sure there are drums. But mostly it's the tunes that do the slamming.

The hooks pop-rap lives off abound, and the cameos are essential because that's what they're here for, adding a measure of soul or power or fetching melody Iggy herself doesn't have in her. That's demonstrably true right now--line the seven bonus tracks that fill out the useless Reclassified repackage all in a row and you still won't have a decent EP--and might be true forever. Doesn't matter, because as a pop album this tops Ariana's, Sia's, dare I say it Taylor's, even Nicki's. What's more, it's Iggy herself whose striving Australian-Atlantan cadence puts every song across. Hooks you can hire easy these days. Originality you can't. And as Elvis Presley told Marion Keisker sixty years ago, she don't sound like nobody.

A Paris-based Syrian sets poems to Arab psaltery, Arab flute, Arab percussion, and Arab-style synthesizer. They'll stop you short the minute they come on, but translations or no they background better than they foreground: at its grandest, the music's world-exotic aura is not without faint echoes of Vangelis. Because it's text-driven, however, it never accrues the emotional mass of true schlock. With a culture being devastated, heightened emotion seems not only permissible but just.

FALSE,A-,"High Land, Hard Rain",Aztec Camera,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=197,"
At first I did the obvious thing and pigeonholed this as high-grade pop--richer and truer than Haircut 100 or even the dB's or the Bongos and ultimately feckless anyhow. Now I think it's more like U2 with songs (which is all U2 needs). For sheer composition--not just good tunes, but good tunes that swoop and chime and give you goosebumps--Roddy Frame's only current competition is Marshall Crenshaw, and unlike Crenshaw he never makes you smell retro. His wordcraft is worthy of someone who admires Keats, his wordplay worthy of someone admired by Elvis C.; he sings and arranges with a rousing lyricism that melds militance and the love of life. These are songs in which sweet retreat can't be permanent, in which idealism is buffeted but unbowed--songs of that rare kind of innocence that has survived hard experience. So far, anyway--Frame is still very young. How unusual it is these days for youth to add resonance to what used to be teen music.

Not only is this Roddy Frame's solo debut in disguise, it's the worst kind of solo debut, replete with electronic everything and hacks/pros like Marcus Miller and Tommy LiPuma. Yet even after three straight slow ones on side two, the kid is putting over his own style of hit-factory romance the way he once put over his own style of schoolboy verse. The voice still gives off that sincere ache. And strummed or picked, the guitar lifts off every time.

Ahh, sampling--it'll turn a minimalist into a melodist every time. If like me you've found their Brownian motion grooveful but a touch austere, maybe you'll get hooked by the obscure Arabian-nights snatches (first a snatch of the snatch, then finally completion), or the girls (speeded-up guys?) singing (this can't be, beatmasters please advise) ""You're so stupid, you're so rough."" Or the symphonic intro. Or maybe Rakim's ever-increasing words-per-minute ratio--the man loves language like a young Bob D. Beatmaster's P.S.: It's the fucking Eagles, speeded up, singing ""You're so smooth, the world's so rough.""

Like every rapper, Rakim boasts: ""I'm pushin' power that's punishin'/Prepare to be a prisoner/The hit man is the/Brother with the charisma."" But he never brags. Even at warp speed, as in the title track where the four seconds just quoted can be found if you listen up, he's always calm, confident, clear. On their third album, as on their phase-shifting 1986 debut, Eric B.'s samples truly are beats, designed to accentuate the natural music of an idealized black man's voice: it's Rakim's rhythm that hits us. Whether we find that disquieting or reassuring depends on what we were scared of going in.

Rakim didn't really frag that general in Iraq--wasn't even there. He's just trafficking in the metaphors nightmares are made of, exploiting the interface between horror movies and the postmodern imagination. Putting it literally: ""My intellect wrecks and disconnects/Your cerebral cortex/Your cerebellum is next."" And metaphorically: ""I took a kid and cut off his eyelids/Killing him slow so he could see what I did/And if he don't understand what I said/I push in his eyeballs way to the back of his head/So he could see what he's getting into/A part of the mind that he's never been to."" As for the star of the show, Rakim calls Eric B.'s new groove--a jazzy minimalist funk trailing uncentered horn hooks--relaxing with pep. When he hits it right, it's like the mouth you love doing the spot you forgot.

Softly, cornily, oh so subtly, Kenny Edmonds hangs real songs off the big pop statement new jack pretenders pretend to. Playing a woman-loving, male-proud guy with ordinary domestic problems, pressing romantic emotions, and infinite sexual patience, he remains alive to black achievement and black pain--you think he doesn't know what it signifies when he runs the elegant ""All Day Thinkin'"" off hip-hop shading and the Ebonic ""be""? Deploying Eric Clapton, L.L. Cool J, Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, and Kenny G, dipping his well-mannered falsetto into a growl on ""I will be down"" or marshalling dulcet studio rats for a tribute to the golden age of postdoowop, the man is in such command it may take you half a dozen plays to notice.

Forget R. Kelly if you can get him to bug off already--when it all comes down, Kenny Edmonds will be remembered as the most interesting love man of our era. Only females of a certain mindset can be expected to sit still for all his palaver, but he's got a hell of a line. Duplicating but three tracks from his superb worstseller The Day, this is the distillation of woman-friendly romanticism; there's even a song that accurately and effectively deploys the jargon term ""abused."" The new one he didn't write advances instantly to the head of his repertoire: ""Poured one for you but I drank that too,"" laments the bereaved wino-in-progress. The new one he did write lacks a killer hook. But is it ever outspoken about fortysomething males who leave their wives primping at home.

Five years ago his best album exploited his superstar connections with cameos from Stevie, Mariah, Kenny G. Here he updates on a new label newly headed by his old partner with coproductions utilizing the Neptunes, Tim &amp; Bob, Heavy D. Beat mechanics don't guarantee a thing, of course. But for all his platinum balladry, Kenny Edmonds has been funky on demand since the Deele, and the showcase tracks up front are as tricky as any to surface all year--just when you think you've balanced all five or six elements in your mind's ear, up pops number six or seven. He leaves the tricks behind eventually, if only so as not to alienate his normal market share, and after bottoming out briefly returns with enough ballads to make you stop humming ""What If"" until it goes platinum.

People put up with Pete Doherty because he's capable of melodies so endearing that his beleaguered band falls into place around them. Then he falls down on top of the band. I know nothing about what drugs he took here and oppose them pre-emptively anyway. But claiming there's no music on his best album since the Libertines' debut would just be a lie. Seems wispy until you concentrate because--unlike that debut, which it otherwise resembles--there's no punk propulsion to power the music over its own vagaries. But once again its vagaries are its distinction. Doherty makes a case for flat-on-your-ass alienation in an insane wartime culture. But please, don't go out with him. Kate Moss can fend for herself.

I'm not claiming I would have gotten the message without a 13-year-old I know broadcasting it from her boombox. But keynoted by two guaranteed pop classics, one dance and one heart, this is genius teensploitation. I give half credit to songwriter-svengali Max Martin, who's put in time with Ace of Base. But as someone who still suspects Abba were androids, I award the other half to the Boys, without whose sincere if not soulful simulations of soul and sincerity Martin's slow ones would be as sickening as any other promise that's made to be broken. Together the team manufactures a juicy sexual fantasy for virgins who get nervous when performers grab their dicks and think it's gross when teenage ignoramuses copy the move. They deserve one.

Interrupting a catalogue that's essentially an ongoing autobiography to preach to the disenfranchised in the year of the coup, it makes sense for Flatbush's finest to reverse the normal hip-hop sequencing strategy of starting raw and sneaking in anything soft or conscious at the end. The first half here starts almost sweet, cushioning such messages as ""In the land of the free it's full of freeloaders / Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors"" but also ""Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful"" with crooning, chorales, r&amp;b grooves. Still, I get happier myself when six street-flavored tracks toughen the second half up and cameos change it up: guttural Meechy Darko, Chronixx representing for Ethiopia, Schoolboy Q leaving his penis out of this. And real-versus-fake brags are beyond tired, a rhymer this literate has a right to go after the ""ad lib rapping"" of Soundcloud freestylers, especially while scoring points like ""I need dead presidents to represent me / Cause I never knew a live one that represent me"" and ""Nowadays they hangin' us by a different tree / Branches of the government / I can name all three.""

On the page, ""You left your shoes in the tree with me/I'll wear them to your house tonight"" looks hopelessly stupid; on record, it's quite wry. Nor is he undemonstrative--unlike low-affect codependent Elliott Smith, he fusses so much over his tunes, crooning and segueing and arranging and stuff, that you know he loves them to death.

""How can I give you the answers you need/When all I possess is a melody?"" he implores, and for once said melody is the answer. It's the rare guitar geek who acts like strings and horns are where he's always belonged rather than where he hopes he'll fit in. The rare bedroom genius who's cheered by success, too.

Like a less musicianly version of the departed TSOL, this promising L.A. hardcore outfit has moved on to slower-tempo, organ-drenched hard rock that resembles nothing so much as late Hawkwind. Some may call it caterwaul, but I find myself moved by its anthemic ambition--and achievement. Conceptual clincher: the way they surround the dystopian-gothic tales and images--the kind of stuff that comes naturally to committed teenagers who know they're growing up but don't know they like it--with ""It's Only Over . . ."" and "". . .

No doubt a better writer would find a simpler, more eloquent way to say, for instance, ""Culture was the seed of proliferation/but it has gotten melded/into an inharmonic whole."" But a) the song bashes like a motherfucker anyway. And b) the big words are a hook. If their antipolitical ecopessimism isn't spreading like wildfire, which is just as well anyway, give them credit for aiming to challenge, not convince. And believe that where most bands with a message for the masses wind up looking like bigger fools than they already are, Ph.D candidate Greg Graffin and departed homeboy Brett Gurewitz aren't just better informed than their fans--they're probably better informed than you.

Because Marshall Tito's Yugoslavia encouraged more recording than madman Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania, this Serbian icon has a catalogue that awaits compilation. But just in case his master recordings proved casualties of war, in 1999 some culturally enlightened Dutchmen had him reprise a few hits. Roughened by 63 years of hard living, Bajramovic's voice has lost glide and thrust here, but even in his wild youth he was no breast-beater--his persona was unruly, his manner suave.

He leaves Texas to consult a Pakistani psychic on the Lower East side. He chronicles a rich kid who gets away with killing a girl in an auto accident he spends the rest of his life drinking about. He relives Macu Picchu once again.

But still--there's a hole in her robe, she falls asleep to the TV, and she still hears her mother saying ""don't give me that face any more."" Baker's voice is no prettier, but his music is less rough-hewn--here cello, brushes, and Leonard Cohen harmonies, there Gurf Morlix's blues-tango guitar. And the literary ambitions are out front--the way ""feast"" rhymes with ""rough beast,"" the Emily Dickinson quote he sneaks into ""Road Crew,"" the Jimmy Cagney mythos that falls flat as such ideas sometimes do. The third-happiest song is ""Ditch"": ""My crazy-ass wife/nutty as her brother/supposed to marry rich/according to her mother.""

This Dakar star is a 36-year-old Fouladou from the Casamance region south of Gambia, the cultural complexity of which is said to be why his band includes classically trained Belgian bigshots on violin and accordion. But if the explanation is glib, the results aren't. The groove and ambience are West African with European shading--not Portuguese as history would suggest, but Balkan, probably an accident rather than an influence, though in the melting pot that is the continent that invented imperialism, who knows? Lithe, warm, changeable, distinct, Balde's voice arouses hope, and in time the arrangements claim attention even when the tunes don't grab it. With so much of the best nonarchival Afropop dependent on known quantities or brave new genre experiments, he has a shot at becoming a known quantity himself.

The sex-positive young Dirty South battle rapper makes sure you know this is her pop move with a title search engines consider a typo. By pop she means vulnerable, sometimes playful, sometimes even loony-toony, with emo-ish lyrics in the manner of the simultaneously pained and drawled ""You got me feeling so lost/Sitting out here solo/Keep checking my phone."" Both her musical execution and her marketing strategy favor a beguilingly silly charm. The hookfest begins with the aptly entitled ""Introduction"": squelchy three-note synth hook over and over under lyrics that begin ""Ha, ha, ha/Mwah!/I said 'Hi, it's nice to meetcha.'""

A Hungarian-born Squat Theatre alumna who once upon a time landed a money gig playing Louis C.K.'s love interest emanates the flintiest songs of 2015. A son is killed after his mother curses out his guards. The fun of tonighting it is over by 2 a.m. but tonight isn't. A mother calls her daughter at 3 AM and can't think of anything to say.

Former Gogol Bordello horn man Ori Kaplan moves in with Big Lazy's Tamir Muskat, the Israeli-born drummer who faced down Gypsy punk Eugene Hutz in J.U.F. last year. Everything else is friends and programming, with a party feel more relaxed than expected despite the fact that their CVs assuredly include weddings. The drumbeats remain edgily electronic. But the bass lines propelling the dance, and the horns and vocals flavoring it, are sweeter than in Gogol Bordello or Big Lazy--with a discernible sensuality putting flesh on the fun. Ethnically, and politically, the idea is that Morocco and Bulgaria are one place--a lie longing to become a dream.

Instrumentals called ""Kabulectro"" and ""Balcumbia"" triangulate their ambitions. There's live Gypsy brass and fabricated Gypsy brass. There's an anti-racist reggae and an anti-gun reggae and one called ""Buhala"" that's haunted by chants from some souk at the end of the unmarked road.

Lou Ann Barton, a professional tramp who's done her share of rehab, and Angela Strehli, a sensible sort who runs the label, must have figured it would be neighborly to help their old pal turn in a decent followup to Soulful Dress, which is eight years old now. Sure they did--they love each other like Ike and Tina, whose ""A Fool in Love"" they covered to initiate this mission impossible in 1985. Congratulations to coordinator-bassist Sarah Brown for getting a record out of them, and to producer-pianist Dr. John for easing it up toward the sum of its parts.

Doing my due diligence, I bought the easier-to-find 2005 King iteration of this canonical comp, All 20 of Their Chart Hits. But though you may have to settle for it, I'm glad I don't. I prefer the dance novelties (best: the stepping-in-space ""The Float,"" complete with wobbly out-of-phase backup) with which it replaces Rhino's r&amp;b marginalia (best: the Marty Robbins tune ""Sugaree""), but the sound is tinnier and the annotation nonexistent all the way down to the composer credits. The 15 songs the two share are the nub of Ballard's achievement not counting ""How You Gonna Get Respect (If You Haven't Cut Your Process Yet)."" That the man who had hits with ""Work With Me Annie"" and ""Annie Had a Baby"" also had hits with ""The Twist"" and ""Finger Poppin' Time"" (and wrote three of them) is all you need know of the breadth of his vision. Ballard's businesslike determination to create a disturbance in your equilibrium never slackens. He's disruptive in a way most quality r&amp;b is too focused on music per se to have time for.

Before there was a Rail Band, this nobly born singer-trumpeter-flutist led a dance troupe and a musical ensemble in the provincial Malian city of Mopti.

What's the name of this nation? Zulu, Zulu. I've never loved electro like Bam the Prophet and miss J. Lydon's ""World Destruction,"" but here at the irreducible least are two of the greatest records of the '80s. The 1982 Arthur Baker space jam ""Looking for the Perfect Beat"" you know: synth figures and drum rumbles and startling scratches echoing a hooky title cadence that's varied and layered around everyday rapping--rapping that finds all the earth it needs in the patch of grass outside the rec room. Cosmic Force's ""Zulu Nation Throwdown"" you've maybe read about: floating over its clattering trap set and nothing-but-a-disco rhyme-trading on Lisa Lee's spunky minute of fame, it defines the inspired innocence of first-generation old-school and allows me to retire the 1980 Paul Winley 12-inch that's been my most-played vinyl since I went digital. Cosmic Force disappeared posthaste, replaced by the likable Soul Sonic Force, who pass the mic on tracks that range from competent to classic and invite James Brown and Melle Mel to the party. But I'll never forget ""These are the devastating words that you never heard before/I'm Lisa Lee, huh/I got rhymes galore/So young ladies out there and from the heavens above . . .

In retrospect, the sheer dumb catchiness of the Kraftwerk hook sweetens one's love-feh relationship with the title tune, and the way ""Lookin' for the Perfect Beat"" digests, funkifies, and elaborates the winning earnestness of ""Planet Rock""'s technofuturism was electrohop's transcendent moment. With the ambitious but unconvincing ""Renegades of Funk"" filling out side one, you'd figure this for a convenient way to store two classics. But though side two does skip both Bam-Brown's ""Unity"" and Bam-Rotten's ""World Destruction"" (because neither bear the Soulsonic Force name, I suppose), two of the previously unreleased tracks are anything but filler. And while one features Melle Mel/Doug Wimbish and the other Trouble Funk, nobody ever said Bam doesn't need help, least of all Bam--there isn't a more public-spirited natural leader on the frenetically competitive rap scene. Which is probably why his groups avoid the male-bonded braggadocio that supplies so much of rap's emotional energy.

I like these songs when they're good. But they misrepresent him--the cheated-upon protagonist of ""The Biggest Airport in the World"" is naive, which misses Bandy's point completely. This compiles eight GRC hits (including the above-named anomalies) and the two CBS songs I've mentioned. It's an unusually solid country LP, and the GRC albums are all out of print anyway.

But the value of these songs isn't merely negative--they're thoroughly realized in both the writing and playing. Though the style is as derivative and even retro as on EP, they don't seem to be dabbling any more.

Catchier cut for cut than All Over the Place, this is also the sad testament of good girls gone bad in the El Lay moneypits. Launched by Susanna Hoffs's and Vicki Peterson's ""Hero Takes a Fall,"" ""Going Down to Liverpool"" to ""Manic Monday"" to ""If She Knew What She Wants"" to ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" is one of those euphoric pop sequences that makes you believe this can go on forever--this happiness, this knowledge, this being 26, this crest of the wave. Problem is, they didn't write a one of those songs. Culled for dross, the self-penned stuff that follows reaches with some success for the mature self-awareness that is the current El Lay currency, and not a one sounds as fresh or as wise as Paul Simon's ""Hazy Shade of Winter.""

The problem with the original was that it had a bit too much going on melodically and structurally to minimalize down into a synthesizer, especially one that wasn't pretending to be anything else. Here the piano-clarinet-cello-guitar-bass-percussion ensemble pretends to be a synthesizer. And although I pray postdance knob-twisters don't fall for the Gregorian goo-goo girls who douse ""1/2"" with blancmange, the lovely textures will make them drool. Or anyway, sweat. Perspire. Exude.

Although only percussionist Steven Schick admits to actually banging on anything, I swear the making of the first two of these five compositions, especially Arnold Dreyblatt's galvanically funky ""Escalator,"" is the live drumming, programmed drumming, and/or divine clatter. After that, as so often with rock-allied downtowners who decline repetition, it's down to texture, only these textures have content. Not only can one live with 16 tonally unstable minutes of a Glenn Branca who has cast off his delusions of grandeur, but Phil Kline's ""Exquisite Corpses"" risks both program music, which he acknowledges, and melody, which he doesn't.

In the '60s I loved Riley's gamelan-like semipop breakthrough A Rainbow in Curved Air, dismissing this earlier composition as too tinkly. Since the trippy minimalist lets players determine their own volume and duration, maybe the vibraphone and marimba guys were on the wrong drugs. Thirty-five years later, overall register has dropped, the music signifying loud and electric with comparable instrumentation. The moment that gets me every time comes 15 minutes in, when the cello surges to the front with the force of a Jimmy Page solo--relative force, that is.

Kyaw Kyaw Naing is a virtuoso percussionist from a Burmese family so distinguished that the last Burmese ensemble to play New York before his own, back in 1975, was led by his father. Myanmar being a very special military dictatorship, Kyaw Kyaw Naing now lives in Sunnyside, and his first recording with Western musicians is the best kind of fusion--our guys trying to execute his scales, melodies, and structures rather than him trying to adapt. The result is brighter and livelier than most of the indigenous Asian stuff I hear. Though it's chamber music rather than any kind of pop or jazz, it's more accessible and enjoyable than any similarly sourced Rough Guide or Sublime Frequencies comp. Inauthenticity rools.

Even if you find the male voice dancehall has unleashed on the world as incomprehensible in its brawny macho as in its machine-gun patois, the way it embraces contradictions of pride and arrogance, class and gender, strength and menace ends up being more original, powerful, and distinctive than the beats it rode in on. Banton's gay-bashing ""Boom Bye-Bye"" remains one of that voice's vilest moments. But nobody out there commands a huger growl--Buju could whisper sweet nothings to the World Bank and be a hero by force of physical endowment alone. So I'm grateful for the maturity he vaunts at 23. There is one about the size of his other physical endowment, which he hooks to Maurice Williams's ""Stay"" just in case. But let the guy have his fun. He can carry a tune, pick a hook, choose a collaborator (a few more cameos like this and the whole world will mourn Garnett Silk). And everywhere else here he articulates empathy, vulnerability, and concern, personalizing and politicizing a style of conscience that comes naturally to the 15th child of a Maroon family. The most fully accomplished reggae album since the prime of Black Uhuru.

This starts out in the heights of ""Hills and Valleys,"" an affirmation of Rasta community which adds to the deep soul of ""'Til Shiloh"" a melody that is hope itself. After that shoo-in for the reggae canon, the album can only descend, and while Banton's voice remains the essence of dancehall and the tracks are well-conceived--strong rhythms, welcome guests, thought-through principles, the nice touch of ""Small Axe""--it soon appears that PolyGram 86ed the flagship act of banished troublemaker Lisa Cortes on practical grounds: by pop standards the vehicle seems high-generic. But the last five songs suggest that spite was at work. Suddenly the music zooms upward from its pleasant plateau, spooky bouncing bass and twisty guitar stile and intense Toots remake with the man himself chanting ""I say yeah"" and ""54-46"" like prison was yesterday, all culminating in the voice-only social-determinism tract ""Circumstances,"" a heartening bit of analysis from a man who 45 minutes earlier was claiming his ""Destiny"" far less convincingly.

Unpretentious but not unsophisticated, Barker's light, unslurred mezzo was admired by none other than fellow non-belter Billie Holiday. Often backed by New York pros more understated than their counterparts back in New Orleans, she's slyer than a first listen suggests--give her some time and her originality will stand there hands on hips until you notice. Unlike Holiday, Barker wrote a lot of her own material, but she also knew when Andy Razaf or Lil Hardin came up with a good one. She's too wise for you to jive, and you're too dumb to realize.

But Barman's not just a clever twerp with an interest in literature. In fact, he's kind of a nice guy. Listen a little and you'll hear a contemptuous dismissal of Ritalin and the testing-service torture device called the DBQ, a defense of p.c. that invites the world to tzuck his tzadik, and two fond memories of an anarchist bookstore.

Shored up by the respect and occasional beats of ?uestlove, MF Doom, and his old pal Prince Paul, he's sometimes hysterical, sometimes caring, and sometimes both.

Cheeky title notwithstanding, Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit. didn't just sit. It was an album where a band powered up at just the moment its singer evolved into a guitarist to reckon with as she came up with the best-observed lyrics of her life. Three years later, what little observation there is peers inward--half the songs sound written in a flat she hasn't left in a week. If anything, the band is sharper. But rather than a singer dynamic enough to match it, we get a dynamic guitarist who also happens to be the sole lyricist and solo singer. So be grateful for the Margaret Atwood lift ""I wanna walk through the park in the dark / Men are scared that women will laugh at them / I wanna walk through the park in the dark / Women are scared that men will kill them,"" especially for sparking the crucial add-on ""I hold my keys between my fingers.""

The main thing her critics'-choice debut proved was that when you put a good young singer up against a bunch of Kostas songs, the Kostas songs win. Not that this 23-year-old Patsy Cline fan is any less produced or conceptualized here--more so, actually. But the conceptualization is so audacious, and so perfectly suited to her timbre and swing, that it's more fun than what it rips off, by which I mean countrypolitan. The strings, the prefab licks, the rinky-dink beats, the hooks with exclamation points on them, the background singers going woo-oo-oo and whoa-oh--everything the late Owen Bradley did for and to country music is here, with Owen himself overseeing four tracks and his brother-partner Harold following his notes on the rest. Yet Barnett has these wonderful pipes, and not only does she sing as if she loves the songs, she sings as if she can scarcely contain her warm fuzzy feelings for the style itself. My fave is ""Trademark,"" originally a c&amp;w No. 2 for the forgotten hit machine Carl Smith in 1952. But the new-growth corn tastes just as good with a coating of caramel.

I doubt Barnett conceives this strange little album as a rebuke to the reverent high musicianship of the Patsy Cline interpretations she made her bread and butter long before 2011's Sweet Dreams. High musicianship with a gourmet flourish is what she does. But there's a savor in hearing it applied to this potpourri of humble deep-pop obscurities--late Connie Francis, later Sonny and Cher, lost girl-group and guy-group keepers by Mable John and the Tams--garnished with newer art-pop obscurities. For me the clincher is ""The Fool,"" a top-10 one-shot for 21-year-old Sanford Clark that I thought I hadn't heard since 1956 until I found out there are karaoke versions.

In addition to the flabby ""Extra Inning of Love,"" which I bet is soft two ways, these tend to be about the good guys--Dale Murphy, Bernie Williams, even Babe Ruth, whose personal failings are swallowed up, as the lyric argues, by the size of his myth. Unfortunately, even Henry Aaron's career-long battle with racism doesn't make as good a story here as Lenny Dykstra's hustles or Alex Rodriguez's conceit or Dock Ellis's headhunting or Larry Yount's failure, and when Scott McCaughey croons it only makes things softer. But the songs about fandom--""Stats"" and ""The Baseball Card Song,"" the devotional ""Box Scores"" and encyclopedic ""They Played Baseball""--suit a band of also-rans old enough to treasure their own fans' rooting interest. And note that none of the five is an Oakland A's devotee. I'm not either, but Billy Beane was right, and not exactly for the first time, to make their celebration of his franchise the team song. Real fans knew what a great story that team was long before they made a movie out of it.

Still, no catchier collection of jingles has come to my attention since Steve Miller made his mint off jet airliners. So though I know it's dance music, that's not how I hear it.

Lisbon-based, Angola-born DJ-beatmaker Pedro Coquenao had made a project of melding bassy modern electrobeats with the older Angolan pop that, just ask Angola-born Sam Mangwana, is close kin to the older pop generated in Kinshasa 350 miles north. So my first thought was soukous update. But in fact guitars are sparse. Instead Coquenao updates kudoro, tr. ""hard-ass,"" an Angolan electro that pushes the beats way forward the way soca does in Trinidad. Because his tastes in this dance music run melodic, however, the update is retro-nuevo in flavor. And his thing for strong lyrics makes a difference vocally and texturally whether you know the language or not.

Up against the Clean and the Chills, to whom they bear a strong, witting family resemblance, these New Zealanders are lightweights, which is saying something. Their mild anxieties, while explicit enough if you listen with care, provide only subliminal content, serving mainly as insurance that they don't turn into anyone's new Beach Boys. Some differentiate their albums by rhythmic intensity, but this career selection homes in on their essence: wispy tune buoying flat drone.

Take the title literally. The prospect of touring having proved too much for leader-keyboardist Tyondai Braxton, out go the castrati choruses, the precision interlocks, the neatness that is the curse of math-rock. Instead, general pitch levels drop while the drums explode. ""Like a car wreck, only in tune,"" I heard one guy puzzle as he left a show that revved up all the consequent incommensurabilities even further. So much better than a Ferrari that never needs a tune-up, muse I. In the studio they're less accident prone, and they still tintinnabulate some. But now they also grunt.

Long criticized for the newly minted sin of doubt by born-again Pedro the Lion fans as obsessed with purity as their secular indie-rock brethren and sistern, the former Christian artist takes his faith seriously enough to embrace skepticism straight up. Plodding for clarity's sake like he's gotten the gospel from James McMurtry, he debates a God he's no longer sure exists as he details the suffering he's pondered, observed, and caused. His salvation is humanistic empathy, spiritual complexity, and melodies more unfailing than back when the Holy Ghost was inspiring into his ear. Credo: ""It's hard to be, it's hard to be, hard to be a decent human being.""

The medium-honest sensibility is a little more personal now, soulful in its Waspy way. Maybe they weren't really surfers or hot rodders, but they were really Southern Californians, and that's what their music was about. It still is, too, only now they sing about water, broken marriages, and the love of life. Still a lot of fun, too.

Since Victoria Legrand is from France, figure the beach house belongs to Alex Scally's parents--a safe haven of keepsakes and used furniture, a temporary site that leaves a person free to laze and dream, kind of like youth in the old days. In 2010 the duo's Teen Dream clarified their tunes and expressed their personal confusion in bad poetry. But though this sounds similar at a distance, in fact it's quite distinct, cultivating a gauziness that intensifies their lo-fi while keeping the imagery plain if not always straightforward. Verbally, both albums play the dark card, only now Legrand's anxiety is existential and universal--""Wouldn't you like to know how far you've got to go,"" ""The voices in the hall/Will carry on their talking."" The simple, deliberate chords and anthemic repetitions that give the anxiety form would be damn pretty at a minimum if she was counting seashells. Countering the depressive undertow, that form is both a spiritual triumph and the aural equivalent of Jesus and Mary Chain frosting a birthday cake.

Another you-gotta-believe record, just like Check Your Head--only less so, thank God, whose appearances herein are frequent and auspicious. Although once again it's short on dynamite, at least it starts with a bang. Two bangs, actually, one hip hop and one hardcore--their loyalty to their roots closely resembles an enlightened acceptance of their limitations. With each boy having evolved into his own particular man, the rhymes are rich and the synthesis is complex. You-gotta-love the way the ecological paean/threnody emits from a machine that crosses a vocoder and the p.a. at a taco drive-through, but their collective spiritual gains peak in the instrumentals, which instead of tripping up the Meters evoke the unschooled funk of a prerap garage band. If they've never run across Mer-Da's Long Burn the Fire, on Janus, maybe I could tape them one?

Simultaneously overconfident and generous as usual, this asynchronously omnivorous package has all the hits, only there aren't that many, so 16 of 42 tracks are ""rarities."" In their opinion, that doesn't include the revelating early single ""She's On It"" or the fine late B side ""Skills To Pay the Bills."" It does include Fatboy Slim's ""Body Movin' "" remix, which is as much fun as ""Fight for Your Right,"" which they apologize for, although they're proud to debut ""Boomin' Granny,"" which puts moves on a ""sassy, sophisticated, sexy"" 80-year-old in the checkout line (hey, that's my mama--and the song's nice in an offensive sort of way, their calling card). Of course, their rarities can be as flat as anybody else's, as can their showcases, like the Latin-funk ""Sabrosa"" on its third go-round. Still rappers and rockers, still wise guys seeking wisdom, they'll try anything twice and convince half their many fans to like it, usually to the benefit of said fans if not musical history.

As much as Jay-Z, and with more jokes, the Beasties are masters of their sound, of which this is the old-school variant. Like the Catskill shticksters they honor, they crack wise as naturally as John Hurt drawled, only with a better sense of rhythm (than the shticksters).

More light-hearted than their Gotham-cheering album of 2004, and if you think light-hearted means shallow--especially for a rapper with a tumor threatening his salivary glands at age 42, which was where MCA found himself last July--you've come to the wrong art form. With a push from Nas and a whoosh from Santigold and new life from their chorusing kids, the beats spritz and submarine in signature Beasties style as the rhymes claim contexts high-living and low-life.

Their assurance and wit would be the envy of veteran rock and rollers, and though this is a little lightweight, it makes up in charm what it lacks in dramatic brilliance. Even when the arrangements get tricky--""Let It Be"" is a touch too ornate in this version--their spontaneity of impulse comes through. And while fave rave ""One After 909"" is pure teen simplicity, it sounds no fresher than ""Two of Us,"" an adult song about couple bonding that I hope applies to their songwriting duo. The one mistake is ""The Long and Winding Road,"" sunk in a slush of strings worthy of its shapeless philosophizing. But even the great are allowed to falter now and then.

Struck by this Oakland trio's tenth-anniversary album, which was released shortly before Donald Trump killed Leonard Cohen in 2016, I delayed coverage because I hadn't given them a thought since 2008's Collide and also because I got distracted. I hope they're working on the next one as I write. But I can finally attest that if you're buzzed by the idea of Middle East dub rendered vaster by the complementary miracles of data storage and guest cameos, this is where to start and you're unlikely to need a whole lot more. Simultaneously atmospheric and detailed, abstract and groovalicious, it makes the case for international understanding while limiting its lyrical content to a distorted chant called ""Vendetta,"" a defense of a 17-year-old murderer, something in Japanese called ""Three Sisters,"" and something in French that includes the word ""salaam.""

They're to the Housemartins as General Public was to the English Beat, only General Public stunk up the joint. And though the first two cuts do last 12 minutes, this album isn't soft, sweet, or dead on its feet--it's a killer. Its surface is even more feckless and dulcet than the old guys': drummer-turned-vocalist Dave Hemingway trades sugarlumps with Paul Heaton, who sheathes his political edge. The tempos, the keybs, snazzy new guitarist Dave Rotheray and his sneaky-catchy tuns--all are camouflage for Heaton's righteous self-righteousness and radical unease. Personally, I miss the Marxian animus he's abandoned for attacks on the pop power structure and sarcastic relationship songs. But I'm knocked out that he can progress so naturally from subverting garage-pop to subverting the real thing. He's a sweet, soft force to be reckoned with, and if he wants to camouflage his politics I'm willing to credit his motives. The pop power structure is always worth taking on--if you do it right.

Even more obscure stateside since he got lusher conventions, songsmith Paul Heaton does his endangered species proud. The tunes stick, and the lyrics transcend their sarcastic shtick--predictably idiosyncratic though ""You do English/I'll do sums/You break fingers/I'll break thumbs"" may be, it brings you up short anyway. Peter Gabriel/Kate Bush hand Jon Kelly adds musical authenticity, and third vocalist Briana Corrigan sings lines like ""This is the woman you laid"" with just the right edge of icy remorse.

Though Paul Heaton isn't the first or last pop aesthete to tense dark lyrics against lite music, not many have a) set up disparities as stark as ""I love you from the bottom of my pencil case"" or b) gone so literally pop with them. I don't want to make too much of his common touch, which is limited to England, where his extreme Englishness seems (somewhat) less exotic--not many Stateside have sampled the three albums that yield 10 of these tracks, and no one has heard them on the radio. But from Randy Newman's liberal elitism to Stephin Merritt's camp, American practitioners of this strategy like to pretend they're putting something over. So maybe Heaton's pop credibility is a reward for his sincere belief that the same people who suck up sweet music have an appetite for bitter sentiments. And maybe he seems so much deeper than Ben Folds because he's never snide. Sarcastic, bloody well right. Fond of his own cleverness, he'll drink to that. Tuneful, that's his fookin job. But pissed off to the heart.

By the time pop grandmaster Paul Heaton threw this covers album to his U.K. hordes, his American fanbase was so small it had drowned in a pint of bitter. Yet the Britannia-ruling Olivia-ELO-Zombies trifecta that opens is no less winning than the all-American Ramones-Stylistics parlay that closes, and the Heppelbaums country song is more Willie Nelson than the Willie Nelson country song even though the Heppelbaums are actually Paul Heaton and Dave Rotheray. Moreover, the U.K.-specific selections from Spice Girls spinoff S Club 7 and major-label shoegazers Lush fit in less cunningly than the brazen Blue Oyster Cult and Rufus Wainwright picks. Every rendition is sly, dulcet, midtempo, with strings when appropriate--a beloved pop confection.

What I don't get is how they lost their mojo in their native land--disbanding in 2007, they announced, due to ""musical similarities."" Their final album is middle of the pack by their high standards, opening with six unfailingly witty tunes, most of which reflect cynically on romantic love although there is that one about the Manchester rain, and closing with six less consistent songs Ray Davies would embrace socialism to have written. I suppose it could have been the drinking. I read where Paul now owns a pub in Manchester, records solo a bit, and continues to embrace socialism.

I first encountered this genial Camerounian savant via his pioneering if romantic 1969 overview African Music: A People's Art. But though I knew from the book jacket that he'd worked for UNESCO and published novels, the albums that trickled my way--sanza exhibit, wan protest songs, retrospective miscellany--seemed too schematic musically. So I never grasped that this public intellectual was a successful creator of singing commercials and African hits until this conceptually cockamamy attempt to stir up the hipsterati by linking songs notable for their jingle quotient to electronica. Created on a primitive synthesizer in Paris, they're above all winning and catchy, their sonics almost as quaint as thumb piano by now. Though half are also on La Condition Masculine, which is generally deemed Bebey's best album, this selection is hookier from the just-released ""New Track,"" whose subject is white starchy foods, to ""The Coffee Cola Song,"" whose subject is the cash economy. Dieu merci, both are in English, which helps the French ones fit in--the instrumentals too. And ""Divorce pygmee"" and ""Pygmy Love Song"" have it both ways, clarifying between them the bemused respect with which this cosmopolitan Protestant regards his native continent's profusely musical peoples.

Hipsters are wary of ""Loser."" It was a ""novelty,"" they fret; frat boys liked it. So one reason they swear by this entry pass for denizens of the Club Club is that except for a touch of hip hop retro there's nothing so easy to swallow here. Not quite forbidding, it embeds its lyricism in soundscape, and only prolonged, well-intentioned exposure will enable outsiders to get inside its skilled flow and ramshackle sonic architecture. Worth the effort, absolutely. But for me, its unpretentious aural array, which shares an aesthetic with contemporary hip hop from Tricky to Wu-Tang, doesn't evoke any more specifically than its lyrics do. What's more, I doubt it signifies for anybody else either--except in the personal-to-arbitrary unreadability of its individual sound choices.

Mellow Gold's loser thumbed his nose at the world; Odelay's winner put his mark on it. On this adjustment to musical fashion, a success story discovers what he already knew but hadn't seen up close--eventually, winners lose. No longer immersed in failure, which you joke about (and then beat), he takes on decay, which you hold at bay (for a while). Although he hones his insults when the occasion arises, forget jokes--he's in mourning for dead relationships and the bodily passing they prefigure, and he sounds it. But because he's kept up with the times, he also sounds lyrical and elegiac, evoking the soft nostalgia of folk-rock without falling into it. Embracing the new directness, he feints and sidesteps just like always, exploiting a fad's expressive potential like the shape-shifter he remains.

But the reason to believe is a line apiece in the two slow-it-down-a-littles that follow, both of a shamelessness Michael and Prince will be lucky to equal again.

But its acolytes aren't on very friendly terms with their brains--when their music isn't just stupid, it pampers the vaguer emotions. Behrman's a poetic intellectual, a post-Cagean electronic composer whose moods and textures are generous enough for semipop--or for sentimentality, some ""rigorous"" academic rivals might sniff, as if they'd know. These computerized synth pieces interact with live violin on ""Interspecies Smalltalk,"" live trumpet on ""Leapday Night.""

Protopomo chameleon Alex Chilton had so much Anglophile in him he didn't need this full-fledged Beatle obsessive to create Big Star's world-historic Radio City and suicidal Third. And where Chilton evolved toward bent cabaret-rock, Bell's secret vice was folkiedom. But it's clear from Bell's very posthumous solo album--recorded mostly in 1975, three years before he slammed his TR-6 into a telephone pole--that Big Star was his idea. Stuck inside of Memphis with the Liverpool blues again, so pop-against-them he never fully grasped the function of the rhythm section, he was every bedroom bohemian who ever drove 300 miles to see the Kinks. Yet at the same time his spiritual yearnings are hippie on ""I Am the Cosmos"" (adolescent self-absorption at its most sex-starved), Southern on ""Better Save Yourself"" (in Jesus's name, amen), and both on ""There Was a Light"" (God meets gurl as if Bell's truly secret vice was Al Green).

Sly guys, subtler gals. Straight out the stereo, they didn't have enough oomph to open my clip drawer--they go for dim where corporate pop favors hot, their lo-fi more Exile on Main Street than Sebadoh. So I assumed they were two or three twee public-school snobs just smart enough to mock their own privilege, with stray art-buddies chipping in. In fact it appears (although they are coy about it) that they comprise seven popwise Scots in the same general record-collector tradition as Orange Juice, Teenage Fanclub, and Bis, none of whom sound like Belle and Sebastian or each other. And while younger folks debate the intellectual content of Stuart Murdoch's mild-mannered cynicism, for me his clever affect is there to test the strength of his third-power catchiness. You don't just recognize these tunes. You don't just hum snatches in tranquility. You sing along, irresistibly, sometimes with verse and chorus both. Just be glad Murdoch is into bemused sex rather than the glories of E, or attacks on the culture industry.

Just as decisive is the bemused contour of Tanya Donelly's voice--slanted and enchanted, as some clever soul put it.

If he didn't make me laugh where his fellow wannabees make me wince (while trying to make me laugh), I might even figure him for one of those losers who claims Beck got his best shit from Paleface.

Except that in a typical completist-baiting maneuver, it adds seven forgettable previously uncompileds (OK, ""Don't You Lie to Me"" is good) and to make room axes unquestionable stuff that only begins with ""Anthony Boy,"" and ""Have Mercy Judge."" Still ace music, of course--at least the instrumentals are under control. But dock it two notches for profiteering anyway--and avoid the similarly misbegotten new Louis Jordan package altogether.

FALSE,A-,Chuck,Chuck Berry,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17064,"
In the first 89 years of his life, Chuck Berry recorded two full-length albums worthy of the name, neither currently available for under a C-note although one is set for reissue: 1964's St. Louis to Liverpool, three comeback classics plus seven keepers that include the atypically companionable ""You Two"" and the atypically familial ""Little Marie"" as well as two atypically engaging instrumentals. The other is the 1979 groove album Rockit, sharpened by two back-end songs skewering the racist society he'd striven so audaciously to integrate and enlighten. That was his last record for 38 years, when he generated this de facto farewell, which stands as both a summation he put his all into and a little something he might have followed up if he hadn't up and died at 90. Mischievous and horny and locked in, he plays undiminished guitar as a few subtle guest shots add texture. His timbre has deepened--on the recitative ""Dutchman,"" he's a relaxed near-bass. But he's hale vocally and acute verbally on eight well-crafted new ones and two savvy covers that indicate he's learned a few things--the warm songs to the long-suffering wife he married in 1948 and the progeny who chime in like they've earned it have the kind of detail he always reserved for his fictions, musical and otherwise. I've never stopped loving Chuck Berry as an artist, but it's been a while since I thought the old reprobate was anything but a fucked up human being. This miracle gives me second thoughts.

Bethany Cosentino believes romance is a myth--not a lie, a myth, like Sisyphus. That's why she decks her deliberately simple tunes in echo effects that also obscure the specificity of her already multi-tracked singing voice, why ""weed"" is damn near the only concrete noun on the entire record unless that burning ball of gas in the sky counts. Musically, the idea is to recreate the Beach Boys' aura 50 years later. Thematically, it's to prove that she's a postmodern girl who knows better. The catch is that through all her generalizations it soon becomes clear that she needs that guy much more than a postmodern girl is supposed to. Too bad she can't pin it down and also can't pin him down. I blame the weed.

Crisply songful after years of feedback and drone, it's Carol Van Dyk-not-Dijk and her backup band. About time, too--not because there's anything wrong with feedback or drone, but because neither should preclude songs when you proffer yourself as a pensive woman who takes the occasional Tylenol and deserves someone she can love back. ""Unsound"" is their most clearly irresistible ever, and the aural nimbi that surround or trail after the others never obscure Van Dyk's lines of thought.

A bigger and looser band than the one that made its name with Palomine in alt's salad days--brawnier, brainier, sweeter, more direct. But where once they were the future, now they're near forgotten, because what for their admirers was a game, a phase, or a fleeting passion, for Carol Van Dyk is a life. Alt's college cheerleaders have matured. Van Dyk's just gotten older, embracing soul and skill but not the mainstream: ""Smack in the middle of ridiculous places, smack in the middle where I shouldn't have been."" Of course, part of their gimmick was how alt they weren't. They've always gravitated toward straightforward tunes and guitar voicings, which is why horns that would obtrude in any ordinary alt-fledged band seem natural horning in here. So please, somebody make me feel stupid and tell me what '60s solo they quote outright on the eight-minute ""White Dogs"" jam. It's driving me crazy.

Black, thirty-four, the fourteenth of seventeen children, this upwardly mobile former civil-rights worker and self-taught musician (he never sang in church) has the surprising, unfakable attractiveness of the gifted semipro--he writes and sings as if he still revels in the rewards of getting it just . . . right. His songs are about black courage, hypocrisy, and ambivalence in a world shaped but not defined by racism; many of them ring like the proverbs and fables that provide him with crucial bits of language. The melodies are as sensible and eloquent as the lyrics, and Calvin Carter's production respects and augments Bevel's relaxed folk-soul voice.

""Whammy Kiss"" and ""Butterbean"" do actually concern sex and food, respectively, while ""Legal Tender"" and ""Queen of Las Vegas"" show off a healthy respect for money--that is, a disrespectful attraction to its alluring usefulness. ""Song for a Future Generation"" is a completely affectionate, completely undeluded look at the doomed, hopeful, cheerfully insincere dreams and schemes of the kids who dance to B-52's songs.

Kate and Cindy have also been working out since the combo unleashed their best album in 25 years in 2008. Nor is their first in-concert album undercut by the nine tracks it shares with their best-of or the five it shares with their comeback, because it's bigger than either.

Though you can understand why the soaring interplay of the Bhundus' post-chimurenga is classified as a soukous variant, it's folkier in basic approach and rockier in basic instrumentation, as comes clear on their Zimbabwe-recorded second album. Though the sound is thinner than FM technocrats might decree, it suits the band's peculiarly Zimbabwean polyrhythms, in which guitars and keybs take over lines indigenous to the thumb piano. Anyway, it's not so thin you're gonna notice as you fly around the ceiling. Congenital lead-asses start with side two.

Where the stoned undertow of Thomas Mapfumo's chimurenga remembered struggle, the light, bright jit of Zimbabwe's Bhundu Boys was pure liberation music.  Leader Biggie Tembo named them after his role as a runner in Mugabe's army, but that was over, and did they ever sound happy about it. Revving mbira guitar into soukous flights as they loosened intense Soul Brothers harmonies, they caught Britain's sole Afropop wave in the middle '80s and concocted an English-language crossover album nobody found as accessible as the two Shona LPs that made it possible. A decade later four of them were dead--three of AIDS, the long-departed or -ousted Tembo a suicide and Mugabe was a certified tyrant. In historical perspective, the ebullience of this two-CD set, everything from the first two albums plus half a dozen nonfiller extras, is pop innocence at its most poignant. They're not faking a thing--they were young, and they'd known triumph. But soon enough they would be.

Last things first: I wish I could never again hear the jocularly misogynist David Blaine skit at the ass end of ""General Patton"" in my entire life.  But it's not tracked, so insofar as the pervasive albeit incoherent musicality of this overrated good album calls me back, it will always be there to waylay me. Granted, so will a succession of enjoyable songs with plenty to offer. But direct comparison to any post-Aquemini OutKast establishes not Andre's superiority--that's ambition and always has been--but the congruence of two timbres and deliveries that resembled each other far more than did the big boys who put them across. I feel the juice of Big Boi's ""dark fudge brownie with the nut of your choice"" and cheer when he mocks ""coke-ayena."" But without OutKast's synergy, few of his many good moves are slam dunks.

No hip-hopper has ever been bigger on getting up when you're down and making every minute count. Could get tiresome, but on a no-cameos mixtape Def Jam couldn't clear, his proudly drawled, lucidly conceived preachments go undefeated.

From the Raybeats and Love Tractor and the Dixie Dregs to Tortoise and the Thinking Fellers Union and Frisell Feeling Frisky, guitar-based instrumental groups have long been a fact of the rock and roll life, and generally they split the difference between expert and professional. These three guys--headman Stephen Ulrich playing one guitar at a time, agile Paul Dugan dwarfed by his string bass, and show drummer Tamir Muskat doubling as chief producer--up the ante. They cross genres without making a thing of their eclecticism. They love melody, and they also write it. They seem through-composed even when they're improvising. They're virtuosic and interactive without speed runs or shows of collective sensitivity. Most endearingly, they don't think intelligence requires subtlety. Their last album was soundtrack in mood. This one's more program music--told that one track was called ""Train Travel"" and the other ""Tavern Life,"" you'd know which was which.

Nostalgia has nothing to do with it. For Alex Chilton, redefining garage pop with Chris Bell, Jody Stephens, and Andy Hummel was but a single obscure step on a pilgrim's progress toward eternal oblivion, and that they came up with one of the great catalogues in the process merely constituted one of life's little ups and downs. Here he and Stephens and a couple of Posies who play loud even if they sing wimpy remake that catalogue as a rock and roll noisier and more impolite than anything he would have tried at the time.

To the sexy singsong, colorful patois, and spacy tracks of Jamaican toasting, Manley Buchanan adds something like unalloyed joy--he looks and often sounds like the happiest man on earth. It's not just ganja, either--if ganja could do that, Peter Tosh would be the happiest man on earth. Somehow Youth embodies everything most benign about Rastafarianism--even when he's berating Babylon, which is often, he's unsectarian about it, suffused with humanitarian compassion for all victims of wickedness, Babylonians included. His most songful album is full of suffering and violence, yet its fundamental mood is one of gentle transport, the spiritual certainty of the born prophet.

Especially given the label's fondness for sonic byways, I admit that these three CDs of obscure-inna-Babylon Manley Buchanan filled me with gray-haired professional dread. Oh I-and-I of little faith. Youth remains an unimaginable original whatever his debt to U-Roy, whose (comparatively) suave presence on the two-part ""Battle of the Giants"" only highlights the younger toaster's innocence and joy. Rapping, chanting, preaching, sing-songing, ripping off War or Ike &amp; Tina or the Last Poets, Youth never undercuts his race-conscious commitment to agape. Even invoking damnation's ""Hotter Fire"" he assumes no prophetic airs, and he details the poverty of ""Riverton City"" as if reciting a nursery rhyme--as if he's the little child who shall lead us. His mission is to render palatable a Rastafarianism he knows as the simple word of Jah. The rhythms are obviously essential. But only on the dubbier final disc do his revealed truths lose any charm.

By now male hardcore bands feel obliged to at least master the fast four-four, which has its advantages but ends up formulaic. This music scorns all rules--there's no way to prepare for it. The primitive tunes stick like peanut butter to the barbed-wire sound, and while Kathleen Hanna stays calm on her love song ""For Tammy Rae,"" she prefers to break her lyrics down into preverbal emotion--the big-dick grunts of ""Sugar,"" the can't-come screams of ""Star Bellied Boy,"" the scratch-your-eyes-out ululations of ""Li'l Red.""

The first album got over on spirit. Here Kathleen Hanna's vocals and Bill Karren's guitar add definition, confidence, (let's bite the bullet and call it) technical skill. Also, right, tunes.

It's striking and impressive the way they ratcheted their popcraft down. With this band, incoherence was always a way of knowledge, imbuing their spew of ideas and feelings with a conviction that made one's confusion about whether they actually liked fucking or not irrelevant.

There's been a Lou Reed enclave around Cleveland since the late-Velvets days, and recently it's begun to produce musicians; maybe the real reason the Dead Boys left for New York was to avoid comparison with bands as smart as Devo and Pere Ubu. Even so, a self-produced album showcasing ten good songs is a pleasant shock. The Bizarros' deliberate discordances (including viola, lest we forget John Cale) are carried forward on surefire junk-rock riffs; mastermind Nick Nicholis has the hang of Lou's deadpan songspeech, although some of his mannerisms are otiose and the promising lyrics aren't worked as fine as they must be to sound natural. The stoopider approach of the Rubber City Rebels--""Gotta get a brain job/Gotta get it now/Gotta get a brain job/But I don't know how""--proves more foolproof.

Lick the backs of my knees sex. OK, where my buttcheeks join my thighs sex. I'm still a little jumpy so you'd better pet me some more sex. How many different ways can we open our mouths together sex. We came 20 minutes ago and have Sunday morning ahead of us sex. Or, if fucking, tantric--the one where you don't move and let vaginal peristalsis do the work (yeah sure). The atmospherics, glitch techno, harps, glockenspiels, and shades of Hilmar Om Hilmarsson float free sometimes, and when she gets all soprano on your ass you could accuse her of spirituality. But with somebody this freaky you could get used to that. English lyrics provided, most of them dirty if you want.

Not because they refuse to ""contribute to genocide"" by faking gangsta ""reality,"" although that's nice, but because they refuse to contribute to the pleasureless us-versus-them of the old-school ethos. As philosophy, their spirituality is icky. As music, it's profusely generous, overflowing with tribal chants and doo-wop choruses and easygoing basslines.

In her pretty little voice, Sarah Nixey convinces the world that rich English girls have every right to hate their rich English parents and covers the happy ragga-reggae ""Up Town Top Ranking"" and the morbid teen-chanson ""Seasons in the Sun"" as if they reflect the identical sensibility, which now they do.

So I hardly heard the 1985 studio LPs Loose Nut and In My Head, which prove their sharpest since Damaged, with Loose Nut especially showing off Greg Ginn's fangs as lyricist and riffmaster. The demented acceleration and guitar squiggles of this live date improve most of the hottest songs from the '85 albums. And while introducing the band members by cock size may protest their belated obsession with sex too much, I can't complain when the answer to the title question is Kira, who plays bass so stalwartly she deserves all the credit she can get.

There's more fun, which means room for choice, in Buster Poindexter's novelty ""Hot Hot Hot"" than in the coercive carnivalesque of Arrow's soca original. So what first attracted me to this Trinbago Rasta wasn't his antiparty politics, as in ""Wait Dorothy Wait,"" whose verses list the panoply of injustices that will have to go before he can write verses to match the ""smutty"" chorus. It was the slackness of his music--his sun-warmed arrangements and smoker's baritone. Anyone resourceful enough to own his 1982 Caribbean Man will balk at repurchasing its seven best tracks. But the lyrics, notes, and remixes are all improvements, and so are the four later songs. Even ""Dorothy"" is eclipsed by ""Burn Dem,"" in which he begs Saint Peter to let him throw down Christopher Columbus, Cecil Rhodes, and Margaret Thatcher himself.

Even saluting Slick Rick (in a tale where the bad kid jacks beats instead of grandmas) or the Funky Four Plus One (and neoclassicist breakdancers), they're never ""raw,"" no matter what they think. On the contrary, they're cooked as hell. Making hard lyrical as they drop ""black like the perception of who on welfare"" and ""you must be history because you keep repeating yourself,"" they devise a hip hop imaginary where hater players lose their girls-not-bitches to MCs so disinterested they give 'em right back.

Nor do I miss the horns that helped make Siembra, his most renowned Willie Colon collaboration, an international phenomenon. The seven-man rhythm section he sings with here encourages conversational intimacy and renders irrelevant the high romanticism classic soneros drown in and Blades doesn't have the voice for. It also accents the narrative details which Blades the writer provides in such abundance. Nor must you know Spanish (or follow the crib sheet) to enjoy his rhythmic, melodic, and dramatic subtleties--they're right there in the music.

In a vibrato-shaded baritone that recalls a French chansonnier more than an Americana guitar guy, the first singer-songwriter in history to linger on the word ""gerrymander"" enlists a limber band colored decisively by horn man Thomas Deakin to array sixteen talky songs lasting a mere hour and a half over two CDs. Chants that riff on the titles ""Work,"" ""Couples,"" and ""Single Women"" (""Haven't been laid in years,"" ""Are always late,"" ""Get to work on time,"" ""Got lucky last night"") are as instantly indelible as the Springsteen, Weill, Reed, and Van Morrison lifts woven in, and the disc-openers do equal justice to ""The Other Side of Fck It"" and ""Rock &amp; Roll Dream.""

Sure this trio has its own sound, kind of--jagged, perky, sprung. And more important, songs. But so many indie bands have sound and songs that they flop or fly on content anyway, and here content means Juliana Hatfield. For their varying gender-based reasons, some men and some women find her too cute, but I say she's a former girl who's willing to be winsome and has her gender-based beefs regardless, e.g. ""I'm not your mother."" Later, probably with a different guy, she pops the big question: ""If I called on you from far away/Would you say the things I want you to say?"" I would, Juliana, I would, whisper a million (or anyway a couple thousand) lonely fellows. But when it came down to cases they probably wouldn't.

Thank punk and the Berklee Music School she isn't the folkie she would have been in an earlier counterculture. Cutting her upper-middle-class enunciation with open-tuned pitch, strange chords she can just barely play, and enough guitar noise to get the circulation going, she earns the right to steal her namesake's title.

Since it costs the same per track as the matched 1998 Duke and Dunhill Greatest Hits collections I recommended back in the day, my review is mostly discographical bookkeeping. Although it includes all of the Duke disc's tracks, it goes rogue on Bland's Dunhill years while retaining the half dozen or so essentials. But in the wake of the big man's death, more is more, and by doubling the Duke picks, most of them uptempo, this accesses some major work--""Little Boy Blue"" and ""Ain't Doin' Too Bad"" discoveries for me, ""Poverty"" and ""Ain't Nothing You Can Do"" (!!) conspicuous omissions from GH. So if you're just getting started, it's probably the right choice. If you aren't, do the math yourself. Docked a notch on general principles.

Insofar as it's now dimly believed that blues and soul were the same thing, kinda, perhaps I can rescue B.B. King's perpetual opposite number from the limbo of name recognition by promoting him as a great soul voice. After all, he did sing gospel before moving down, up, or over to Beale Street, and by the time mean old Don Robey sold him up the river, he was ready for anything--soul, lounge, country, disco, B.B. duets. Be it an aab gem like ""Goin' Down Slow"" or generic gold like ""Yolanda"" or a pop gewgaw like ""Love To See You Smile,"" he claims these songs with his suave baritone and trademarks them with his unique growl. Never played an instrument, or danced much. Never had to. Proves sophistication has nothing to do with diplomas.

Even though the parent corp owns Duke-Peacock, where Don Robey held Bland in servitude while compelling him to record Robey-copyrighted crap by the fictional Deadric Malone, Bland's catalogue is the usual mess. I estimate that anyone who chooses to own MCA's two early-'90s Duke double-CDs, I Pity the Fool and Turn On Your Love Light, can add the one-volume Greatest Hits Volume Two: The ABC-Dunhill/MCA Recordings and stop there. I also estimate that the use value of his most renowned original-release album, Two Steps From the Blues, is significantly diminished by all the duplications on almost any Duke-era best-of one might chance upon. But this surprisingly intelligent 16-track comp is different. Half Duke, half MCA-etc., it showcases the Bland I've never trusted: the schlock adept, the midtempo crooner-groaner who dug Texas-sized horn sections and was fine with strings, the lover who played in the same league as jazz status symbol Billy Eckstine and citified rivals Lou Rawls and Brook Benton. And it convinces me I prefer Bland to any of them. Never flaunting his virtuosity like Eckstine or conflating smarm and cool like Rawls or clinging to Nat Cole's coattails like Benton, Bland begins by nailing two Malone songs too dull for anyone else to sing, reminds you what a mother he is with ""Ain't Nothing You Can Do,"" and then goes cornball commando, claiming a Malone trifle Aretha Franklin took over in 1969 as well as ""If Loving You Is Wrong,"" ""Georgia on My Mind,"" and ""I've Got to Use My Imagination."" Tossing in the occasional signature growl, he relies on his midrange like a veteran fastballer working the corners and never cracks the ice as he skates the groove. Insofar as these songs can be killed, he does the deed.

Ex-Canned Heat piano man Gene Taylor and a horn section anchored by New Orleans's own Mr. Lee Allen wreck that neobilly image, as do the three reempowered remakes from their debut. Neobilly's just an excuse that lets them play blues--plus r&amp;b, country, New Orleans, all the unfashionable vernaculars they love--to a young and hungry audience in a recharged dramatic context. If the originals work better than the covers, that's partly because Phil Alvin's expressive moan does sound pinched sometimes, so even when you don't know the source recording (which you probably don't), you can imagine it fuller. And it's partly because Dave Alvin is a songwriter with John Fogerty's bead on the wound-tight good times of America's tough white underbelly.

Her song sense rooted in slow jams not soul, her soul rooted in radio not the church, Blige is a diva for her own time. As befits her hip hop ethos, she's never soft if often vulnerable, and as befits her hip hop aesthetic, she plays her natural vocal cadences for melodic signature and sometimes hook. Too strong to talk dirty, she leaves not the slightest doubt of her sexual prowess. She redefines the New York accent for the '90s. And she's taken two straight follow-ups to the next level.

Because she cultivates youth-center loose rather than arena big, Blige's de facto best-of is more than an enlargement. If her raucous tone and sour pitch aren't deliberate, they aren't unwitting either--she believes, correctly, that her fans will relish them as tokens of honesty.

Rather than hating playas, she's bored with them. Between Aretha and Lauryn and the sister who knocked on the door and just by being sincere convinced Mary she'd had Mary's man's baby, all that she can say is that she's ready to love someone serious and walk away from anyone who isn't. Unless you count Bennie and the Jets, her pop allies don't do all that much for her song sense, which is why her live album is still where to begin. But two more like this and she'll be ready for another. A girl who can come out of a Diane Warren song with no symptoms of soul death has performed a miracle that defied Al Green.

Back in the day, the Aretha comparisons were ignorant--Mary's early albums weren't all they were cracked up to be, and neither was her voice. But a decade and a half later, she deserves respect. Like Aretha, her hip-hop soul has long since transmuted into a working relationship with actually existing black pop, which right now just means pop. On 2005's breakthrough The Breakthrough, that was interpreted to mean soft. This time, happily, Busta Rhymes and Ludacris get her back to where she once belonged for the duration of their openers. After that, it's an expensive, honorable, credible sampler of the hottest current R&amp;B brands, with multiple nods to Ne-Yo and ""Umbrella."" Even the homiletic ""Stay Down"" will grow on you, though not for as long as Geffen hopes. The comparison this all doesn't quite live up to: Aretha's multiproduced, hip-hop-friendly A Rose Is Still a Rose, now disgracefully out of print (though you can buy it cheap used). Ten years from now, this best-seller won't have suffered that fate--if ""in print"" means anything at all in 2018.

Blige's Brit pick-me-up has the general effect of taking a load off. Hooks of neither Swedish nor American manufacture provide a freshness--try Disclosure's on ""Follow"" or Naughty Boy's on ""Pick Me Up""--and when she's beset by doubt, as is always going to happen with Mary, she doesn't get overwrought about it. Matched by the spare piano-and-drums of her countryman Rodney Jerkins, she contains herself even on the pain-wracked ""Whole Damn Year."" But though I love ""Therapy"" for telling us exactly where she's coming from, I wish I didn't suspect that the heal-thyself nostrum ""Not Loving You"" was ghostwritten by her therapist.

He's an entertainer who's always willing to please, and though his blues are sad and sometimes touching, they never twist you, words and vocals are mostly serviceable, and the instrumental virtuosity treasured by blues scholars is technical rather than expressive. Of course, one reason his rather monotonous tunes go down so pleasantly at this late date is the deft rhythms he plays against them. The other is his willingness to please; such mild gimmicks as guest vocalist, patter lyrics, and novelty expostulations may have been record business cliches at the time, but they sure sound fresh now.

Way too old in real life to stop at kissing, and also way too horny, they assume the persona of guys for whom kissing and even holding hands are a big deal, which even for mean, old, and/or horny guys they often are.

From Portland--no, silly, not the Maine one--this third-time's-a-charm indie band gets through 13 songs in 34 minutes with no apparent rush, yet comes off frantic anyway. Their sprung rhythms and imploding guitars suggest the Band as much as Pavement only because the lyrics that break free of the clatter sing the praises of pastoral seclusion. So Portland. In all its urban greenery, or is it green urbanity?

This makes it in the end, but not by much--a tour de force like Parallel Lines it ain't. The soft focus of the lyrics remains more evasive than profound or mysterious, and a lot of what replaces the diminished popcraft either wanders (""Sound-A-Sleep"") or repeats experiments we've heard before (""Victor""). Then again, ""Sound-A-Sleep"" probably ought to wander, since it's about insomnia and the pushy organ hysterics of ""Victor"" are a gutsy move for a group that's supposed to have gone AOR. I don't like the overarching fatalism--me, I hope to die old and get ugly--but I do like the way the lyrics depart from pop bohemia to speak directly to the mass audience they're reaching. And Debbie just keeps getting better.

This could convince the unwary listener that they're the great mindless pop band they pose as--songs from all over the place cohere as if they were created only to get on the radio. Nor is this impression discouraged by the tactful Mike Chapman remixes that bring three early efforts into the new wave age. But go back to Parallel Lines, or the first side of Plastic Letters, and recall how an art band makes songs cohere--it creates them to go on a record. If they also get on the radio, that means the scam worked.

Forms lose their spring; social configurations fissure and disintegrate. But what usually wears out first is the commitments they inspire, and here the commitment is as palpable as such ironic formalists can make it. Chris Stein is still a great listener, and Debbie Harry never stopped growing. She sings with a force and technical command unimaginable in 1980, and producer Craig Leon comes back at her resonance for resonance. No new song will equal your very favorites. But as a ""Rapture""/""One Way or Another"" guy, I'll trade the sexo-mystico ""Screaming Skin"" for ""Heart of Glass,"" the Euro-friendly ""Maria"" for ""Call Me,"" and No Exit for, oh, Eat to the Beat.

Not much clever pan-referentiality in the most consistent material this 43-year-old band has assembled since No Exit, half a career ago in 1998. But for a 72-year-old glamourpuss to excavate multiple affairs in one post-ironic, pro-erotic song after another--only two Stein-Harry, although there's also a Hynes-Harry and their newish 4?-year-old keyb guy chips in a couple--is a lyrical coup in itself. Any youngish person who doesn't buy her ""Take me back home again/I wanna make love again,"" not to mention 53-year-old Johnny Marr's ""Human beings are stupid things when we're young,"" has much to learn about the aging process in this ever-changing world we hope we all age in. Yes, she's had ""work done,"" and one way or another, so to speak, this may extend to her vocals. But neither her voice nor the rest of her body is any less hers than it ever was.

Don't let the spoken-word samples that signify Dev Hynes's intellectual ambitions distract you from the smartest stuff here--namely, the choruses that beckon you through them. Then home in on the extraordinary run of women singers who enliven and intensify his songs as past collaborators have not: Empress Of, Carly Rae Jepsen, Zuri Marley, Debbie Harry, Nelly Furtado, Kelsey Lu, BEA1991, Ava Raiin. And dig how casually he varies his falsetto with bass-baritone chant-raps and juices his keyboards with percussion. The ambitions themselves could be clearer--why should ""Hands Up"" be so much more explicit about police violence than ""Squash Squash"" is about lives lost to addiction? But credit Hynes with connecting his romantic instability to a personal insecurity that in turn connects to what the larger society makes of his blackness and queerness--and for having the consciousness to insist that his blackness is rooted in Africa, and not just because his father was born there.

Jazz musicians so often try and fail to modernize their rhythms that I wondered what the secret of the latest Matthew Shipp-William Parker collaboration might be. Clever devils--no drummer. All beats electronic, generated by Brooklyn production duo Danny Blume and Chris Kelly, who relax into cunning patterns that leave room for Parker to bend his bass toward an equivalent of the reassuring body groove that jazz folk associate with swing. Only this groove doesn't swing--it's more like techno that realized acid jazz was garbage and went back home to mama. Shipp riffs, hooks, and decorates, leaving theme and cognitively dissonant variation to name trumpeter Roy Campbell and two trombonists, who have most of the fun. Not deep, not intense. But for atmosphere, it hangs on there, and it keeps growing on you.

Exploiting and burlesquing the style's whiteskin privilege from ""Smoked Pork"" to ""Cop Killer,"" Ice-T's metal album takes rap's art-ain't-life defense over the top. Not only does he off pigs, he murders his mom--because she taught him to hate white people. Then he cuts her up, sticks her well-catalogued body parts in Hefty bags, deposits same all over this great land of ours, and suggests that listeners with parents on the racist tip follow his example. For Satanism he tangles with a voodoo queen and enters the ""Bowels of the Devil,"" a/k/a the state pen. He wilds with Tipper's 12-year-old nieces, fucks his ""KKK Bitch"" in the ass when a rally gets his dick hard, and fakes an orgasm for good measure. And like any long-haired frontman worth his chart position, he sings a tender ballad--in which a coke fiend steals enough money to buy the best shit, then goes cardiac when he smokes it.

There've been other Body Count albums in the quarter century since ""Cop Killer"" put a police bull's-eye on the pre-Law and Order Ice-T's back. But it took Donald Trump to revive Tracy Marrow's active interest in the metal band he assembled with his Crenshaw High buddy Ernie C. back when he was a hot rapper. In this year of the rock protest song, there hasn't yet been a lyric as bitter, complex, and powerful as ""No Lives Matter."" From the lead ""Civil War,"" set in the present and let's hope it remains a fiction, to ""Black Hoodie,"" less hard-hitting but wider-ranging than Vic Mensa's ""16 Shots,"" you feel both a mind at work and an entertainer putting himself across. In the title track, Ice includes himself in the humanity whose propensity for murder he's been going on about. In ""Here I Go Again"" he concocts a horrorcore fantasy so gruesome he figures most people won't want to hear it twice and bets some sickos will put on repeat.

As careful perusal of Greil Marcus's liner essay reveals, Boggs's legend is based on just eight traditional songs. He cut them in New York in 1927, and there's no better demonstration of how good they are than the four he laid down in Chicago in 1929. In New York he's so full of beans he can scarcely contain himself. If on the one hand he's truly enacting these dark-to-grisly tales, on the other hand they can't touch him; it's Waiting for Godot, in which the intrinsic excitement of creation subsumes all incidental pessimism, plus ""I Want To Hold Your Hand,"" in which one's imminent conquest of the world infuses the humblest ditty with an exhilaration that carries all before it. Where Marcus hears an acceptance of death, I hear intimations of immortality--bitter laughter and defiant cunning, sap rising and blood flowing, meanness and exuberance and sarcasm and deviltry, a refusal to succumb to consequences. Two years later, on leave from the mining town he now senses he'll never escape, Boggs is the image of fatalistic impassivity, as dull as the lyrics he's been handed by the wannabe label owner who underwrote his trip to the city. Soon he would give in to his wife and stop playing for 30 years.

Omara Moctar--the ""Al"" has fallen into disuse as he internationalizes--remains easily the loveliest of the Tuareg guitarists to come our way, and in fact this album was begun in the Cambridge, Massachusetts, home studio of a filmmaker who documented the Tuaregs' battle for autonomy in Niger. He's absorbed many Western guitarists into a style few will hear as Western without a cheat sheet, and sings quietly, like he's thinking about it. Relative to most Tuareg music, the result is pretty tame. But its directness and calm take on spiritual weight when you learn that Bombino lost two members of his band during the most recent phase of the now quiescent and perhaps permanently resolved war. Cumbancha's representatives to the world congress tend polite, but as a corollary the label considers it good manners to offer expanded explanation, documentation, and visualization online. Avail yourself.

But with an American bassist on half the tracks and a German drummer doubling Bombino's own guy half the time too, this is the hardest-rocking of the hard-traveling Tuareg guitarist's three distinct albums. It does sweeten as it proceeds, as befits the ""nostalgia"" two first-ever translations cite--a nostalgia anybody whose homeland is a war zone has earned. The lyrics are very simple. My favorite, in its entirety: ""This era/The era of young girls/Their way of loving/Works in a different way/Prayers to you, my brothers/Better to be sensitive/For our girls/Those of this era.""

Listen to his Jerry Williams-produced late-'60s stuff and you hear undistinguished Otis Redding cum Swamp Dogg. But listen to his Frank Guida-produced early-'60s hits and you almost can't hear him at all--Guida was so inept in the studio that Bonds comes in at about the same level as the crowd noises and Gene ""Daddy G"" Barges's saxophone. Thus he fell into the quintessential twist singles, party records which convinced America that a rather tame and silly dance was the gateway to orgyland.

Definitive: ""13 and Good,"" like ""100 Guns"" before it a morality-tale-sans-moral that makes me wonder whether he's studied Roger Abrahams's anthology of African folk tales or comes by the tone naturally--and yes, I'm sure I know what he thinks about that one.

The florid fanfare that evolves into ""Sixty Minute Man"" before your unsuspecting ears will possibly fool and definitely delight you twice, when it switches over to ""You Talk Too Much"" if not before. Booker likes him some medley effects--the one billed as ""All by Myself/Let the Four Winds Blow"" also includes a verse of ""I'm in Love Again."" ""Tipitina"" and ""Junco Partner"" and ""Rockin' Pneumonia"" are his by eminent domain, the Dr. John songs somehow not. ""Tico Rico"" and ""Besame Mucho"" make a fine pair.

If these were actual songs I'd scoff at their inaudible indecisiveness: listen hard now, ""Our heads approach a density reminiscent of the infinite connectivity of the center of the sun"" in under five seconds.

Going for simple, they pay a price in detail this time out. But the likes of ""Smokin' 100's Alone"" and ""Perfect Far Away"" would be pretty damn rough for Nashville.

""Mendocino"" and ""Stoned Faces Don't Lie"" glow with possibility, evoking '60s utopianism far more concretely than any precious latter-day studio psychedelica. But it has to end. ""You Can't Hide a Redneck Underneath That Hippy Hair,"" Doug realizes. ""The changes in this city made a fool of me/I got too free, forgot I had a family,"" he admits. So, he concludes, ""I'm Not That Kat Anymore."" Out of options, he turns into an icon whose conjunto country r&amp;b will always be longer on rep than edge.

Since as border staters they've never defined their roots regionally, Haynes is free to nudge them folk here and rock there. ""Lucky Break,"" about a disabled construction worker who's finally getting his government cheese, sets the tone.

Weary evocations of the persistence of Monday and airbag duty at the Chrysler plant convince you music isn't his day job whether it is or not.

About half the songs (the earliest from 1927, the latest from 1949) are new to me, and if I'd grown up with the originals, I might find the conceptual distancing a distortion, even a sacrilege. But at this late date it's their salvation. The four vocalists, who betray just enough accent to remind you where they're coming from, honor the era's well-enunciated conventions with care, and Roland Brunt's jazzy sax undercuts the violins without patting itself on the chops. If they were French they'd overdo the camp or the sincerity, but the Dutch have the mercantilist knack of respecting a culture for its natural resources. In fact, at this remove they probably understand it better than we do.

By the time it reaches our tight little backwater, Afropop has generally been winnowed down to some kind of essence--famous tracks by famous artists. The rare albums that originally signified as such tend to be acknowledged masterpieces, rarely dating much earlier than 1980 and often not even recorded in Africa. By comparison, this one could be be some lost Brit obscurity--by the Move, the Soft Boys, you know. Back when Kinshasa was still Leopoldville, Bowane is said to have named Franco and invented a crucial rumba guitar move, but his hit years were over by independence, and when he cut his only album--in 1976, in Ghana, heretofore unreleased due to vinyl crisis--he was just a bizzer. If you didn't wonder briefly what a Francophone big man was doing in an Anglophone studio, perhaps you won't hear the brash yet modest cross-cultural claims of this simple yet polyrhythmic dance music--soukous guitar over highlife beats until the improvs come in.

Musically, these fragments of anomie don't seem felt, and lyrically they don't seem thought through.

Normally I ignore ""enhanced"" classics, as should you, so to distinguish among iterations, this is the three-CD boxlet released in 2010. It includes three color photos of the Thin White Duke, a flier hawking Geoff MacCormack's ""signed, limited edition"" Travels With Bowie 1973-76, informative notes, the original album in its own wee sleeve, and--the bait, in a wee double sleeve--Bowie's March 23, 1976 performance at Nassau Coliseum, warm New York Times review by John Rockwell included, hot Village Voice review by Robert Christgau not. In addition to an echoing momentum with no precedent or aftermath in Bowie's melodramatic oeuvre, highlights include ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" with blues uptick, ""TVC-15"" with New Orleans accent, and a set list that stumbles only on the stone in his passway that is ""Word on a Wing."" It nails a galvanizing arena-rock that you can almost hear hitting a groove that had dissipated disappointingly just three days later at Madison Square Garden. But please note that I said ""almost hear."" As we all should know by now, rarely do galvanizing performances live on in artifact the way they do in memory. Whether this one you missed is worth your 25 bucks depends, I suspect, on just how seriously you credit the artiste's Anglophiliac legend.

So imagine you walk into this, well, lounge in Miami. Or Atlantic City, say. Maybe Chicago. Two old guys are playing, one black and one white, piano and trumpet (cornet, actually, but why quibble?). It's jazz, all right, but not the arty kind--mostly you can follow the melodies, some identifiable (""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" ""Easter Parade,"" even you know those) and many vaguely familiar. The tunes are a little corny, and so's the playing now and then, yet the playing also has an attitude--jaunty or humorous or gently sarcastic or just damn pleased with the whole situation. Not campy at all, and never bad even when it seems generic. In short, it embodies the sophisticated spiritual ideal toward which lounge aspires while remaining too serious and self-possessed to tickle the young twits who claim to have rediscovered the stuff. If you're no twit yourself, two first-rate players and one major 20th-century composer may have something to offer you.

FALSE,A-,The Brains,The Brains,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3508,"
From Steve Lillywhite's loud-with-portent upscale of the perfect ""Money Changes Everything"" to two atrocious Alfredo Villar songs that would fit fine on a Queen album, their magnified shortcomings are an object lesson in major label meets new wave--the compromises undermine art and commerce simultaneously. Fortunately, Tom Gray's gray matter prevails--life has blessed him with a college education and proximity to the Sex Pistols' U.S. debut. Unlike the power-pop boys, he's seen down to the woman underneath his girls, and just because he plays organ doesn't mean he can't punch it up. Lost rock and rollers in a provincial capital, the Brains are the real Iron City Houserockers--forward-looking yet tradition-drenched entertainment.

FALSE,A-,Give Blood,Brakes,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13025,"
The singer from British Sea Power joins three even lesser U.K. alt-rock notables in 16 short-and-shorter ditties about their scenester lives. Some observers classify these ditties ""country-punk,"" while other crankily insist they're ""anti-folk,"" proving mainly that nobody knows what to make of simple little guitar-band songs on a scene where everyone's busy refining his or her artistic vision. But if you believe as I do that the alt-rock subculture means more than almost any individual alt-rocker's vision, they're an up. Four bohemian fellas with a sense of humor who relate actively to their friends and lovers, despise Dick Cheney, and get wasted some--the last of which they'll cut down on.
"
FALSE,A-,The Beatific Visions,Brakes,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13575,"
A hopeful sign, or at least a piece of luck. Finding the Bowie-esque British Sea Power and Doors-esque Electric Soft Parade wanting as life projects, Eamon Hamilton and the brothers Tom and Alex White have made their postpunk goof their main gig. Nine of the 11 songs are fast, and nine of the 11 songs are good--it's as simple as that for once and suggests that some proggy post-er boys (I mean that in so many ways) are capable of returning to their 1977 roots. Not only that, a sweet young thing at the BBC has such a short memory or limited knowledge base that he called their country-flavored punk ""original-sounding.""

FALSE,A-,African Marketplace,Dollar Brand,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8217,"
More than any other jazz musician I know of, the South African pianist doesn't just honor and evoke popular traditions, he redefines them, injecting his Ellinigtonian structures with r&amp;b-based urban dance rhythms and strange (to us) tribal voicings. As often as not his band projects a crudely gorgeous songfulness most unjazzlike in its simplicity--folklike tunes repeat obligingly, ostinatos just don't quit. Take the synthesis for the patriotism of an exile who believes in the wisdom of his people and his land and refuses to indulge his alienation from both.

FALSE,A-,One for All,Brand Nubian,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=436,"
Constricted by rage, sanctimony, and defensive rationalization from Movement Ex to King Sun, most black-supremacist rap sags under the burden of its belief system just like any other ideological music. This Five Percenter daisy-age is warm, good-humored, intricately interactive--popping rhymes every sixth or eighth syllable, softening the male chauvinism and devil-made-me-do-it with soulful grooves and jokes fit for a couch potato. They sound so kind and confident and fun-filled you almost believe that someday they'll throw away their crutches. But just because they were feeling irie when they made their record, don't bet they'll have the good sense or fortune to grab the chance.

This song-filled genre-trip is best enjoyed as a totality, like Endtroducing . . . DJ Shadow. Whether it's constructed or just strung together, its flat moments are spritzed by its highs, which include sexy pomo new jack hip hop, girl-pop Slade/Quiet Riot cover, faux-country faux-fable, numerous humorous middle-class layabouts, several minibricolages, and a sarcastic indictment of capitalism. How eclecticism should work--even if it almost never does.

Soon the air whooshes out except for the Waiting To Exhale hit and ""Love Me Some Him"" with its overdubbed yes, but by then her pop presence is established. The apprentice diva of the debut was modest, composed, virtually anonymous. I'll take the right It Girl anytime--especially one who insists on getting her props.

FALSE,A-,"Love, Marriage & Divorce",Toni Braxton & Babyface,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16256,"
Through one number-one album, two number-two albums, one Vegas run, two Disney-on-Broadway runs, one season of Dancing With the Stars, two bankruptcies, and, absolutely, one divorce, Braxton has been as content-free as a soul diva can be. No wonder Kenny Edmunds grabbed her early on--she was platinum putty in his hands. But recall that Edmunds hasn't been Mr. Magic himself for a while, and assume Braxton would try anything. Bingo. Pretend they're writing/singing from experience. That's their line, and since each is but once-divorced, it has a patina. Weathered now, their mellow voices retain some lustre, and there's narrative arc and emotional texture to the well-doctored material--hurting the one you don't want to hurt, worrying about how she's doing, makeup sex, post-split attraction. Yet amid these consistent songs, the single sole-composer credit stands out, and it's Braxton's: ""I Wish,"" about just how bad she hopes the other woman treats him. Inspirational Verse: ""I hope she gives you a disease/So that you will see/But not enough to make you die/But only make you cry/Like you did me.""

FALSE,A-,Safari,The Breeders,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3510,"
Now posing as a major-label debut, Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly's 1990 Rough Trade one-off Pod still sounds like the art project it was, but although Donnelly is otherwise occupied, this 1992 EP sounds like a band. Postamateur Raincoats, say. They substitute the Who's ""So Sad About Us"" for the Kinks' ""Lola"" because they're less arch and less soft. But they're lovers not fighters nonetheless.
"
FALSE,A-,Last Splash,The Breeders,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3509,"
Kim Deal can't sing and neither can Kelley--not with force, anyway. But what the hey. Unabashed models of feminine weakness, they murmur, they chant, they make a pass at harmonizing, thus revealing the once-ominous tunings of sonic youths everywhere for the benign art-school move they are. No way are these songs ""pop""--they won't make little children smile or Mom pat her foot. But their sweetness is no less certain for that, and considerably rarer.
"
FALSE,A-,Title TK,The Breeders,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11208,"
Skeletal, fragmented, stumblebum, Kim and Kelley retain their knack for righting themselves with a tuneburst just when you thought they'd never do the limbo again, and they've been away so long they still think alt is a sloppy lifestyle rather than an embattled ethos. Through the imagistic baffle of their lyrics, they leave the impression that they subsist off their modest royalties, scattered gig fees, and compromised advances--mostly on beer.
"
FALSE,A-,Alkohol,Goran Bregovic,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14707,"
An educated non-Roma Serbian-Croatian popularizer who hit the big time scoring Emir Kusturica's educated non-Roma Time of the Gypsies, Bregovic is resented by many Roma musicians, and insofar as he's copyrighted traditional tunes I sympathize. But insofar as he makes the music go boom I don't. For outsiders, the unsynched oompah sway that makes Gypsy brass so intoxicating differs only marginally from strange background blowing that doesn't, so for Bregovic's first U.S. release to stagger forward on its own groove is an impressive achievement. As befits a guitarist who long led his own rock group, Bregovic's Wedding and Funeral Band is more purposeful than the Boban Markovic Orkestar and more unified than Fanfare Ciocarlia. Of course, it's also more obvious than either. But it's not like anybody's Gypsy brass is deep into subtlety. Bregovic reports that this is the slivovitz half of Alkohol, to be followed by a champagne half featuring a chamber orchestra. I expect to stick with the hard stuff.

FALSE,A-,Never Buy Texas from a Cowboy,The Brides of Funkenstein,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6459,"
Every previous album by the Brides and Parlet has ended up pretty quickly on my reference shelves--P-Funk was obviously expending ts collective energy elsewhere. But since George Clinton's current master plan involves sharpening his sidekicks' profiles, he put out on this one, and I prefer it to Gloryhallastoopid or Uncle Jam Wants You. It's gratifying to hear women asserting themselves in what has always been a sexist setup. Dawn Silva, Sheila Horn, and Jeanette McGruder generate funk power and cartoon stoopidity--next to Philippe Wynne, they're the best voices George has. Heroine of title cut: Mother Wit.

After fruitlessly sampling whatever Bridgewater albums came my way for 25 years, I harbored few hopes that this one would escape decorum, delusions of grandeur, and/or commercial confusion just because it was live. But it does, and then it keeps on going. It's funny, it's sexy, it swings like crazy. Long workouts on ""Slow Boat to China"" and ""Love for Sale"" show off her fabled chops without dwelling on them. The many extended scats are worthy of Ella herself. Even the gaffe proves her heart is in the right place when she's out there working the crowd--James Brown's ""Sex Machine.""

FALSE,A-,"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning",Bright Eyes,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12893,"
Given indie-rock's formal-historical dilemma, grant Conor Oberst this--at least it bothers him that he has no idea what he's doing, or rather why he's doing it, though actually I mean he admits that it bothers him instead of trying to ignore it. Like the empathy of so many young men, especially artists, his is more self-involved than saints like us prefer. But at least he expresses empathy--to memorable melodies that very nearly bear up under the repetitions his rarely witless or superfluous lyrics require.

FALSE,A-,Cassadaga,Bright Eyes,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13693,"
In a banner year for indie semistars such as the Shins, Spoon, the New Pornographers and their major-matriculated kin, Conor Oberst's emotional directness stands out. He's verbose and sometimes addled. But he's not ironic--only Arcade Fire go for the gut with such gusto. From numerous contenders, my favorite song months after they arrived begs for a John Legend or Taylor Hicks cover: ""Make a Plan to Love Me,"" which could have been written on his Blackberry and sent instantly to the career woman of his dreams--in about 20 pieces.
"
FALSE,A-,"The Blues, the Whole Blues, and Nothing but the Blues",David Bromberg,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16949,"
In the year the Rolling Stones capitalized their franchise on the cheap by mining the blues of their youth, who'd have guessed they'd get smoked by this equally ancient folk muso? Yet it's no contest. Where the one remake Mick and the boys shine up a little is Little Johnny Taylor's near-soul 1971 ""Everybody Knows About My Good Thing,"" Bromberg leads a livelier band through a set that kills the same the-postman-told-me shtick. Prone as a young hippie to the fallacy that blues was a music of old men on porches, now he digs into these lyrics as the sexually insecure cuckold he can evoke as Sonny Boy Williamson and Bobby Bland could not, adding a nerdy comedy routine to Bessie Smith's ""You've Been a Good Ole Wagon"" and showcasing the belated debut of the pathetic ""How Come My Bulldog Don't Bark When You Come 'Round,"" which he learned long ago from a lead sheet whose composer was too embarrassed to put his name on it. In real life, meanwhile, Bromberg has long been married to musician Nancy Josephson. They own a violin store in Wilmington, Delaware, where she's made a name for herself creating vodou-influenced beaded objects in a nearby studio. Ain't love grand? And let's hear it for art, too.

FALSE,A-,The Works,Jonatha Brooke,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14513,"
Solo and with the Story, Brooke has been a showoff and a bit of a priss. But setting unrecorded Woody Guthrie lyrics to music like the Klezmatics and Billy Bragg &amp; Wilco before her, she blooms. The strophic simplicity of Guthrie's songforms demands direct melodies, and the two self-penned ones she couldn't do without are touched by his cultivated unsophistication. This isn't the Woody whose guitar killed fascists. This is the love-seeker and poetic soul doing battle against dolor, dread and impending madness. Topping them off is one dated 1954, with the chorea already clutching him tight: ""Show me how, how to fight my battle in life/Show me how to fight, and I'll run away with you.""

FALSE,A-,Ropin' the Wind,Garth Brooks,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1338,"
As El Lay song doctors process NutraSweet, textured cellulose, and natural fruit flavors through a web of synthbites, a Nashville neotraditionalist thrice-removed wins a nation's heart standing up for the studio-pop verities. After scoring one of those songfests Nashville sneaks past us urbanites in 1989, he bet the farm on the follow-up and won over a country audience in the market for their own style of schlock. Here, Backed by apparently living session men as he imitates now Merle, now George (Strait), now Charlie (Daniels), he picks sure-shots from the if-you-say-so rebellious ""Against the Grain"" to the if-you-say-so soulful Billy Joel cover, and now and then he helps write one: the light-hearted death-to-cheaters yarn ""Papa Loved Mama,"" or the marriage counselor's theme ""We Bury the Hachet"" (""And leave the handle stickin' out""). Last album he landed only three; this time there are maybe six, plus a couple of marginals. Ergo, this one's twice as good.
"
FALSE,A-,In Pieces,Garth Brooks,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1340,"
His crusade against the used-CD scourge puts him up there with Rudy Giuliani on the ever-growing list of public figures who could have gone either way and promptly went that, and like Rudy, he wants the world to know that he has no use for the welfare crowd. Nor is his music getting any purer. But it is getting Garther, which means it may soon approach wonder-of-nature status--if there's anybody trying to stuff bigger emotions into a song, he or she is a lot crazier than this professional entertainer. As garish as their titles, ""Standing Outside the Fire"" and ""The Red Strokes"" won't convert skeptics. But that kind of middle-class heat is what he's about. When he calls his Baton Rouge honey every hundred miles, you can feel his dick throbbing--probably even if you don't have one yourself, which is of course the idea. And when he constructs a soap-opera plot about how an adultery connects to a random suicide, he enters passion's twilight zone.
"
FALSE,A-,Shadows on the Sun,Brother Ali,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12303,"
The voice is anxious--sometimes shrill, sometimes defiant, strong and articulate either way. The beats are soul-simple, not hooky enough for radio or dull enough for old-school. The rhymes are proud, thoughtful, searching, candid, angry, observed. Because Ali is married, he avoids nerd-rap's itchy dick syndrome. Because he's an albino, he knows extra about difference. Because he's a serious Muslim, he's a serious moralist.  Because he's a good guy, he's not self-righteous or judgmental. Two of his best songs are about fights. In the funny one he ends up with a bloody eye and a split bicuspid. In the indignant one he clocks a woman-beater and gets arrested.

Laid out conveniently on one infopack, the best of lesser half A and group B, with every track uptempo if not contempo (those electrothwocks are already over), and microstar C on board primarily to slow it down a little right here. In sum, new jack swing nostalgia--not a moment too soon.

""It's the Adderall admiral writing holy mackerel/Your bitch say my dick long like the strap on a satchel/I took me a capsule with no hassle/Now it's like I dip feathers of ink in a castle."" For Brown, these lines are subaverage. But they were playing when I decided to describe his writing, and instantly I realized that his subaverage was 90th percentile at least--vocabulary like ""satchel,"" vernacular like ""holy mackerel,"" arcana like the quill pen, six off-rhymes in four lines, the news that he spun them off on speed. Also, he raps in at least two voices--one higher than his Detroit homeboy Shady's, one so street-manly he sounds like someone else. By changing up the usual fatalistic dope-fiend hedonism with new verbiage and situations--I direct sex fiends to the cunt-lapping relish of ""I Will""--Brown's first proper album means to show us he's got a right to ""Die Like a Rockstar,"" meaning rich, high, and verging on bored. But two-thirds in it suddenly turns as bleak as his ruined city. ""DNA"" blames not his father but his father's genes. A two-song sequence frames the downhill choices of a middle-class groupie as the tragedy they are. And the social-realist ""Scrap or Die"" gives us the dirt on the hood's heaviest junk--scrap metal stripped from condemned buildings.
"
FALSE,A-,Old,Danny Brown,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16988,"
""They want the old Danny Brown,"" begins ""Side A (Old)."" So he executes a straight street-dealing rhyme like the ex-con he is, tells us how seven-year-old Danny got stomped by fiends on a trip to the store, and pairs off two lookbacks as convincing as anything in the hood-life literature--""25 Bucks,"" where his mom braids hair on the stairs for their supper, only then there's ""Torture,"" where one fiend beats another with a hammer and another has pit bulls loosed on her pussy. ""Side B (Dope Song)"" begins with his very last, yeah sure, dope song before dealing up some of hip-hop's most detailed porn--Brown is the rare rapper for whom sex is about pleasure not power, flesh not hot air. But the climax is ""Kush Coma,"" which is about what it says it's about and rides an eerie synth sustain to prove it. And the clincher is Ab-Soul's cameo on ""Way Up Here,"" because Ab-Soul is a top-tier rapper who in this context you barely notice. That's how musical Brown's flow has become since the sing-song boilerplate he started out with.

FALSE,A-,Super Bad,James Brown,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6464,"
Recorded live, it says--hmm. Were the strings that accompany ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" on stage with him, or did he borrow them from Isaac Hayes on his way to pick up the uncredited ""Chain Gang"" finale from Sam Cooke? But it doesn't matter. Ten minutes of super rhythm plus ten minutes of bad blues plus a surprisingly passionate ""Let It Be Me"" with the Jamesettes and you even forgive the bad (really bad, I mean) Albert Ayler imitation that he identifies as a tribute to 'Trane. In fact, you kind of like it.
"
FALSE,A-,Hot Pants,James Brown,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1639,"
Is it rolling, James? The hit vamp (can't call it a tune, now can you?) ""Escape-ism"" was supposedly cut to kill time until Bobby Byrd arrived. The title track follows and it's a killer too, one of Brown's richest Afro-dances. ""Blues and Pants"" suggests that the title track is a mellowed down takeoff on ""Sex Machine,"" which is good to know. And ""Can't Stand It"" is not to be confused with ""I Can't Stand Myself."" If you say so, James. Only he doesn't. I don't think he cares. And neither do I.
"
FALSE,A-,Soul Classics,James Brown,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6467,"
Brown recorded nine of these ten cuts for King; every track is good and many--""Sex Machine,"" ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,"" ""I Got You""--are great. But they're so jumbled chronologically--side two jumps from '71 to '65 back to '71 to '69 to '66--that it's a tribute to Brown's single-minded rhythmic genius that they hold together at all. Hearing his classic '70s dance tracks in their original three-minute formats, you begin to pine for the extended album versions--devoid of verbal logic and often even chord changes, these patterns, for that's what they really are, are meant to build, not resolve. And the chief formal advantage of top-forty strictures is that they force speedy resolutions.
"
FALSE,A-,There It Is,James Brown,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1640,"
A generous four r&amp;b hits here, three of them--""There It Is,"" ""I'm a Greedy Man,"" and ""Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing""--ace JB grooves. (Who's on congas, James?) The fourth is the ""King Heroin"" sermon, which together with its ten-minute offshoot ""Public Enemy #1"" is stuck cunningly--Brown has been reading his Alexander Pope--in the middle of the dance stuff on both sides. Plus an actual song, the first new one he's recorded in years, and a JB composition called ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" that asks the musical question, ""What's going on?"" For junkies, this is an A plus; for the rest of us, it's somewhat more marginal.
"
FALSE,A-,Soul Classics Volume II,James Brown,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6471,"
In absolute terms, Brown has declined on Polydor. Even if you don't insist on great compositions (never his strength) or great singing (where he's waned physically), he just hasn't matched rhythmic inventions like ""Mother Popcorn"" and ""Sex Machine"" for the big label. And this compilation inexplicably omits ""Hot Pants,"" which comes close, in favor of his ill-advised revivals of ""Think"" and ""Honky Tonk."" Still, eight of these ten tracks have made the soul top ten over the past two years, and not counting ""King Heroin"" you'll shake ass to every one.
"
FALSE,A-,The Original Disco Man,James Brown,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1641,"
In which Brown relinquishes the profit-taking ego gratification of writing and producing everything himself. Those credits go to Brad Shapiro, Millie Jackson's helpmate, who thank god is no disco man himself. Sure he likes disco tricks--synthesized sound effects, hooky female chorus, bass drum pulse--but he loves what made JB, well, the original disco man: hard-driving, slightly Latinized funk patterns against the rough rap power of that amazing voice, which may have lost expressiveness but definitely retains its sense of rhythm. Plus: disco disc of the year, ""It's Too Funky in Here."" And a renunciation of ""It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World.""

FALSE,A-,Motherlode,James Brown,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1642,"
Damned if I noticed ""People Get Up and Drive Your Funky Soul"" on the Slaughter's Big Rip-Off soundtrack, but for nine minutes it climaxes the instrumentals and vamps on side two of this revelatory-as-usual Chris White vault job, bopping along on some swinging souly-funk genre cusp of its own--not ""Sex Machine,"" but in the same worth-the-price-of-admission league. The spare, curlicued ""Untitled Instrumental"" is more like jazzy-funk, the rest just JB playing rough and getting loose in the halcyon early '70s. Which come to think of it is also worth the price of admission.
"
FALSE,A-,Soul Syndrome,James Brown,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6080,"
With his '70s output reconfigured by Polydor, this rarely seen 1980 T.K. LP-plus-12-inch becomes a valuable document: solid JB funk the way JB conceived it, or threw it out there, or whatever. Highlights include the on-the-one coughs of ""Smokin' and Drinkin'"" and the big-band ""Honky Tonk,"" but never mind that--this stuff is prime, so the groove's the thing.

FALSE,A-,Say It Live and Loud: Live in Dallas 08.26.68,James Brown,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1646,"
Counting the half-studio Sex Machine, this makes Brown's fifth live album from the crucial 1967-1971 period--and except for Sex Machine, it's also the best. Its chief competition, Live at the Apollo Volume II, was released a few weeks after it was recorded, but Brown moved so fast in those years that the Apollo record is radically different, a soul envoi at a moment when, as here, the funked-over ""Cold Sweat"" was his centerpiece and the daring ""Say It Loud--I'm Black and I'm Proud"" his pride and joy. From touchstone to newborn, from bop-inflected Maceo on the piss-break instrumental to born-again JB on the climax medley, breakneck intensity for the ages.

Never one to turn up my nose at a cheap laugh, I'm delighted to report that like the notorious ""Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun,"" ""I Like 'Em Big and Stupid"" (""What kind of guy does a lot for me? / Superman with a lobotomy"") and ""Cause I'm a Blond"" (""Being chosen this month's Miss August was a compliment I'll remember for as long as I can"") go after their targets with a fine lack of discrimination. Elsewhere on the EP Julie makes love, or at least it, with a space invader (She: ""That sure is a big piece of machinery you've got!"" He: ""I made it myself"") and fights a clubland hangover. Music's catchier than a jeans jingle, too.
"
FALSE,A-,Hard Times,Roy Brown,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3036,"
It took these five-year-old sessions, a good portion of what he's recorded since semiretiring in 1956, to open me up to the blues shouter whose crying, gospel-based style makes him a direct forerunner of both Little Richard and B.B. King. Most pre-rock 'n' roll bluesmen flounder through soulish uptempo arrangements, but Brown is so fluid he rolls along exultantly on top, proud to hold trouble to a stand-off. Side one is startlingly intense, and he wrote all the songs, too--man should go on retainer with Kenny Gamble.
"
FALSE,A-,Woman to Woman,Shirley Brown,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3151,"
Not a very sisterly exchange--this is traditional woman-as-supplicant stuff, as male-identified as it gets. And the songs don't have a lot of identity either. But though most of this material wouldn't work on the radio, it comes together on album. For sheer vocal beauty, Brown is in a class with Al Green and Aretha Franklin, whose creamy natural timbres hers recalls, though it's not as rich as Aretha's nor as pure as Al's. Where Franklin and Green go for baroque rhythmic and dynamic effects, to let you know they're in extremis, Brown's even tone suggests supernatural patience in the face of suffering. And the spare, undistracting Stax production proves that traditionalism has its uses.

The songs on Vic Chesnutt's albums are so good he sometimes puts them across, which is more than anybody can do for the songs on Widespread Panic's albums. But that doesn't stop the latter from touring or the former from wishing he could eat his reviews, and so this cross-inspirational fluke will probably never be anything more than the ace Athens oddball-mainstream one-off it is. Chesnutt provides the cocked eyebrow and fancy dreamwork, the band turns his strums into tunes, and who the hell is going to notice? Sure ""Good Morning Mister Hard On"" is really about his matins, but that won't boost it into heavy rotation. These days, the path of commercial expedience would be to make it about his banana.

It's 1971 in the streets around London's Waterloo Station. With halting certainty, an old homeless man--""tramp,"" the term was--sings one stanza of a hymn a cappella. Takes about 25 seconds. The stanza is looped, with ""classical"" accompaniment that grows gradually grander. In the original 25-minute version it repeated some 50 times; this CD lasts 74 minutes, so make that 150 or so. Doesn't matter--if you're like me, you never get tired of it. You hum it to yourself, murmur the words, eventually sing it aloud, unable to resist a show of expression that reveals only your own banality. Some complain that at this length the piece is overblown, but as a devotee of ordinary voices, I much prefer it to Bryars's 1995 expansion of the B-side, the ""classical"" documentary The Sinking of the Titanic. I'm ready to swear the ""composer""'s--really arranger's--writing never once obtrudes on the voice or the conviction it embodies. Even Tom Waits bellowing along in a star-time cameo does the tramp's song not the slightest violence. My only regret is that we never get to hear the whole hymn. The tramp is the true star, and he deserves his say.

Four of the first five tracks on this fat Canadian's Fountains of Wayne-scouted, Smashing Pumpkins-financed U.S. debut are the gemlike acts of idiosyncratic genius pop nerds are forever discerning on the recordings of other pop nerds. After that, there's a Marcia Brady look-alike with Nicaraguan needlepoint on her bed, another girl whose breasts he felt once, and a bunch of the kind of craftsmanship nerds swear by and normal people forget before the next one's over. But the legendary computer programmer, the predatory piano player, the ex who doesn't mean a thing to him tonight, and all the chunky girls who slide their reassuring hands along his ample hips are four more proofs of just how exaggerated reports of song's demise remain.

FALSE,A-,Man Overboard,Buck 65,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11011,"
Richard Terfry from Mount Uniacke is pushing 30 now, a Derek Jeter wannabe turned Halifax hip hop godfather who did business as Stinkin' Rich before settling into this professional identity. Connoisseurs prefer 1999's Vertex, whence sprang the legendary ""The Centaur"" (""Sure it's larger than yours I'ma centaur for Christ's sakes,"" which, by the way, rhymes with ""rice cakes""). But that one he cut in 48 sleepless hours; this one he pieced together gradually, and the reflection shows. Terfry doesn't believe in titles or track listings, the better to foil Morpheus and induce the listener to perceive his albums as DJed wholes, and this time he gets most of the way there. He's not deeply funky--more trip hop in spirit, even poetry-with-jazz. But the poems pack narrative logic and jokes galore whether they're justifying the album title, mourning his mom, positing a caper that requires divining rods and rosin bags, or assuming the voice of a guy older than Bob Dylan himself.

Where DJ Shadow decorates beats with words, Buck 65 underpins words with beats. That's why ""the echoing voice of the old ones"" includes substantial passages by Lord Buckley, Bill Cosby, Alfred Hitchcock, and William Burroughs. The music flows in its quietly sampled way, as it had better on CDs the artist refuses to divide into song-length tracks, but Richard Terfry's alt-rap wouldn't have much point if he wasn't at least as wise as, say, his compatriot Joni Mitchell--the young one, I mean. No question he's a nicer person. So here's predicting he'll be able to continue ""The girls are desperate/But the boys are even hornier/The rose is sweet/But the stem is even thornier"" into the productive adult life on which he's embarked. And that a decade from now he'll rewrite ""Food"" to accommodate the Malaysian, Uzbek, Senegalese, and haute French cuisines.

Since four standout tracks come from one of my favorite albums of the millennium, the Canada-only Talkin' Honky Blues, I have my doubts about the best-of route taken by Richard Terfry's long-delayed U.S.-major debut. Only it's not a best-of. Listening back to such worthy alt-rap cult items as Square, Vertex, and Man Overboard, I was amazed at how willowy he once sounded--a mere stripling, with a voice macho chauvinists could call nerdy even if he was a hell of a shortstop. Everything here projects his new gruff 'n' gravelly persona, including a remake of the best song in hip-hop history about a big dick (which utilizes a John Fahey-type sample rather than the electronics he has a knack for). Three are from two 2004 Canada-only EPs; another, the striking if overwrought ""Cries a Girl,"" is now a live staple. The collection doesn't cohere the way it should, and I still say seek out Talkin' Honky Blues. But wherever you start, he's a major rhymer, performer, storyteller, humanist visionary, and student of the DJ arts.

Timelag-wise, the 1957 concept is as if some '60s songpoet had conceived an album about Armistice Day, influenza, the Palmer raids and Mary Pickford. Only that would have been a milestone and this isn't, which you can blame on heightened aesthetic expectations rather than the potency of this Canadian rapper's literary mojo. Abandoning cabaret dalliances, Buck growls ""tenfold""-""Glenn Gould"" and ""go study""-""Mr. Nobody"" over insistent purist-plus beats. He's content to be a bohemian who knows something, like for instance who the ""know-nothing bohemians"" were. Beatniks, declared outraged 1958 square Norman Podhoretz, who would say the same in 2008 about Richard Terfry if he wasn't so busy bombing Iran. Podhoretz, I mean. Terfry's just bombing him.

Beholden to nobody's scene or purist myths, the Halifax-spawned, Toronto-based, Paris-savvy cult rapper makes beats his way--drum tracks of course, this is hip-hop like it or not, but with whatever on top, which here comes down to mostly female collaborators whose sonics subsume their considerable verbal input. Plus on two standouts 65 goes it alone: the opening ""Superstars Don't Love,"" which leads with a fearless three-syllable Jay-Z impression, and ""Zombie Delight,"" putrefaction taffy finished off with the glorious couplet: ""There's very little information and no answers./One weird thing is that they're excellent dancers!""

Budd's previous work with the avant-pop sound-environments king was a mite tacky--he tended to signify spirituality with wordless vocal choruses that reminded me of the Anita Kerr Singers, though I'm sure they boasted a prouder lineage. These eleven pieces are more circumspect and detailed, and while they do slip into decoration they're the most intellectually gratifying (and emotionally engaging) music Eno's put his name on since his first Jon Hassell LP. Finally he succeeds in making soporific an honorific.

In terms of influence and concentrated talent, this is clearly the most important white group to come out of California in the '60s, but the '70s haunt them. Jim portends Loggins, Richie portends Poco, Stevie portends Manassas, and Neil portends both genius and portentousness--ain't hindsight grand? This is a seminal record, the original studio-hopping sessionman El Lay elpee, and except for Neil's ""Broken Arrow""--which portends Harvest--represents some of the best singing, playing, and songwriting any of the principals ever did. But only Neil's ""Mr. Soul"" entirely transcends the professional care of the production.

Biz big boys of both sexes are besieging Doug Martsch, and why not? Guy's yoked his fully realized guitar style to material even more mature than that--how rare it is for a rock and roll dad to write songs about childhood that don't trade self-pitying adolescent sentimentality for self-congratulatory adult sentimentality. So you know what Doug Martsch tells the big boys? That he likes Idaho--and his family--too much to hit the rock and roll road. Here's hoping he can turn a modest profit while sticking to the essence of this decision, one of the sanest antistar biases in all indiedom. And here's hoping he keeps writing those songs and playing that guitar.

The holy purpose of Doug Martsch's songwriting is the riffs it feeds his guitar. Lyrics that poke into the tribulations and satisfactions of indie life may be worth excavating, may even convince us that for Martsch small-town life is an end in itself. In fact, however, he treasures low-overhead slackerdom for affording the physical time and spiritual space where musical epiphanies can flourish--for providing the raw material of its own transcendence. As much as Martsch's turbulent flow owes J Mascis, Neil Young is definitely the godfather--so that when Martsch launches a 20-minute ""Cortez the Killer"" you may forget what record you've got on until you realize how much louder Martsch's cannonading repetitions are. There's no folk rock in him--and, for that pomo touch, plenty of computer.

In which the mystery man follows up the Kindred EP with what is nominally a two-""song"" ""single,"" each title divided into silence-separated sections and the whole thing clocking in at 25:32 it says here. Background music it's not--while I admired it fine doing my daytime musical tasks, I only got it when I put it on at five o'clock in the morning, whereupon I discovered that its spooky gravity and deliberate movement suggested elegiac or perhaps even inspirational goals. Fifteen years later, the Alan Lomax gospel samples of Moby's Play are regarded as shamelessly corny in the techno world. I wonder whether the opening organ melody and very nearly hooky keyboard-ostinato facsimile that comes in around 8:30 of ""Rough Sleeper"" will offend ascetic snobs another decade or two down the line.

Two EPs from the mysterious William Bevan, six tracks divided evenly between his 20-minute 2011 return and his 30-minute 2012 stride forward, cohere almost seamlessly as the album they become when you don't have to turn any plastic over. The accomplished recapitulations of Street Halo--faerie electro-soprano and vinyl sputter-crackle laying their dream and disquiet on the nervous beats?-pause briefly at what is now track four, which takes seven seconds to achieve liminal audibility before slowly building into a peppier elegy than anything he's previously dared. And despite the lamentable title ""Ashtray Wasp"" (please, I don't want to know), the 12-minute finale begins as a distressed house anthem--not literally uplifting, this is Burial, but inspiring nonetheless?-and then trails off into something more lyrical. Thoughtful, even.

From Jerry Wexler to Peter Guralnick and beyond, the authorities who consider this minor hitmaker (five top 40s, none after 1965) the greatest soul singer or something like it delight in his eye for the main chance. Hawking food on tour buses, skipping the playback of his label debut so he can get back to his snow-shoveling concession, he proves soul is as much show business as sincerity or gospel truth. But maybe it's not so great that he can turn his talent ""on and off so easily, seemingly at will."" Maybe the readiness with which the man would sing country or preach pop bespeaks a detachment from music as a calling. These mostly New York-recorded songs, all crafted with Atlantic's staunch commitment to bottom and hook, rarely create the illusion of necessity. Smooth and commanding, hustling his blarney with humor and grit, he risks remaining just out of reach of your two willing ears.

Having put the omega on smarmy Alpha Bandmate Steve Soles (who does show up in the credits, but not--unlike the ever-adroit David Mansfield--as a band member), Burnett produces the best Christian record of 1980 for John Fahey's Buddhist blues label. Of course, you could also call it the best rockabilly record of 1980--something has happened to rockabilly since Sam Phillips talked Jerry Lee into defaming the Pentecost. And since Burnett is equally comfortable with the (divine) ""power of love"" and a (fleshly) ""love that's hot,"" maybe something's happened to Christianity, too.

Not that this is altogether unproblematic--as catchy and incisive as the originals are, as casually as they're delivered, not one jumps off the record with the unassuming confidence of the cover's pure pop. This is an artist who can't shake his own self-consciousness. That's why he came on rockabilly.

He's a left-field classic, like Hound Dog Taylor or Jimmy Rogers in blues. Unfortunately, this compilation, devised solely to take its place in Island's new Reggae Greats series, invites hair-splitting. The 1976 debut Marcus Garvey is more of a piece, which matters with a prophet of autohypnosis like Rodney; the 1979 compilation Harder Than the Best configures eight of the same tracks more gracefuly.

So as he matured he turned conversational, talking his songs out of discretion rather than necessity. Thus he established his suitability for that ""One Night Affair"" he hopes you have in mind.

Despite a decade east of Avenue B I've never responded to salsa, which is a quirk, not a judgment; it must have to do with my clumsy dancing, my lack of Spanish, my finickiness about horns. Even Grupo Folklorico, whom I love live and admire on record, rarely find their way to my turntable. But I play this for everyone I can. Cachao--real name Israel Lopez--helped invent salsa, and here recreates two phases of its evolution. The style of side one dates from the '50s and sounds more or less like the small-group salsa of today; although I appreciate the dynamics of its percussion, I'm not drawn to it. But the style of side two--which dates from 1938, when Cachao claimed the genteel danzon for black rhythm in Havana--I find breathtaking in its conjunction of restrained swing and elegant romanticism. Because it is simultaneously suave and audacious, it reminds me a little of early Duke Ellington, although finally it's more conventional. But Duke Ellington never tempted me to learn to mambo.

The way I feel it, the perfectly listenable 1959 and 1974 sessions recycled on Kubaney's La Leyenda Vol. 1 overdo the ballroom politesse. And though it's true and crucial that politesse has never been disrespected by this vigorous old man, not even when he was revolutionizing danzon at 21, I prefer this five-track, 30-minute sample of a mid-'70s attempt to cement his legacy. The ballroom's here for sure. But so are the Havana street, the African village, the dockside joint in Anyport, Terra.

So since there's no sign that his modest chops deteriorated or his ham-fisted aesthetic developed, playing this record of classic Scott Joplin creations and ungainly Brun Campbell originals is like tossing a century of deodorized air out the window. Ragtime contemporaries unheard by me may have taken a more refined approach, but Campbell's ingrained indelicacy yanks the arty veil off the style. The only good pianist I know with a heavier touch is Jerry Lee Lewis, who has more rebop if less technique and should go into training for a rag album of his own.

In synch with the historical moment for once, Beefheart offers up his most uncompromised album since Trout Mask Replica in 1969--never before have his nerve-wracking harmonies and sainted-spastic rhythms been captured in such brutal living color.

In this her strong voice proves essential as you begin to notice how rarely it's overbearing. She's emotive--has to be. But she's more detailed than your usual belter, because she knows strong voices aren't just for knocking folks over.

So I'm recommending neither the Pearl Mr. Music Master available at list from Amazon and elsewhere nor the Naxos Mr. Music Master available at bonkers ditto, which are different from each other and differenter from this modest '40s comp a Decca subsidiary tossed on the pile in 1970. Beginning with ""Darktown Strutters' Ball,"" the only one he didn't write, and ending with the thematically related ""Old Man Harlem,"" it's never been a CD, and although Discogs has the vinyl cheap as I write, I suggest streaming--from Spotify, Napster, Google Play. I picked it out because it lets Carmichael sing and play--brass is deployed to color or comment rather than enlarge trio arrangements that are often left to signify on their own, and no choral sweetening bedizens a talky voice that these days could pass for accomplished. Beyond ""Stardust,"" ""Georgia,"" and ""Memphis in June,"" the songs are light-hearted when they're not full novelties like ""He Killed 'Er,"" 'er being a black widow spider. In the title song, a young colored prophet advises some pal of Beethoven to ""play that rhythm faster."" Then he predicts music history through 1935.

They're classic country, classic pop, classic Rosanne, and though she's the decade's premier interpretive singer, she wrote them all. Their only competition is a Tom Petty tune, which suggests something about her musical affinities. But I miss ""Rosie Strike Back"" and ""The Real Me""--from a nonpop, noncountry, non-Tom Petty vantage the rest of these perfectly enjoyable selections seem half a touch too cute, languid, soft. And fairly depict the decade's premier interpretive singer nonetheless.

FALSE,A-,Interiors,Rosanne Cash,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3016,"
With husband-producer Rodney Crowell down to ""guest vocal,"" she's on her own. Not only is this the first time she's produced herself, it's the first time she wrote all the songs--only once before has she even come close. Musically it's singer-songwriter rock, though as always Cash redeems tasteful arrangements with high-quality melodies and intense vocal focus. But lyrically this prolonged meditation on a marriage in pain is country at its best, because country is marriage music and Cash knows the territory. Anger, fear, separation, transcendence, change--this woman has thought about the tough stuff. Most of the time she has as much to say as, to choose a random example, Woody Allen girding himself up for a big statement. And even when she's corny, her seriousness is so palpable that the emotional effort carries the songs.
"
FALSE,A-,The Wheel,Rosanne Cash,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3017,"
Cash's literary ambitions would be hard on any singing songwriter, not just a country star with New York on her mind. So while these evocations, explorations, and other -ations of life and love a-borning are prim by good American-music standards of process and groove, give her credit for evoking and exploring like she means it, which has always been her strength. ""I'm changing like a girl/On the threshold of her life/In love with the whole world,"" this thirtysomething sings, and you can feel it.
"
FALSE,A-,Your Turn,Ceramic Dog,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15975,"
Situated between the forlorn yowl ""Lies My Body Told Me"" and the impersonal slave chant ""Masters of the Internet,"" the title track, a wordless showcase for leader Marc Ribot's guitar, redeems ""rockism""'s raging glory days. I mean, these guys are pissed, yet without a hint of sexist strut or blues-boy self-pity. Six songs-with-lyrics, each with its own vocal signature although there's not a proper singer to be heard, and six instrumentals, some straight and some avant and one a loving yet crudely irreverent ""Take Five"" cover, converge toward the same goal: demolishing your musical illusions. Really, folks, don't try to download this one free. They want their money. When they say ""We're not human like you/We live inside your iPod,"" that's called sarcasm.
"
FALSE,A-,Greatest Hits,Chairmen of the Board,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6065,"
General Johnson has had a hand in more choice songs than many El Lay millionaires, like for instance ""It Will Stand,"" ""Bring the Boys Home,"" ""Want Ads,"" the Grammy-winning (and here obtrusive) ""Patches."" He rules Carolina beach music, living off club gigs and checks in the mail without ever venturing 500 miles from home. But this early-'70s group was his baby. More striking than his clenched throat or Holland-Dozier-Holland-approved hooks is the skewed guitar funk he bore down on after his secondhand Motown stopped selling. Since pop was his game, the influences are Sly and Norman Whitfield rather than George and JB. And if ""Let's Have Some Fun"" isn't slammin', my name is Rumpofsteelskin.
"
FALSE,A-,Barricades & Brickwalls,Kasey Chambers,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11087,"
I got into the lizard-slow ""Nullarbor Song"" only after determining that Nullarbor is the southern Australian desert, its name Latin for ""no trees""--did wonders for the ""river of tears"" line. That's the kind of price you pay for the saving strangeness built into Chambers's achieved, imagined stylistic commitment. Sure the outback can turn you into a country singer, especially if your dad is a professional folkie who's romanticized the natural his whole life (and you're not really a rebel). Sure the difficulty of the leap can mitigate the folk/country corn factor, especially if your voice is a wonder of nature (and you have enough sass in you). But represent your roots honestly, as you're smart enough to know you must, and sometimes you'll lose the folks you romanticize.
"
FALSE,A-,Acid Rap,Chance the Rapper,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16024,"
His flow a cartoon whine, his wordplay wittily associative, his affect educated ghetto, and his main life experiences rising in the rap game, zonking on cannabis and lysergic, and surviving a battle zone, he projects an anxiety that has recognizable cognates among alt-rock waste-os with a lot less to be afraid of. Amusing though he and his yelp can be, I like him best when anxiety is a mood rather than a subject, particularly on the quasi-political track hidden behind ""Pusha Man""--""Paranoia,"" an anti-summer song, because summer's when people gets shot. I also welcome the two-and-a-half minute ""interlude"" that praises, yup, ""falling in love""--and the one that proves ""Clean Up Woman"" is his favorite song.
"
FALSE,A-,La Radiolina,Manu Chao,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13865,"
What Chao does seems so easy that it's hard to believe it took him seven years to follow up the sweetly relaxed, justly beloved Proxima Estaciï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n. Maybe he's just lazy--it's not like he's a work ethic guy. Or maybe he wanted to do something different and took a while settling into what that might be--namely, a new tempo. This is a speedier pop suite suitable for dancing or straightening up the flat. The guitars remind us ""Politik Kills"" and ""Rainin in Paradize."" These are rock moves, you could say. Yet the deepest accommodations are with glitzy, synthy, militantly shallow Europop. Seven years after 2001, what other populace can a radical internationalist such as Chao hope to enlighten? Not ours, I'm afraid.

FALSE,A-,Dirty Linen,Marshall Chapman,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2265,"
So finally she gives up, living modestly if that off songwriting royalties, and after four or five years self-produces a ten-buck, ten-song tape that gets vinylized in West Germany, the disposable-income capital of the world. Naturally it's her best record by a mile and a half, because she's not trying to prove anything--just putting her songs on the table in front of the perfect little rock and roll groove of her non-name band. The singing is relaxed and aware, the writing sharpest when it means to cut a little, as on ""Bad Debt"" (rhymes with ""You haven't taken out the garbage yet"") and ""Betty's Bein' Bad (""She's not mad/She's just gettin' even/Betty's bein' bad/It's her way of leavin'""). May she glorify her Pignose amp forever.

FALSE,A-,It's About Time . . . Recorded Live at the Tennessee State Prison for Women,Marshall Chapman,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2267,"
She's a real smart gal who was raised to be a lady, and how she ended up in this godforsaken venue connects to the prison doctor she settled down with after a lost decade-plus of sleeping with guitarists and four years of sleeping alone. His love song is the only soggy moment on this half-retrospective half-showcase. Some of her references--jet sets, self-help books, money-making machines--seem beyond her captive audience's ken. But old charges like ""Booze in Your Blood"" and ""Bad Debt"" stick. And new ones like ""Good-Bye Forever"" and ""Alabama Bad"" leave no doubt that she still understands her great subject: why she didn't grow up to be a lady.

""Something,"" ""The Long and Winding Road,"" ""Wichita Lineman,"" ""Down in the Valley,"" and ""The Three Bells"" on one LP? Would even Jim Reeves have the guff? Yeah, he might, which in his case is unfortunate. 'Cause Jim Reeves wouldn't syncopate that chapel bell. Or chuckle in abject lechery and infatuation on some ASCAP oldie.
"
FALSE,A-,True to Life,Ray Charles,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5279,"
Charles hasn't sung with such consistent care in years. Not that he's given up his jocund audacity--two of the best cuts here are a miraculous recasting of ""Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'"" and a Bobby Charles song first recorded by, fancy that, Joe Cocker. But even on the throwaways he seems to remember the difference between goofing and goofing off. The first side is as listenable as any Charles I know, and I've learned to enjoy myself through the schmaltz of ""Be My Love"" and get to the easy stuff on side two. Now if only he'd let those Beatle ballads be.
"
FALSE,A-,Genius Loves Company,Ray Charles,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12498,"
Accepting help is a great virtue in the dying, and Charles goes out like a lion by surrendering control. The duet partners mean less than the producers--Concord's John Burk augmented by Billy Joel hand Phil Ramone. Their good taste can't stifle Charles, but it can protect him from his own weaknesses, which ever since he got into publishing have included songwriters who owe him points. Instead Charles picks songs for posterity, and even James Taylor's ""Sweet Potato Pie"" sounds like a standard. But it's crucial that Taylor eases the master's vocal burden, as do Van Morrison, Gladys Knight, and Bonnie Raitt--and Norah Jones, Diana Krall, and Natalie Cole, who's a good half of why this ""Fever"" is up near Peggy Lee's and Little Willie John's. Elton John and Michael McDonald, on the other hand, end up where Charles often did in his fifties, so set on proving their physical prowess that meaning gets away from them. And Willie Nelson reminds us that past a certain age even the shrewdest singer can't cut it on the wrong day. This is why it's good Charles owned the studio. He got do-overs, and he took them.

FALSE,A-,Kickin' Kikuyu-Style,Sam Chege,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3093,"
A Kenyan music journalist whose shopkeeper parents struggled to send him to college, Chege recorded these 12 unassuming songs in Nairobi with session men off the street and backup singers from the university. Although he reports significant sales, his profits haven't cut his straight career off at the pass--he's now studying at Iowa. So this collection is more Afropop in intent than in fact, and while we can't call it Afrosemipop, its self-consciously recombinant formalism--mixing, Chege reports, Swahili taarab, South African kwela, and Congolese soukous over Kenyan benga, tingeing Kikuyu vocal technique with ""the poetic intonations of North Africa""--is more Neil Tennant than Sam Mangwana. Credit its irresistible tune appeal to the liquid tonal patterns of the underrecorded Kikuyu language. Fleshed out with a brightness, quickness, and rhythmic complexity absent from the classic folkish Afropop it superficially recalls, this appeal isn't just rare, it's unique. Sweet, cheerful, full of fun--at times almost a dream of happy happy. Yeah sure. Song subjects include suicide, domestic violence, and trading love in on money.
"
FALSE,A-,Exit Planet Dust,The Chemical Brothers,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3528,"
They won't convert you because their main interest is pleasing you--pleasing anybody who's both open-minded enough to conceive techno as a bright sun in the rock cosmos and well-adjusted enough not to start star wars over it. Starts out whomping irrepressibly, ends up schlocking imperturbably, and either way provides the noise, beats, and basslines us earthlings like in our electrically enhanced popular music. Means nothing--except that pleasure is a function of somatic and cultural givens less malleable than mutants have always claimed.
"
FALSE,A-,Dig Your Own Hole,The Chemical Brothers,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3530,"
Their secret isn't technowizardry, formal daring, or Lord help us eclecticism. As with so many pop wunderkinds, it's spirit--generous, jubilant, unfazed by industrial doom, in love with energy and sound. Noel Gallagher only wishes he had their heart; they say more with a borrowed catch-phrase--""Who is this doin' this type of alphabetapsychedelic funkin'?""--than he can with a whole album of verse-chorus-verse. Of course it matters that they're not retro. But it matters even more that their futurism is neither exclusionary nor puritanical.

So, free""Believe"" and ""The Big Jump"" rock the block. The Arabian strings of ""Galvanize"" are augmented-not-improved by the tyrant-bashing rhetoric of ""Left Right.""

FALSE,A-,Brotherhood (Limited Edition),The Chemical Brothers,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14835,"
I delayed bearing down on what sounded like an exceptionally useful ""definitive singles collection"" because: a) I was never in the mood; and, b) I dreaded the ""DJ-only white label vinyl"" bonus disc. When I did finally return I found that: a) this album is great for my mood, especially when I can play it loud; and, b) the disco discs, as we used to call them, sound great in my apartment even though they were designed for, well, discos. I know, I like my ""dance music"" cheap--rarely dance to it, truth be told. But the Brothers were always the hookmeistering FX kings of Big Beat, as we used to call it, and though I miss ""Song to the Siren,"" this is longer and deeper than 2003's Singles 93-03. Leads with the only thing they've ever done that tops the Schoolly D-keynoted ""Block Rockin' Beats"": 2005's Q-Tip-keynoted ""Galvanize,"" which won them a Grammy with techno in decline and them not. You want proof? Next to ""It Began in Afrika,"" the best disco disc here is ""Midnight Madness,"" one of two new bait cuts. I know, the disco discs are probably cheap, too. But I bet when they come on in der club, fools flood the floor.

FALSE,A-,Raw Like Sushi,Neneh Cherry,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2543,"
Daughter of a Swedish artist and an African percussionist, stepdaughter of Don Cherry and the London scene, she's a twenty-four-year bohemian, a socially responsible hedonist, a sexy two-time mom--and a relief from bimbo macho and exchangeable female dance phenoms. Slogan: ""I know where I'm goin' and where I'm comin' from."" Alternative: ""If you're gonna do it, you've got to do it right."" And oh yeah: ""I came already."" The music doesn't quite rock one's house. But it's far more beatwise than the Brit norm, and she can sing/talk that song/rap. Bohos who sell--the most interesting kind.

FALSE,A-,Greatest Hits,Mark Chesnutt,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2257,"
Chesnutt's claim to authenticity is that he grew up in Beaumont like George Jones and cut a lot of dud 45s like his daddy before him--not that he came out of the East Texas that produced the music, but that he came out of the music East Texas produced. Forget it, Mark--you're Nashville. On your breakthrough single you hang out in the honky tonk as an alternative to playing golf. On your breakthrough tearjerker you only wish you could wilt as many bouffants as that fat wimp Garth. And on your best-of you put on your hits one at a time and see if they stand up. The tearjerkers deserve more juice, but somebody up there knows how to pick 'em. And when it comes to working-class hell-raisers like ""It Sure Is Monday"" and the immortal ""Bubba Shot the Jukebox,"" you're the bully of the town.

FALSE,A-,Risque,Chic,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=581,"
Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers proved on Sister Sledge's ""Lost in Music"" that hedonism and its discontents, the inevitable focus of disco's meaningfulness moves, is a subject worth opening up. Here, ""Good Times"" and ""My Feet Keep Dancing"" surround the sweetly romantic ""Warm Summer Night"" in a rueful celebration of escape that's all the more suggestive for its unquenchable good cheer. Side two's exploration of romance and its agonies also has a fatalistic tint, but in the end the asides and rhythmic shifts (as well as the lyrics themselves) give rue the edge over celebration. Subtle, intricate, kinetic, light but not mindless--in short, good to dance to.
"
FALSE,A-,Les Plus Grands Succes de Chic/Chic's Greatest Hits,Chic,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6575,"
Not as elegant conceptually as Risque, but a better party record for sure--in a music of six-minute cuts (actually, only three run over 4:42) a group this good has no trouble putting together a quality best-of after two years and three albums. Greil Marcus describes The Motown Story as ""the history of James Jamerson's bass playing, on fifty-eight hits."" This is the future of Bernard Edwards's on seven. And guess where Edwards learned his shit.

FALSE,A-,Take It Off,Chic,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=583,"
Despite their best efforts, this projected dancefloor comeback is a lot less songful than Real People. Almost as artful, though. The telegraphic precision of the lyrics, the wary solicitousness of the singing, and the spare, nervous overload of the rhythms all bespeak a black-bourgeois modernism that is of a city most blacks don't even dream about--that alien power center where even the best times seem to go sour.
"
FALSE,A-,Tongue in Chic,Chic,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=584,"
This is their groove album. Maybe their throwaway album as well, yet I enjoy it fine, because I get from Chic what devotees of Memphis soul used to get from Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s. Which group you prefer is partly a matter of which rhythms feel like life to you, of course, so I'll add that like New York these are pretty swift. I'll also add that their in-concert theme song makes me wonder what the live album might be like.

FALSE,A-,Quarter Past Tonight,Chicago Farmer,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17350,"
I'd never heard of transplanted son of the soil Cody Dieckhoff and you probably haven't either. But this tenth-anniversary double-live, 24 songs and eight spoken bits that include a tribute to his heroically supportive wife entitled ""Benefits,"" documents the Chicago-based singer-songwriter's sold-out weekend at the world-famous, 3000-capacity Apollo Theater--in Peoria, Illinois. Dieckhoff isn't as sharp as his hero John Prine--one disc at a time will do. But he's funny, he's kind, and he's preparing an instructional video about ""how do you get that drawl that you do--it's kind of a mix between a small-town big-city kind of a northernly southernly easterly westerly stuck-in-the-middle type of a drawl."" And if you grant that his DIY life touring the Midwest in his heroically supportive van is very nearly as hard as the lives of the fans he says put in 40 or 50 less colorful hours every week, he never stops thinking about class, which is why he brushes off an admirer who tells him that if he'd ""leave out the politics"" he'd move twice as many records (raising his nightly sales to 12, the merch guy in him calculates). Dieckhoff assumes most of his fans are Democrats but welcomes Republicans, and why shouldn't he--not even a Republican could leave a Chicago Farmer show meaner than when he or she walked in. And ask yourself this: how many musicians have the consciousness to employ the square, tired-ass, polarizing terms ""Democrat"" and ""Republican"" at all? Only some kind of northernly southernly easterly westerly stuck-in-the-middle visionary.

They're Brooklyn-based revivers-imitators of an early-'70s Peruvian cumbia-Andean-psychedoolic pop synthesis that loses an essential quantum of charm at a cultural distance--I much prefer the Roots of Chicha comp that got them going. But here they acknowledge their true roots with four covers on a vinyl-or-download CDs-are-for-squares EP, one of them a chi""classic"" called ""Rica Chicha"" that was the last of the four to grow on me. The first--by a mile, it's cute and militant simultaneously--was the Clash's ""Guns of Brixton."" The second was the Simpsons theme. The third, even more unlikely and almost as inspired conceptually, was Love's ""Alone Again Or."" Fun fun fun till Daddy takes the portable stereo away.

With the effective pop audience spanning 50 years and myriad interlocking taste cultures, early-'80s nostalgia isn't current--it's just a wrinkle in the gestalt. Nor will those who embrace B-52's-to-""Mind Your Own Business"" but not Euro-to-electro or Malaria-to-""Warm Leatherette"" be especially thrilled by these smart young things' taste or concept--except insofar as the smart young things are thrilled themselves, which in matters of revival makes all the difference. Sexy Malaria song, girls. Nifty new early-'80s Euro-electro originals, too.

FALSE,A-,Women's Rights,Childbirth,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16680,"
Feminist jokes over punk-rock thrash--fun though it undeniably is, it sounds suspiciously easy and unmusical until you compare the debut, which is both. This thrash is committed as well as pragmaticlly tuneful in the punk-rock manner. And these jokes are something else--insulting, embarrassing, pansexual, post-generational, and pointedly un-P.C. Subjects include bad hygiene, rich tech guys, Tinder, Best Coast, permissive parenting, exploitative parenting, teen angst, bi-curious etiquette, cocaine at a baby shower, and getting pregnant all the time. When Universal Republic assembles the deluxe edition, I fervently suggest the bonus tracks include the debut's ""How Do Girls Even Do It"" and ""I Only Fucked You as a Joke."" That'll take care of that.

FALSE,A-,Purgatory,Tyler Childers,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17281,"
This intense, narrow, flawlessly crafted retro-nuevo honky-tonk album gains decisive poetry from both Childers's lean, resonant East Kentucky drawl and his failure to shake his fundamentalist upbringing--purgatory, in case you didn't get the message, is a Romanist notion. ""Do you reckon He lets free will boys / Mope around in purgatory?"" he asks the Catholic girl he hopes to hedge his bets with, and damned if she doesn't slow him down some. ""Darlin' to me but that's missus to you,"" he boasts. ""Still on the road 'cause I ain't good for nothing / But writing the songs that I sing,"" he contextualizes.

Community regular, 30 Rock writer, and stand-up phenom Donald Glover brings more skills to the rap game than any pretender in years, fellow actor Drake included. His rhymes startle and amuse, his flow bubbles and snaps, his beats always get him where he's going, and on the expert pop song ""Got This Money"" he hits the high notes on his own. One reason hip-hop has no use for him is that high notes are his thing--delivering his rent-a-hook, Lil Jon sounds gangsta on comparative timbre alone. Another is that he didn't buy his $10,000 jacket by dealing rock or fronting about it over beats he bought too. ""Welcome to the culdesac this is where the street ends,"" he taunts, and out of the great goodness of his heart he spent years giving records away and then touring behind them. Right, he's too keen on proving something even if all the success and sexcess stories are true. That's why I like him best when I'm surest he's lying, which is on that pop song: ""I wanna feel you for real.""

His seventh hip-hop longform--including the 2011 EP and two mixtapes where he rhymes inconclusively over indie-rock loops--is his most official, on quality bizzer Daniel Glass's indie label. Unified by choral and orchestral movie music for ""the only black kid at a Sufjan concert,"" it's less surefire than Culdesac. But it's more satisfying emotionally, because the autobiography reaches deep: ""My dad works nights, puttin' on a stone face/He's savin' up so we can get our own place/In the projects, man, that sound fancy to me/They call me fat-nose my mom say, 'You handsome to me'."" Nevertheless, this black kid who got called ""faggot"" plenty--only ""spell it right/I got way more than two G's""--still wants to make sure you know how much he gets laid. Fact is, in a textbook case of nerd-gets-famous syndrome, he almost certainly gets laid too much. But later for that. Master of the alphabet though he long has been, his big message is that work comes before women.

FALSE,A-,(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People,The Chi-Lites,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3532,"
The politics here are imaginatively common-sensical, from ""We Are Neighbors,"" which adduces a racist knock-knock joke before noting that we're neighbors ""whether we want to be or not,"" to the title cut, which owes something to both Jesse Jackson and the Esquires' ""Get On Up."" And ""Have You Seen Her,"" like ""I Want to Pay Your Back,"" is Soul Music Meets the Women's Movement, warning any man who tries ""to be hip"" and exploit his woman that she's strong enough to reject him for it. I suppose it's only to be expected that this guy also believes ""fighting's for fools,"" a political notion too common-sensical to suit me. But at least he seems to have put some thought into the sentiment.

Like the Go-Betweens, these sexually integrated New Zealanders give the impression that they could write about anything they wanted--they choose love as a subject out of formal tact, because it's appropriate to the genre. Though they have more tunes than most--more tunes than the early Go-Betweens--what makes them stick is Martin Phillips's cracked, straining, nervous delivery, fit to break down with the next cliche (not too many formal tacticians write songs called ""Rain"" anymore). Side two isn't as catchy, but shows off a few other options--one song opposes settling down, another is pro. Bet they take a while making up their minds.

FALSE,A-,Soft Bomb,The Chills,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3536,"
As with so many formal coups, one of the pleasures of Submarine Bells was how incorrigibly it challenged unwritten rules (about brightness, concreteness, pretension, keyboards) while adhering to the ones you really can't break (about tunefulness, concision, savvy, guitars). This is just the opposite: adventurous on a surface that accommodates depressive codas and Van Dyke Parks strings, but produced with Martin Phillipps's newly acquired phalanx of L.A. sidemen in mind. Though most garage-pop improves when the beat gets solider, the hooks get clearer, the singer moves up in the mix, and Peter Holsapple adds a guitar, these devices are misconceived for the evanescent Chills. Even when they're all 20 seconds too long, however, Phillipps's tunes stay with you. Reordered to close on ""Song for Randy Newman Etc.,"" a living metaphor for the difficulty of his craft, and to surround the personal songs with the social context Phillipps captures so much more vividly than he thinks he does, this would be a worthy follow-up. I suggest a tape that goes 1-2-3-11-8-6-12-10-13-14-4-9. Skip the fragments, and the long dead metaphor for the shallowness of his craft that implicates a defenseless cab driver. Continue to foreground ""Male Monster From the Id,"" a Greenpeace supporter's bleeding-heart analysis of the sexual power play.

After ten years of falling-down flakedom only a cultist could love or even appreciate, Chilton looks around and straightens up. The bottlenecked ""Lost My Job"" comes close to such beacons of his lost decade as ""Bangkok"" and ""Take Me Home and Make Me Like It."" The precocious Memphis soul singer and the prescient American pop eccentric both get their chops into the Carla Thomas and Slim Harpo covers.

Even if Chilton approved the selections himself, his retrospective isn't what it ought to be--we get half of Third (with ""Thank You Friends,"" ""Jesus Christ,"" and other goodies left to the spiffy new Rykodisc reissue), the Lust/Unlust seven-inch (no Ork seven-inch), bits of the eminently excerptable Like Flies on Sherbert (no Bach's Bottom), dollops of mid-'80s spurt (no ""Under Class"" or ""Dalai Lama""). So you were expecting maybe Exile on Main Street? If Chilton had ever figured out his calling, he would have made a living at it; he's the EP king because coherence and endurance mean less to him than quantum physics (which he no doubt studied on his own when that dishwashing job dried up). You can't excerpt such an eccentric to anybody's satisfaction but your own, and even then you couldn't build an hour's momentum. But listen to any three cuts in any order and I guarantee you'll get off on two-and-a-half. A money-saving introduction to his self-abusing pop and Southern-hipster r&amp;b.

A woman in a man's domain, ""Zimbabwe's queen of the mbira"" here reorchestrates an instrument so delicate most Westerners hear it as a toy or sound effect. Neither innovation makes her a rebel, just a Shona revisionist adapting conventional wisdom to transcultural reality: by replacing the customary shakers with a band--another woman's mbira, two marimbas, and unobtrusive bass-and-traps for world-dance accents--she takes a gentle music out of the village without downplaying where it's coming from. I hear courage and tradition in her kind, playful, nasal-to-breathy singing, but not sexual brass, which distinguishes her instantly from other African women intrepid enough to run their own musical shows.

As postmodern lover boys go, David Macklovitch and Patrick Gemayel--let's get those sexy surnames in the lead!--are humorous and humane, and their songwriting has never been more worthy of Dave 1's Ph.D. in French lit. Never been catchier, either. The first four tracks don't quit--delectate ""Over Your Shoulder""'s A-cup sex object, or the ""Sexy Socialite"" they wish was a socialist. A sadder and staider Solange, whose light-footed walk-on gave their third-album slump a bump, passes her spangled baton to special guest star Ezra Koenig, whose two-minute cameo promises a boutique sideline in DeBarge covers. True enough--it's only synthy dance-pop with guitar embellishments, by Canadians yet. But what's also true is that the last four tracks don't quit either.

Their music and their anarchism combine the programmatic and the quirky. Despite the trumpets, many arrangements reduce to rock readymades with a march pulse, yet despite the guitar chords and drumbeats the enunciated lyrics evoke music hall. Really, they're that funny. You say that when they barf to cap each infinitely repeated ""Your ugly houses look so . . .

""I'm With Stupid"" isn't about ordinary people even if ""Dumbing Down"" is, and for the most part the tunes are so cheerful and the mood so up that the songs feel like jokes the whole world has been waiting for a chance to laugh at.

Speedy Ortiz? Solid, dissonant sound justifying jerrybuilt, obscure poesy. Anika Pyle's outfit is thinner sonically for sure.

Still, grow up he does. Church has always known how to write, and he's blowing here--check how the reworked title of ""Homeboy"" obliterates one's faint reservations about its moralism, or for that matter how the reworked title of ""Keep On"" mans up that sex scene. Jack Daniels (apostrophe omitted) and Springsteen (teen-sex soundtrack) are also title-cited, as is Jesus, twice--as a woman he doesn't deserve and a Johnny Cash imitator country music could use.

With North Carolina-based bassist-ethnomusicologist Jonathan Henderson by his side, Cissokho laid down kora and vocal leads in his Senegalese hometown before the two flew back the U.S. to add parts from Stateside folk, jazz, and classical musicians, some of them members of Cissokho's North Carolina band and others not. In short, the kind of well-intentioned cultural crossover that normally turns to mush or treacle. But this moderately miraculous album remains both chewy and savory. From the string quartet that complicates the traditional opener ""Alla L'a Ke"" to the sabar drums and female backups that fill out the equally traditional follow-up ""Badima"" to the horn and string sections that bulk up the climactic ""Naamusoo"" and the bird tweets, indigenous flutes, and sabars again that introduce ""Night in M'Bour""'s grand finale, a genuinely and often beautifully syncretic evocation of a double identity it would be hard to match and impossible to duplicate.

Not every high schooler who dresses gangsta just needs respect and motivation, but enough of them do to make a nice little audience base. The vocals are smooth, the hooks suave, and with age-appropriate overlays of sentimentality and distortion--degree-bound female imprisoned for succumbing to underage Adonis, FBI forcing another to betray her G for her baby boy--this gives those well-meaning kids a voice. If you believe the hit ""What Would You Do?"" has too much Ricki Lake in it, as it does, try ""Sista"" or ""Cats and Dogs,"" which have just enough.

Reconstructed from tracks created for such real-life rappers as Lil B and Soulja Boy, New Jersey beatmaker Mike Volpe's comfortably disquieting illbient glitchbeat chillwave whatsis will grow on you if you give it a chance. And because it's designed to back into your space, providing the chance won't feel all that time-consuming, preoccupied as you'll be with something more engrossing while said time passes. The opening ""Motivation"" powers home enough hummed 'n' moaned gravitas to remind you it's there, and the closing ""Cold War"" caps the 40-minute album with a vocal sample that utters the title for once. In between you'll first pick up on ""What You Doin'"" and ""Illest Alive,"" better known to you as the one in the middle and the one toward the end. Then slowly the rest will ooze into place via capillary action.

Since the indie-rock story of the year has been compared to every vaguely appropriate band you can think of as well as some you can't and also Wilco, I'm not the first to say Feelies. But Feelies it is. What sticks out right off is a drive that can't be taught or approximated. They're on top of a drone that crests over atmospheric interludes and hooks-are-for-squares songwriting even though they're glorious twice--on ""Over and Over Again (Lost and Found),"" which gradually elaborates a beyond-trebly guitar?? figure that could easily be played on a triangle, and the climactic ""Upon This Tidal Wave of Young Blood,"" which claims it's about child stars and is. It's also about Iraq. That's what indie obliqueness is for.

They weren't as extraordinary as people said then, so why believe they're as ordinary as people say now? Not that Alec Ounsworth knew the distortion he laid on the first track--which evokes a cracked ceramic cartridge, kids--would off-put so spectacularly. But though I hated the effect at first, now it makes me chuckle--a cheeky sonic joke that doesn't diminish the excellent title song into which it's integrated any more than subtler lo-fi hurts ""Emily Jean Stock"" right after. The debut was a groove album that moved along smartly before climaxing on a crest. This is a song album that sags in the middle. Groove to song--if you wanted, you could even call that progress.

Clark writes better than any other un-bro--better than Miranda Lambert, Kacey Musgraves, Ashley Monroe, Angaleena Presley. Every winning tune opens up or clicks shut with a few unexpected words--""There's so many shades of gray but this is black and white,"" ""This'd be a real good time to hold my hand,"" ""Crazy women are made by crazy men,"" ""Thanks for the Mary Jane."" And there's an added attraction--near as I can tell from NYC, the feminism is a notch more ideological than the un-bro norm without ever going over the Nashville line. Nevertheless, there's a neatness to the execution that I suspect compromises her credibility and have no doubt compromises her gut attraction. I recommend her album to anyone who's intrigued. I know I'll enjoy it again myself. But I can't tell you exactly when that will be.

As with fellow Class of '13 likely-to-succeeds Ashley Monroe and Kacey Musgraves, Clark's follow-up makes nicer with Nashville than would seem advisable. But where the younger women toned down their themes, Clark bigged up her production, abandoning the folkie decorum of showcase circuit. The opening ""Soap Opera"" sets the tone: a slightly overstated, unfailingly precise dramatization of Everyperson's appetite for self-dramatization. Soon I was loving the way ""Girl Next Door"" (she ain't) juxtaposed with ""Homecoming Queen"" (she was). The way ""Broke"" rhymed ""joke,"" ""folks,"" ""Coke,"" ""croak,"" ""yolks,"" and ""smokes"" (although not ""toke""). And at the very end, the way ""Since You've Gone to Heaven"" sentimentalizes her father the better to bemoan the decay of the small town she's never too pious to make fun of.

First side combines B's and a U.K.-only album cut from '77-'78, when everything they did was touched with the desperate euphoria of revolutionary holdouts, with two garageland covers, the Toots appropriate and the Booker T. a stroke.

At $9.99 discounted, figure sides five and six as a near-freebie sweetened by great cuts from Timon Dogg and a grade-school duo. Compare ""Apple Jam"" (you know, on George Harrison's All Things Must Pass triple, now there was a prophetic title) invidiously to the run of their dub ramble. Listen to Sandinista Now!, the promo-only one-disc digest Epic has thoughtfully provided busy radio personnel, and note that you miss (in my case) ""Rebel Waltz"" and ""Let's Go Crazy"" and ""Something About England"" (and who knows what in yours). Note that you also miss the filler and assorted weirdnesses which provide that heady pace and/or texture. Then note as well that the many good songs aren't as consistently compelling as on previous Clash albums, though God knows ""The Sound of Sinners"" is a long-overdue Christer spoof and words about reading are always apt and the romanticization of revolution is an inevitable theme. And conclude that if this is their worst--which it is, I think--they must be, er, the world's greatest rock and roll band.

The music is conceived songs first, an epidemic problem in current rock and roll. especially rock and roll as putative as this. And since Eef Barzelay adds the usual enigmatic tendencies to a voice worthy of an accountant in a Presbyterian choir (in Dubuque), its popular potential is limited. Nevertheless, the band now sounds both more rock and roll (faster tempos, straighter propulsion) and more chamber music (louder cello, weirder lap steel), and more is what Eef's somber tunes and noncommital wit inspired hope for last time. Metaphorical materials include ice cubes, Jewish junkies, Elvis's twin, a driving test, and a Joan Jett of Arc who burns her bridges in front of her and her steak at the Sizzler.

Since all the lines make sense, and almost all the stanzas almost make sense, you keep waiting for the songs to make sense. And waiting, and waiting, through calm, memorable arrangements that are never in a hurry. But they rarely come clear, perhaps because Eef Barzalay believes it isn't just love that's ending, it's the world, and what exactly is sensible about that? As befits an Israeli in Nashville in the end times, he worries about his relationship with the Almighty, so it's no surprise that ""Jews for Jesus Blues"" parses fine: ""Now that I'm found I miss being lost"" means what it says, with attendant explanations. The next song is called ""God Answers Back"": ""If you get everything you hope for/Then I will have to punish you."" Which really isn't fair. But what can we mortals do?

As someone who's always bought Cline's myth and never much enjoyed her recorded music, I can hardly express what a relief it is to hear her free of the glop that half-drowns the supposedly definitive Patsy Cline Story. The rockabilly raunch and uncanny phrasing her official work just hints at are the heart of these superbly remastered radio transcriptions--try the feral ""Lovesick Blues"" and the heart-stopping full-beat hesitations on ""She's Got You,"" respectively. My only objection is that the compilers couldn't resist turning out a document, and thus include her debut flop and suchlike. There has to be a complete live best-of out there. And the world needs it.

Cline's current iconicity (which for all I know could signal a heroic surge that will leave her as fixed a star as Aretha Franklin or Edith Piaf) is bound up in the vogue for pre/nonrock pop (which for all I know could prove permanent). Her Virginia twang mere seasoning in an unusually robust pop voice, she's Patti Page with guts. But the main reason she's remembered as the most credible of the countrypolitans is that countrypolitan was invented for her, by producer Owen Bradley. Entertaining the Southern folks who were her bread-and-butter--at maybe $500 a show, pickup backup provided--she was and remains something else. And this 1961 Tulsa gig with Leon McAuliffe's Cimarron Boys establish that the spare physicality and exquisite timing of her Grand Old Opry transcriptions are only a starting point. She could have used more rehearsal here. But the Western swing maestro led a band that was ready for anything, and Cline rose to their challenge as they did to hers: hard, high plains dance music, with her amazing trademark yowl at the end of ""Lovesick Blues"" a promise of the ""Shake Rattle and Roll"" she has all set to follow.

In tone, timbre, and timing, Cline was the best-equipped female country singer ever. Where Dolly, Loretta, and Tammy are all downhome in their own ways, her swinging drawl still evokes the fleshpots--Raleigh! Richmond! Washington, D.C.!--and it's hard to imagine a more intelligent document of her 15 months of fame. ""Crazy,"" ""I Fall to Pieces,"" ""She's Got You,"" ""Half as Much""--these are perfect songs perfectly sung, now remastered to eliminate the echo that once dulled them. But though she survives Owen Bradley's strings and Nashville cats, his choruses remain, and unless you're focused, forgiving, or a sucker for kitsch, their hmms and oohs and doo-doo-doos do her in. Essential singing and history in an economical package that was long overdue. Fans will love it. But except in research mode, I bet I still play her live stuff.

But like most minimalists, they try out new effects, and especially for those put off by Ade Blackburn's lockjaw, the variations in texture and rhythm here add jam to a garage-punk revival that's more solid than the Strokes'.

The same tackheads who've always passed George their grift. So here he pulls Dolby in for real computer games, thus convincing Capitol that he's reached the proper pitch of commercial desperation, and then makes an antiwar record with dirty parts just like always--except that this time the antiwar stuff is very explicit. I wish it included something as ingratiating as ""Atomic Dog"" or ""Quickie"" or ""Last Dance.""

That's to let alert consumers infer that it repackages 13 tracks from the first two We Got It 4 Cheap mixtapes, the second of which is longer and on balance better if you can find it. But broad-voiced Re-Up sidekicks and all, this one stands as a chilling introduction to Clipse's nasty little coke-centric world. Even the jacked beats share the Neptunes' efficiency-expert approach to two self-invented moguls Pharrell must sometimes regret he helped off the corner. From the two rappers' clipped flow--Malice killingly precise, Pusha aiming at the same target--to their analytic rhymes, these are two of the least likable guys in hip-hop. I mean, at least Plies is some kind of goon and Fat Joe some kind of glutton. But Clipse's smarts and purity are seductive in the manner of a Jim Thompson novel, even a John Donne meditation: ""I'm a warrior, poet laureate, May 13th-born Taurean, cocaine courier/So ahead of my time/Like Back to the Future but minus the DeLorean.""

Although his voice is lower and his guitar solos are longer, the idea that Dylan Baldi has therefore achieved some sort of maturity is silly. Come on--the guy's 20. His attack on memory isn't a young hero jousting with history, it's a callow confusenik trying to forget: that It's all been done before, sure, but that's the least of it. How about: Life is hard and then you die? Or: Old people have all the stuff? Or: I don't have a clue what the world will be like when I'm 40? Or merely: 40--that's two times 20, God!? These are all honorable thoughts that have required reiteration and adjustment for as long as I've been alive.

Where previously he wrote and recorded off the cuff, this one didn't come so easy, and it couldn't have helped that he'd taken on a second guitarist.

Limited chops combined with sizable brains propel these Atlanta girlfriends toward a minimalist aesthetic--postpunk in the angular Gof4 tradition that femme bands long ago realized left room to squeeze high voices in edgewise. The hooks are riffs or chants rather than tunes, and no less catchy for that. Usually these women are mad but sometimes they're sweet and often they're droll.

FALSE,A-,Somethin' Else: The Fine Lookin' Hits of Eddie Cochran,Eddie Cochran,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1124,"
Because he was worshiped in England, where he died in a car crash, this hot-picking Hollywood rockabilly was overrated in a pop world that had never heard of Charlie Feathers. But after punk, Brits forgot him, and soon his legend was reduced to ""Summertime Blues"" and ""Somethin' Else,"" so that these 20 two-minute songs comprise his first decent U.S. CD. I always found his catalog thin, but boy-pop puts it in perspective; it would be rich to hear some teen tycoon singing, ""I want my own Coupe de Ville/Make my dad pay the bill."" The essence of nominally rebellious male adolescence and as such, more redolent than Charlie Feathers.

FALSE,A-,Joe Cocker's Greatest Hits,Joe Cocker,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1722,"
Cocker's seven other A&amp;M albums are all depicted--enticingly, I guess is the idea--on the inner sleeve, and sure enough, every one is represented herein. Surprisingly, the past five years hold up pretty well--the vacuousness of ""You Are So Beautiful"" has always been the song's fault, and there's nothing early I like any better than ""Black-Eyed Blues"" or ""The Jealous Kind."" Ray Charles's recent cover of the latter provides some insight into Cocker's uniqueness. Sure I prefer the authentic instrument--every time Cocker hits a high note these days you're afraid it's his last--and Charles's intensity is miraculous. But the boozy, tattered quality of Cocker's voice, as well as the sense that he's about to break into tears, adds a helplessness to his version that Charles couldn't match if he wanted to.

FALSE,A-,City of No Reply,Amber Coffman,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17088,"
According to the official timeline, Coffman and Dirty Projectors major domo David Longstreth split as a couple in 2012, reconnected somehow in 2014, and recorded her solo debut together in 2016. Only then, album nearly done, their friendship/relationship ended and Longstreth kicked her out of the band, apparently for the first time. Having found said band's disquieting harmonies and shifting arrangements arch and self-involved even when I liked them anyway, I say no big deal. Coffman does not. But it's Coffman who gets the better of this meeting of the minds, fight to the death, or whatever it was. Compared to the labored rhetoric of ""Two Doves"" and ""Stillness Is the Move,"" the pomo lieder Longstreth ceded her in the Dirty Projectors, the one-dimensionality of ""All to Myself""'s ""I want to be swallowed up in an ocean of love"" or ""Miss You""'s ""Gonna take you on a night ride"" are formal coups in reverse. Longstreth takes a co-write on every song and acidulates the arrangements to excellent effect, but these moves are pop compromises by the standards of the guy who beat Coffman to the release date with a band album anchored by the immemorial avant-brag ""What I want from art is truth/What you want is fame."" By my standards, they're what aesthetes like him are for--the way his dissonances set off the weathered-porcelain grain of Coffman's lovely voice verges on the exquisite. Thus he's essential to the album's truth, which is that hipster love can be as ardent as anybody else's.

FALSE,A-,Songs of Love and Hate,Leonard Cohen,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2034,"
There are no bad songs on this album, and from Paul Buckmaster to acoustic strum, Bob Johnston's production fits each individually. I know, you wonder who cares. Well, I don't trust Cohen's melancholy anapests any more than I do his deadpan despair; there are plenty of songwriters both naive and arty, as well as page poets, with a fresher sense of language. But the poets can't read like Cohen, the songwriters rarely combine his craft and his maturity, and the man can really project. His bare voices and melodies shade in his tenderness and self-mockery (""I who have no need"" indeed), creating a dramatic context in which his posture becomes as credible as Denise Levertov's or Mick Jagger's. Granted, its uses are limited--best for late nights alone. Recommended to those who are turned off by Christie's opium fantasy in McCabe and Mrs. Miller but moved by Beatty's snow trek.

That miraculously intimate voice has become more expressive and confident over the years without losing its beguiling flat amateurishness. Some of the new songs are less than memorable, but the settings, by John Lissauer, have the bizarre feel of John Simon's ""overproduction"" on Cohen's first album, which I always believed suited his studied vulgarity perfectly.

A European best-seller from the Francophone capital of the Western Hemisphere, Cohen isn't the grizzled folk-rock parvenu we take him for. He works a far older and more honorable tradition, that of the French chansonnier, the singing poet who'll cheerfully appropriate any simple music that fits his meter without giving a second thought to how authentic or commercialized it might be. Because words are his stock in trade, Cohen's music rarely obtrudes no matter how classy or schlocky its usages. So despite what some consider a misguided attempt to yoke stark instrumentation and femme chorus, his latest recording seems no more or less natural/unnatural than his previous offerings, and the poems are his most consistent in a decade. Envoi: ""But you'll be hearing from me, baby, long after I'm gone/I'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song.""

FALSE,A-,The Future,Leonard Cohen,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2038,"
Sometime between ages 54 and 58, Cohen appears to have lost his voice. Where once his whisper was the essence of intimacy, now he's singing loud and saying less for longer. Which ends up not mattering because the music is his best since John Lissauer split in 1979. Even the instrumental is satisfying minor Cohen, kind of like the sexy stuff. The political stuff--the horror-stricken ""The Future,"" the hope-stricken ""Democracy""--is major. And the eight-minute sendup of Irving Berlin's 10-line ""Always"" is a pomo triumph: the hoarsely pitchless singing, the soul-on-demand of the backup girls, and the thudding beat are all travesties, all acts of love. At first you think, Sure, Lenny--""Always."" Endless love, just your style. But as the minutes wear on you begin to think he may mean it, and then you begin to worry. Holy shit--is this old drunk going to be on my case for the rest of his unnatural life? Would he settle for a lost weekend?

FALSE,A-,Ten New Songs,Leonard Cohen,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10294,"
In February, Cohen put out the presciently entitled Field Commander Cohen--recorded live in 1979, when he could still carry a tune if he brought his luggage wheels. It sounded too suave somehow, too sure of its next whiskey bar. But by August, well before history put in an emergency call for voices of doom, the sepulchral croak here seemed spot on. Breaking a nine-year silence, the first four tracks have nothing to do with history except insofar as history is in league with death. But they're as powerful as any he's written--especially ""In My Secret Life,"" about hiding from your conscience in the crevices of your good intentions, and ""Here It Is,"" about the ultimate futility of all hello goodbye. And although he couldn't have known how close to the bone the finale would cut, try these two couplets: ""For what's left of our religion/I lift my voice and pray"" and ""May the lights in The Land of Plenty/Shine on the truth some day."" Both beat ""God bless America"" by a country mile. Well, don't they?
"
FALSE,A-,Old Ideas,Leonard Cohen,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15585,"
So subtly that it takes forever to sink in and so slowly that reading along is a must, Cohen coughs up his first studio album in eight years, meaning his next is due when he's 85 unless he dies first, which seems to be his bet. Except maybe for Johnny Cash's, no death album has ever come across quite this somber. Since Cohen generated the succulent 2009 Live in London as well as the prunelike 2010 Songs From the Road during the never-ending tour that intervened, it's conceivable that he's playing up the fragility of his crumbling baritone to back that bet as the usual panoply of handmaidens provides soul, sweetening, and breathing room. But give it its long chance and you'll find that not only is Cohen's sense of humor alive and kicking from the first words, in which Cohen famously ventriloquizes for Jahweh himself, but that the final song is keyed to the refrain ""You want to change the way I make love/I want to leave it alone."" Naturally, what he wants to leave alone is left ambiguous--his feckless, lubricious, needy, expert way of making love, or making love itself? If the former, what's this ""saved by a blessed fatigue""? And if the latter, what's this ""her braids and her blouse all undone""? Eight years younger than Cohen myself, I wouldn't be surprised if it's both, and don't look forward to the relevant critical insights the future will almost certainly afford me.

Trust your Zen uncle to rehash a rehash the classy way. Although half these ten live songs are so old they precede the scam that cost him the royalties on his 20th-century catalogue, he not only performs them anyway but resuscitates relative obscurities, which in the case of the ""Field Commander Cohen""-""I Can't Forget"" opener have more relevance now than when he was a mere 50. On two new ones he's feeling too feeble to make love and too pissed to make nice. On the George Jones cover, his bass is just as deep if not as puissant as that superhuman's. And capping it all off is a monologue about the stages of aging, which he's copyrighted just in case some scamster gets any funny ideas.

A few weeks before this was released, Cohen deflected rumors of his imminent passing by telling reporters that he intended to live forever; a few weeks after, he cemented his well-earned reputation as an incorrigibly courteous liar by dying. Thus he transformed how these eight songs would be heard and remembered, and accentuated how shrewdly his living will's gravity, austerity, and sparse wit dovetail with its thematic and emotional preoccupations. Feeling impossibly frail and weary, the 82-year-old Cohen parried with a thoroughgoing renunciation--of Jahweh, Jesus, Vishnu, sex, and the acrid jokes he'd been cracking for half a century. A company of musical pallbearers added touches that hint at a consoling spirituality if you give them time and don't insist on actually being cheered up. But note that the most soothing softens a final statement credited solely to the dying man, which you could call a parting gift if it wasn't topped off by an instrumental track that reprises his most enigmatic farewell song: ""I wish there was a treaty we could sign/It's over now, the water and the wine/We were broken then, but now we're borderline/I wish there was a treaty/I wish there was a treaty/Between your love and mine."" To those literal last words one can only add: hmmm.

No bangers here--everything is thoughtful and midtempo. But everything is also strong and engaging. Having set the tone by rescuing a gorgeous Lauryn Hill sample from terminal sanctitude, he calls out a lost stepfather he can't stop loving for hating, feels a single mother with six years of college, and examines hip-hop's contradictions from three distinct perspectives, one of which is ODB's.

After a spate of productivity in the late '80s, this genius hasn't released an album in seven years. But the layoff hasn't affected his m.o.--through 16 cuts that go on about as long as the double-LP In All Languages, he's neither stale nor overflowing. As is his practice, he leads with dynamite: an opening charge, a poetry-with-jazz rap that fits together so well the words don't matter, a restful West Indian ditty, some rearranged Bach, and a gloriously oversampled collage that orchestrates ""unmusical"" sound into improvisatory ground. After which he spends 40 minutes demonstrating his undiminished ability to create beauty out of what would have been called chaos before he changed the world's ears. I don't claim to love it all.

Still a loyal brother of the P, he may not want to hear that ""(I Wannabee) Kissin' You"" and ""Yo Moma Loves You"" are prime Steve Arrington, but I intend a compliment.

About 10 years ago, I fell for these Weimar pop phenoms in a five-hour documentary at the Public, where they performed American standards and trombone imitations in the vocal and sartorial regalia of the finest Lieder singers. The effect is somewhat less vivid on this, their first-ever U.S. release--although their harmonies penetrate, their comedy sometimes doesn't. But listen to them gurgle in tune before breaking into perfect German gibberish on ""Kannst du pfeifen, Johanna?"" and you'll get the idea. Beautywise they lived off the tenor of restaurant singer Ari Leschnikoff, likened by archivist Joe Boyd to Edith Piaf and Oum Kalsoum, though the Klezmatics' Lorin Sklamberg is more the point. A Bulgarian, he was one of the ""Aryans"" who got to stay in Germany when Goering deported the Jewish founder and his two fellow mongrelizers in 1935--they were too famous to kill, at least in 1935.

But as a 30-ish look back at a life untriumphant because you weren't quite talented enough, it's superb.

You may not want to know that this could be the most intelligent disco album ever made, especially when I go on to amend that to ""intellectual"" on the grounds that most good music is intelligent one way or the other and usually both. But you must be told that the intellectual in charge is a Ph.D. named Jason King who's long been my boss at NYU's Clive Davis Department/Institute of Recorded Music--and who (now he tells me) studied voice before he went on to more abstruse pursuits. The idea is to reconstitute classic disco as a band music featuring divaweight vocalists--not the original heroines of a style now 35 years past its commercial prime, but their better-paid heirs, Broadway belters like Vivian Reed and Shayna Steele. ""Company freak"" meant ""house hippie"" in the biz's pre-disco days, but here, at least according to ""Theme From Company Freak,"" it signifies five-day-week wage slaves whose only recourse is dancing. ""Sexaholic"" warns them that alcohol can freak your life, and not in the good way. ""Do Ya Wanna Funk"" is a Sylvester cover that's even more uplifting live.

A few tracks drag and one or two misfire. But from John Lee Hooker's campaign song to the earned nostalgia of a lonely old Chicano who'll forgive you for driving a Japanese car, Cooder has brought his longstanding obsession with the Great Depression into the present, where it unfortunately, tragically, enragingly belongs.

Going for class-conscious reverence at all costs, Cooder milks his version of the canon from the Pilgrim Travelers to Carter Stanley with a double dip of Blind Willie Johnson and adds three relevant originals: the reverent ""Jesus and Woody,"" the worried, comic ""Shrinking Man,"" and ""Gentrification,"" which calls out two enemies of the people by name: Johnny Depp up front and a regiment of coffee-swilling Googlemen covering his rear.

Hip hop intellectuals hype the aesthetic of the new like Harold Rosenberg gone funky, so of course they snort at this dumb loser. It's not that he was sent up for check passing rather than some manly crime like assault (I hope), but that he favors samples everyone recognizes--especially everyone who's memorized the complete works of Tom Browne, either back in the day or by ingesting every rap record in the universe. Me, I'm glad Coolio did that job for me. Nor does it hurt that his smile is friendlier than Sly Stone's. Great black music past to the present. This must be paradise.

It's the stellar horn section (led by George Adams, Byard Lancaster, and Arthur Blythe) that calls attention to this album, but anybody who buys blues albums for horn sections has missed the point. Copeland boasts better-than-average chops as both singer and guitarist, not such a common parlay (especially among debuting 44-year-olds), but anybody who buys blues albums for chops has really missed the point. The point is conviction, more palpable here than on any new blues to come my way since Johnny Shines's 1977 Too Wet to Plow. Put across by those chops, of course. And quite probably inspired by that stellar horn section.

There are only so many places you can take the Velvet Underground at this late date, and after an overly indie indie debut, this cheeky Anglo-Punjabi consortium has found one. Sometimes the signature trick of spicing up the art-punk drones with Indian ones is self-evident because the sitar or tamboura gives it away; other times you sit there wondering where exactly they stole that rough yet perfect chord. Also included are found sound, lo-fi textures, various keyb cheats, and the casually irresistible Punjabi street tune of ""6 A.M. Jullandar Shere,"" all mixed in with just the right edge of false naivete.

Can you really keep body and soul together hustling chess and counting the royalties from ""Brimful of Asha""? Especially since the new one sounds a lot like the old one: casually pancultural, mixing ""rock"" and ""disco"" sounds, political supersmarts trailing off into apparent trivialities. R&amp;B sitar. Manfred Mann cover masquerading as Dylan cover. Obscure '80s Brit faux-soul reference. ""The Roll Off Characteristics (of History in the Making)."" Looks thrown together and thrown away.

Hip, schmip--Cosby is a genius. Whether he is creating legends about growing up in the Philadelphia ghetto or embroidering his own ordinary experiences as a parent or working for the Electric Company, Cosby has one great subject--the minds of children. Asking him to become a satirist would be like asking Charley Pride to sing the blues. His ability to delve the fantastic convolutions of the non-adult imagination has no parallel. Like so many of the most widely popular artists, Cosby is blessed with a style of sentiment that is never dishonest--Will Rogers must have had a similar gift. His albums don't sell the way they used to, but they're still very funny and this is recommended.

Because it takes guts to get up there and sing your songs, we expect toughness from the women now achieving indie-rock parity. So Greta Kline's fragility may seem cutesy or calculated rather than the forthright aesthetic signature it is. Of course she's self-conscious about the fragility of the fluting ditties that pour out of her body-that's-a-burden, 18 tunelets on parade on this 33-minute breakout moment. How could she not be? But that doesn't make her fixation on the romantic love she's so insecure about anything like shtick. Immerse in her tiny reflections and glimmers of self-realization and ask yourself just how secure all the 24-year-olds with tougher fronts feel as they fuck around or choose their mate--cynical or carnal, enraged or disengaged, you know they get scared themselves. Kline's quietude takes guts too--more, maybe.

Like his predecessor, Bob Dylan, this ambitious tunesmith offers more as a phrasemaker than as an analyst or a poet, more as a public image than as a thinking, feeling person. He needs words because they add color and detail to his music. I like the more explictly sociopolitical tenor here. But I don't find as many memorable bits of language as I did on This Year's Model. And though I approve of the more intricate pop constructions of the music, I found TYM's relentless nastiness of instrumental and (especially) vocal attack more compelling. A good record to be sure, but not a great one.

But from there to there is a long way. As Columbia knows, writing catchy doesn't make him a singles artist--for better or worse his LPs have gestalt. Including this one, I guess--it's programmed to flow, sowing confusion around your recollection of how past gestalts flowed.

To pigeonhole this as just another Elvis C. (and the Attractions) record is to ignore the plain fact that he (they) hasn't (haven't) sounded so tough- or single-minded since This Year's Model. Like Little Creatures, it's a return to basics with a decade of growth in it, and until midway through side two, when the songs start portending more than they can deliver, it's so straightforward you think he must be putting you on. But he's just voicing his pain and the world's, in that order, as usual. When the two strongest songs on a pop record run over six minutes apiece, we're talking sustained vision.

FALSE,A-,King of America,The Costello Show (Featuring Elvis Costello),1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1160,"
The Attractions always betokened Elvis's punk integrity--his commitment to collective creation, his rejection of the International Pop Music Community's expedient playing around. And the last time they were fully equal to his music was on This Year's Model in 1978. So finally he ditches them for T-Bone Burnett and a bunch of studio pros Steve Stills himself could get behind, one set anchored by Elvis I-approved L.A. rockabillies James Burton and Ron Tutt, the other by New Orleans-gone-L.A. drummer Earl Palmer and Modern Jazz-gone-L.A. bassist Ray Brown. And they all collaborate with their paymaster on that incommensurable token of collective creation, a groove. The wordplay is still too private, but the music has opened up: the careworn relaxation of Elvis's live vocals fits the uncompromised careerism of this groove as simply as 1978's raging tension did the angry young speed-rock of This Year's Model. Good show.

As a proud communist who's spent his career claiming the people are ripe for revolution, Boots Riley has at his disposal a rich, seldom-tapped seam of scathing rhetoric and concrete metaphor and fleshes out leftist analysis with humanist muscle and poetic integument. How many anti-school rants rise to ""statistics is the tool of the complicit""? How many anti-hipster snark jobs match ""You're the asshole ambassador/But your friends obey like Labradors/I vomited on the alpine decor/It's OK, your daddy's gonna buy some more""? But as he passes 40 it gets harder to deny that, ultimately, he's almost as deluded as the average H.P. Lovecraft obsessive, who at least understands he's on a fantasy trip. The songcraft on this hard-rocking hip-hop album is uneven by Riley's high standards--some are unclear, others longer on hook than wisdom. So when Das Racist and Killer Mike join in on the finale, I'm happy to be reminded that there are younger rappers ready to move Riley's vision worldward. Good for him.

Camper van Beethoven joker-in-chief turned Cracker singer-songspokesperson David Lowery was always too ironic by approximately 72 percent. But he's older than that now. The Californian turned Georgian pursues what musical career remains to him, lectures in business at UGA, and devotes much of his energy to his unofficial post as scourge-in-chief of a supposedly futuristic streaming economy that he claims, accurately, is ""unsticking it to the man and sticking it the weirdo freak musicians!"" And this crusade has awakened in him an explicit class consciousness often discernible in his songs from the start and just as often undercut by his snark. The Berkeley disc of this double-CD celebrates what might be called protest culture, lobbing stink bombs at the rich as it celebrates the lifestyles of the quasi-bohemian lower middle class. The Bakersfield disc aims for an Inland Empire country-rock that goes soft the way country-rock does but still sneaks a migrant laborer and a dead junkie in with the San Bernardino boy and the red-state union man, neither of whom lack charm themselves. Politics! On an American rock album! So much rarer a thing than the snark-damaged claim!

After several metastases worth of bar smoke, Cray's voice has finally changed: his singing is strong and unashamed, adorned only by his waste-free guitar. But what makes Cray a major artist in an obsolescent style is the songs, the sharpest often written by his producers. Dennis Walker is the obsessed sinner (""Porch Light""'s guilt-as-pleasure, ""I've Slipped Her Mind""'s month after), Bruce Bromberg a/k/a D. Amy more the all-purpose pro, though ""Playin' in the Dirt"" certainly feels lived in. And Cray, who has a credit on that one, gets all of ""The Last Time (I Get Burned Like This)."" Not since Moe Bandy was an honest man has anyone laid out the wages of fucking around with such unflagging precision.

Yeah, I could live without David Sanborn myself, but if you leave it at that you're refusing to hear a major artist who bends blues tradition to his own artistic ends as surely as Jimi Hendrix or Jimmy Page, a suave cool motherfucker obsessed with the male sex roles blues defined for rock and roll. No shit--his determination to bring his tradition into the pop present equals his determination to escape the cultural residue and/or primal urge that compels him to pitch woo, talk murder, and make obscene phone calls. Because this life-project can never end, a continuing tension stretches and strengthens his music. The songs here aren't as consistently amazing as Strong Persuader's, but all that means is that Cray and his writers are mortal. Summing up is Bruce Bromberg's ""Night Patrol,"" in which a laid-off streetstalker, tortured quote unquote by his bad habits quote unquote, joins the homeless legions whose ways he knows so well.

Where the misguided soul strategy of Midnight Stroll emphasized undigested horn arrangements and vocals Cray couldn't handle, this aims for AOR guitar hooks--every solo stings, and with producer Dennis Walker foregrounded again, every song catches. But the biggest difference is that the two have abandoned their evil ways--the part of the mean mistreater is invariably played by one of the women traditionally handed that role in blues culture. There's no point calling this a sexist sellout when it makes sense developmentally--the pain and cruelty of Cray's and Walker's songs always made you fear for their personal lives, and I bet their lovers (and ex-lovers) think it's about time they dealt in straightforward bull like ""I'm a Good Man."" The mood is penitent, full of pleas for time to work things out and summed up by ""A Whole Lotta Pride""'s ""Do you have to leave me baby/Just to even up the score?"" There's room for Walker's Nashvillian expertise in tragic marriage, too. But connoisseurs may well prefer the perverse kick of the band-written ""Our Last Time,"" in which an impassively disconsolate Cray watches his latest conquest dress after ""the sweat begins to dry,"" certain without a word from her that she'll never come back for seconds.

He even fools around a little, as if finally convinced that his guitar ain't no joke.

The rhythms are deliberately deliberate, and maybe the reason four different guys sing lead is that they don't really trust Danny Whitten with the job. But this should throw a good scare into Neil Young even if they moved on with his blessing. It's literate both verbally (Jack Nitzsche's ""Gone Dead Train"" is white blues poetry) and musically (they hoe down, they rave up, they phase out, they rock and roll).

Creeley was a jazz-loving ""New American Poet"" whose readings never softened the abrupt line breaks of his economical, apolitical, intensely decent verse. A poor musical prospect, you'd think. Yet the subtle flourishes of Tin Huey/Tom Waits/Carneyball Johnson saxophonist-plus Ralph Carney sharpen these 1988 recordings decisively. You have to concentrate, and if I hadn't been a Creeley fan in my poetic youth I might not have bothered.

One reason his debunkers can't decide whether he's ripping off Buddy Holly (nice boy, wears glasses) or John Lennon (played him in Beatlemania, wears glasses) is that he loves the music of the '50s just the way '60s rockers did before they fell victim to hippie condescension--not as living tradition but as living music. With its played-not-produced intimation of process, Downtown gets this unpretentious message across--this is the kind of album whose negligible songs can open your set. It's well-crafted, fully imagined. The commitment and understated sexual urgency of Crenshaw's singing make it real. But it's filled with the quality retropop his debunkers always thought he wrote. Even the pointedly mature ""The Distance Between"" has a fairly arbitrary happy ending, which you'd figure from the way it stresses ""When it gets right down to the bottom line."" Two years ago, Crenshaw would have glanced right off that tired trope.

With three covers, two written-to-orders, three collaborations, and just two songs by Crenshaw working alone, it looks like his muse got bored and departed for greener climes. But not since the debut has he sounded so at ease, so himself. The way he sings them, Richard Thompson's choleric ""Valerie"" and John Hiatt's lost ""Someplace Where Love Can't Find Me"" are kind, and Bobby Fuller's ""Let Her Dance"" turns into an I-love-music song no less awestruck (or womanstruck) than Crenshaw-Llanas-Neumann's ""Radio Girl."" Maybe his expectations have diminished so far that he's in that Zen zone where all effort is grace. Simple because he's simple--the second time around.

As for instance here: 14 titles recorded at eleven separate engagements, most of '90s provenance but two dating back to '82, including fabulous covers of Dave Alvin and Alvin Cash, Bobby Fuller and the Byrds, Abba and the MC 5. And even the ones he wrote himself will remind those who never fell for that wimp nonsense about his passion for great guitar. The man can play.

Although Crenshaw likes to call his g-b-d trio rockabilly, he's not above keybs, gives a fiddler one, and weaves in three instrumentals that are anything but filler-mood-setting rock and roll lounge music, melodic and contemplative. On an album that negotiates the awkward transition from superannuated teen to balding homebody, the two well-crafted infidelity songs don't altogether mesh with the two well-crafted should-have-loved-you-better songs. The masterstroke is ""Glad Goodbye,"" which passes for the world's millionth breakup song while addressing a much rarer theme: a couple, both of 'em, dumping a home and a physical history they no longer love.

This tribute record isn't designed for nostalgic old folks or curious young folks. The 5 Royales never attracted many of either. Yet without once cracking the top 40, they recorded more first-rate songs than any of their rivals except the Coasters, and unlike the Coasters they wrote their own. That is, Lowman Pauling did, and remarkably for a '50s vocal group, Pauling was primarily a guitarist. So here paying his respects comes the guitarist who co-invented Stax-Volt and co-wrote ""Knock on Wood"" and ""In the Midnight Hour."" Short on context for decades now, he proves Pauling's book is deeper than his own with assistance from such serial oversingers as Steve Winwood, Bettye LaVette, Delbert McClinton, John Popper, and Sharon Jones. Lucinda Williams takes ""Dedicated to the One I Love"" with Dan Penn manning the bridge.

Only it turned into rock-star bullshit in the best sense--the songcraft and tasty licks to which the '60s-turned-'70s have long been reduced suffused with their full complement of reassuring meaningfulness and congenial noblesse oblige. Crow's unairbrushed enthusiasm bridges the generations, and when she gets too bland anyway a fellow professional steps in to reaffirm our shared fallibility.

And in case you doubt she's a giant killer, she leads off with ""Son of a Preacher Man,"" which I thought Dusty and Aretha owned, and makes the sex sound like fun instead of sin. Cryner is a terrific writer--""Preacher Man"" excepted, the five songs with her name on them are the five sharpest, with the devastating ""You'd Think He'd Know Me Better"" her subtlest addition to Nashville's family values campaign. But the reason she expects to take over the world is that's she's an equally focused singer--even more so with Tony Brown inducing her to add flashes of clarity and infusions of warmth to her natural smoke and sass.

It's less archetypal than Two Sevens Clash--more general in folk hymns like ""Poor Jah People"" and ""Natty Never Get Weary,"" more specific in conversational complaints like ""Pay Day"" and ""Innocent Blood"" (""One year after slavery/The people were all suffering/From smallpox""). Once you have ears to hear, though, you got roots rockers paradise, all strictures sundered by studio musicians who angle into the formula more or less at will--chattering underneath ""Poor Jah People,"" or adding the trombone glissando that sometimes hooks the chorus of ""Natty Dread Naw Run"" and sometimes doesn't.

Not only is her imagery healthier and more humane, not only do her raunchiest rhymes ride her catchiest beats, but she's inserted a public service announcement, cheering on ""boy-on-boy"" action that'll leave both fellas free to fuck another day. Toward the end she even finds ""a new man makes me wet like the ocean."" But how about that--before the song is over, he dogs her.

Over a muscular bottom of unsampled funk--""NO contracts NO tracks with NO mechanicals""--the proud Chevy owner pounds home the plain, intricately rhymed truth about black folks dreaming of Jenny Jones, about hip hop going to hell in an armored limo.

""I've been losing since I lost my virginity."" ""But it's unimportant now / Because I'm unimportant now."" ""She's a model / I'm a motel / She ditched college / I don't play guitar too well / We're both boring girls.""

Better this big fat earworm, which translates crowd noises into music and establishes how much bigger the band's electronics got when put to the arena-rock test. Deconstructing and recontextualizing their tune stock ""mais oui,"" these robot wannabes bathed the unwashed in the blood of the synthesizer, broadening and lowering sounds that in their original substantiations owe not just Detroit techno but Ramada Inn lounge.

Two Nigerian album sides and four new six-minute moments by the 60-year-old singer-guitarist-accordionist, who in the 60s ruled Yoruba pop with innovations that made King Sunny and the rest of the modern juju possible--whereupon modern juju nearly ended his career. Then, in 1985, after a decade of mixed success as a hotelier and Christian preacher, Dairo returned. Inspired or chastened, he's learned to adapt, and though his arrangements aren't quite as intricate as the younger guys', some may prefer his old-fashioned songfulness. The two English-language market ploys remember his darling and ""George Washington, Marcus Garvey/Booker Washington, Abraham Lincoln/John Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King."" The Yoruba titles get the best tunes. And the album side ""F'eso J'aiye"" is modern juju at its most intricately delightful.

Better Nick Rhodes producing alt sellouts than Nick Rhodes claiming alt himself, and better alt sellouts embracing electropop detachment than alt sellouts aping rock and roll abandon. Clever and droll but also hypnotic and mysterious, with odd noises buried in the luscious mix and Zia McCabe's keyb bass as pleasurable as any explicit hook, they make their big statement in ""Plan A,"" which goes ""All of us sing about it"" for quite a long while before positing first a planet and then a message that aren't there.

After getting religion about a precursor of songless r&amp;b, I thought I'd revisit its modern wellspring, and wasn't surprised to have warmed to it--D'Angelo's concentration is formidable, his groove complex yet primal. But because it's bass-driven rather than voice-led, Brown Sugar is less subtle than Al Green Is Love, and less sociable too: D'Angelo, who was leading a great band throughthese songs by 2000, laid down all the instruments on four tracks and on two others brought in only co-producer Bob Power's guitar, which loosens things up nicely, though not like the string section on ""Cruisin'""--a tune that originated with a pretty darn good songwriter named Smokey.

Forget the Prince and Marvin stuff--this deeply brave and pretentious record signifies like a cross between lesser Tricky and Sly's Riot Goin' On. Accepting his deficiencies in the tune-and-hook department, he leads from strength, a feel for bass more disquieting than bootalicious. His lyrical focus is the social as spiritual, which he ponders honestly and seriously and sometimes bravely, as on the unjudgmental, unsentimental ""The Line,"" in which a young black man lays out the reasons he's ready to die--leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it. So the pecs and pubes of the video are a feint, one of many; although the music can be sexy and funky and fun and woman-centered, that's just part of the sonic concept. Which is unique. Play it five years from now, when the follow-up comes out, and you'll recognize it instantly.

Comparisons to Sly's There's a Riot Goin' On pertain--like that end-of-year funk bombshell, this music is disruptive, a little forbidding. But a-b the two albums and recall or discover how much cleaner music was supposed to sound in 1971. Proudly antidigital though he may be, D'Angelo knows damn well that he's competing in a funk soundscape epitomized for the nonce by the dense computerized pastiche of Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy--a soundscape in which gearhead murk and gorgeous complexity coexist a tweak or two apart. His response, almost as far from Voodoo as Riot was from Stand!, is a thick, sui generis jazz-funk in which Questlove and Pino Palladino avant around with the kind of bottom they already change up as flexibly as anyone in the pop sphere while guitarist Isaiah Sharkey and horn maestro Roy Hargrove interject from the jazz side. Instrumentally, it's more virtuosic, more surprising, more conceptual, and more physical than Riot's ""Africa"" jams. But D'Angelo isn't just being conceptual when he buries his murmurs, moans, pleas, regrets, and imprecations so deep in the mix that the words are indecipherable, because not a song here stands as tall as ""Family Affair,"" ""Just Like a Baby,"" or ""You Caught Me Smilin'."" Which is to say that the talk about how profoundly D'Angelo articulates his racial awareness and romantic struggle is mostly guff, although both are certainly present. I'm very glad this album finally came. But I also very much hope there are more. Because it's distinctly possible that he has more to tell us.

D'Arby's worst lines are so bad they tempt you to believe he'll never straighten out, but in fact there are three or four superb lyrics here, led by ""Billy Don't Fall,"" humbly literal in the face of difference and death. And even at its most forced the music proves D'Arby a master of the black spectrum from the trad r&amp;b of ""I'll Be Alright"" to the reconstructed Prince-funk of ""This Side of Love""--even though psychedelic pop is just as much the album's category.

Recall if you can the pop-jazz shadings of Dorothy Masuka, and note the three inevitable and excellent Mahlathini tracks--where the Queens compete with the witch doctor, the Sisters stay as sweet as they are.

Just like albums you pay for, both 2010 mixtapes from the Queens-W'burg-Wesleyan duo of color are seriously front-loaded, tailing off to scattered cherry bombs after half a dozen Roman candles. But on this debut (already hard to find, so get on it), the default electro loops sometimes reduce their unfailingly clever rhymes to merely clever free associations. Lines like ""Hugo Chavez""'s ""W.E.B. DuBois/We be de boyz"" are worth hearing in any context, and partly as a result, ""Hugo Chavez"" is above the median anyway. But it's not the wicked ""Fake Patois,"" which is even funnier as well as deeper than the super-catchy and more frequently cited cellphone-culture song masquerading as a fast-food song, ""Combination Pizza Hit and Taco Bell.""

And not only do these two studio rats know the follies of their chosen profession, they don't romanticize them much--or else they romanticize them effectively, which is even rarer. Put it all together and maybe you end up with another piece of beautiful-loser mythology.

If this historic set is about any one thing it's electric-meets-acoustic: the theme of the twenty-seven-minute title side, in which Miles's horn combines with an electric instrument for a two-note motif that's suddenly resolved after a dozen repetitions in a single echoed trumpet blat, says it all. But it's not about any one thing--it's a brilliant wash of ideas, so many ideas that it leaves an unfocused impression. That's probably why I don't return to it as I do to the quieter electric-meets-acoustic of In a Silent Way, although maybe it's just that this one rocks less--three different percussionists replace Tony Williams, whose steady pulse is put aside for the subtle shades of Latin and funk polyrhythm that never gather the requisite fervor.

The sitar-and-tamboura interlude that untracks the gently loping ""Great Expectations"" about two-thirds of the way through is typical of the album's failures--the only side that doesn't wind down prematurely is ""Lonely Fire,"" which after meandering at the beginning develops into lyrical mood music reminiscent in spirit and fundamental intent of Sketches of Spain.

Wailing through ""Directions"" or blasting the blues from out ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,"" Chick Corea's keybs sound more audacious and grounded than they ever will again, with an uncommonly muscular Miles challenging his facility and fledgling soprano whiz Steve Grossman mimicking it.

Solo or in tandem, neither the easygoing Peter Holsapple nor the lapidary Chris Stamey has put his hand to an album nearly as good as drummer Will Rigby's 2002 Paradoxaholic since Reagan was president. They've sounded stiff, tired, twee. But although it's nice to have Rigby's drive (and his hickster kissoff ditty) dirtying up this reunion, motor problems weren't what sunk H&amp;S's 2009 Here and Now with Jon Wurster in the drum chair. And in 2012, it's like H&amp;S never went away. The difference could be parallel life changes or the luck of the songwriting draw or even what never seems to work in the reunion hustle, pride in the band brand. But it's unmistakable. As ever, Holsapple's songs have more life than Stamey's, with the lead ""That Time Is Gone"" a song about finality a 25-year-old could get behind that's as rousing as anything in their book. But dreamy Stamey has just as much right to a premonitions-of-death title closer a 15-year-old could get behind.

Their jokes can be obvious (""Tiny Town"") or tasteless (""Takin' Retards to the Zoo"") or backbitingly sophomoric (""Bitchin' Camaro"") as well as wildly unexpected--up with swordfish, down with sole, fuck Charles Nelson Reilly. Either way, they're the young snots of the year hands down, and either way they'll make you laugh.

The Kills, Queens of the Stone Age, the Raconteurs, and the White Stripes are all staunchly schematic bands. They put their stamp on the simplistic and the emotive by formalizing them. Here, under the firm hand of Jack White, representatives from each let their ya-yas out, obscuring their minor deficiencies of songcraft in an expressionistic roil of sound. White's drums duke it out with Dean Fertita's guitar, mostly below the belt. Alison Mosshart doffs her s&amp;m drag to suffer and yelp. Jack Lawrence plays bass. Fierce.

Two-grrrl guitar-and drums, except that it's rock not punk--the guitars thick, the tunes sticky, the tempos merely up, the politics ""I'm gonna do what I wanna/Do it 'cause I wanna."" Feel don't think, they advise; value your bitterness, value your rage. Only they're also grrrl-smart, and sensible to boot. They know teens turn 25, then 35, eventually 85; they know sometimes that guy you want to go down on may think he can video you while you're at it. The guy of theirs I identify with is ""Julian,"" to whom they extend their sincere regrets: ""You've caught me at the wrong time."" Check back in six months, pal. She might be worth the wait.

Outtake EPs aren't normally where flawed talents come to fruition, and descriptions of one's inability to love aren't normally ruddier than the cherry and riper than the merry month of June. But though Ben Gibbard has self-lacerated before, here he actually seems to have something to get off his chest. Rock-or-die drums power the slow song as well as three atypically fast ones, and, after a Vegas-hookup prelude, Gibbard gets down to cases so unsparingly you'd think he was mad at himself. There's even a mirror metaphor you can look in the eye.

So maybe how you explain these guys is this: the Gravediggaz grow up--or get serious, which is not necessarily the same thing. Either way, who knows how they'll keep on keeping on--nonstop rage wears out fast even when it's mixed with the humor obsessives like this deny themselves. But on their third album in 18 months, independently released online with an obscene downloadable cover because the major they suckered into a contract refused to put it out so soon after the last one, synth maestro Flatlander adjusts one of the most compelling aural signatures in electronic beat music. There's more space in these tracks, and unlikely hints of sweetening both orchestral and distaff that come as laugh moments whether the lunatics running the asylum think they're funny or not. Their weak spot is sex, a theme that imbued with their rage occasions misogynist spew crueler and stupider than their parricidal spew. Were they really to grow up they'd sidestep it altogether. Or else get funnier as if they meant it.

Nobody comes out and says Skrillex-as-Unabomber or Skrillex-sans-fun because Skrillex is uncool. But that's what it is: aggro keyboards by Andy Morin d/b/a Flatlander, spitfire raps by MC Ride d/b/a Stefan Burnett, and crazed drumming by Zach Hill d/b/a you-know-him-from-Hella. Hill gets the attention because you (may) know him from Hella, and also because he's always been a hyperactive math-rocker who carries many slide rules. But the key to this triad is Morin, known if at all as one of Hella's engineers. Excoriating as Burnett and Hill are, the real abrasive is Flatlander--the shrieking trills that attack from above toward the end of ""The Fever (Aye Aye),"" the armored vehicle gone haywire that is ""System Blower."" As for what exactly Burnett's so mad about, the booklet that comes with the physical is a great help, and anyway, why ask? In case you hadn't noticed, the title's a metonym for postmodern capitalism.

FALSE,A-,"Heart, Mind and Soul",El DeBarge,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1135,"
The great lost love man enlists Babyface (five songs, four jumpy), Jermaine Dupri (one trick groove), various siblings (backing up his ballads), and the shade of Marvin Gaye (self-penned title finale) in an overdue quest for his own genius. The incomparable In a Special Way was 1983, and those hung up on the irretrievable innocence and naturalness of the past may take offense at the digital aesthetic, not to mention El's occasional descent into a manly tenor. Me, I applaud his appetite for the freaky, and note fondly that he adores her for it in the morning, as dogged as ever in his helpless devotion. I urge him to find more harmony work for Bunny and the others. But this is his second-best album.
"
FALSE,A-,Second Chance,El DeBarge,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15277,"
This minor genius peaked pre-1985 as the reason for being of the family harmony group DeBarge, which also gave the world ex-con lite Chico DeBarge and Janet Jackson annulment survivor James DeBarge. Although he hung on solo for a while, in this century his chief creative outlet has been the police blotter. But a minor genius he remains, and here he conquers the demon cocaine with a little help from the opiate of the people and records his first solo album since 1994 with a little help from the keeper of Geffen Records' flickering flame. It may bore or offend Babyface diehards. But those with a tolerance for prefab promises and schlock choruses won't care that the songs are the same old hyperromantic BS as long as his tenor remains intact. And though he turns 50 in 2011, it's unspoiled. DeBarge's special gift has always been combining the boyish innocence of J5-era Michael Jackson with intimations of physical congress. The quirky murmurs, yelps, and coos of his head voice, a high end of unequalled softness and give, sound responsive where Jackson's sound willed. There's a girl there, or just as likely a grown woman. And whether or not El seems manly to you, he's turning her on and vice versa.

Four harmonizing siblings, and if you think Berry's been here before, you're a lot less than 80 percent right. For one thing Berry's not calling the shots--they produce, they write, they even play (supposedly). Not too long on substance in those departments, I admit, but young adults who sing with the grace of children don't just get away with flight fantastic--when they fly as high and free as Bunny (who's a girl) and Eldra (who isn't), it's their destiny.

Smart young people have been telling me about this band since 2007, and I've been shrugging just as long. Give their big breakthrough a few plays and, unless you're the right kind of smart young person, you'll shrug too. Though you'll notice some tunes and also toward the end some committed tenor sax, and though there are those who praise its OK lyrics, it's still an arty indie-rock texturama. Only then give it more time than seems altogether fair and you'll find that this texturama has sufficient structure to assure that eventually the tunes and then the saxophone and then even the sound effects will signify and lift you up. Conceive it as DJ electronica that makes its point, starting all partial and halting before gathering itself to a properly modest climax. Except that it's played by a live band. And has OK lyrics. Smart, nothing--pretty darned intelligent.

Intensified by 24-year-old Rhode Islander John McCauley's old-as-the-hills croak and bodied up by a couple years playing out, the band sound grabs you--these are the rare young men who not only admire roots music but know it carnally. The source of the attraction does arouse suspicion--no songwriter should claim that ""not a single word speaks for my rambling around."" But the likes of ""Little White Lies"" (lost love as spirit death), ""Straight Into a Storm"" (found love as rock and roll life), and ""Song About a Man"" (grandpa) translate perfectly into their long-diddled dialect.

But it's sure the right course correction for guys who've always fetishized the eternal old-timey more than any band from goddamn Providence should. There's release along the lines of ""I don't care if you puke in my ride/Let's all go to the bar/Baby just as long as you take your piss outside/Let's all go to the bar."" And on drummer Dennis Ryan's ""Clownin' Around"" there's an equally satisfying release from heroin, the closet, child abuse, or some combination of the three--maybe prison, maybe death, maybe hell.

The classic is ""S.M.F.,"" which stands for Shitty Music Festival. May they end their Bonnaroo set with it.

In which a Paris-born, California-raised, NYC-based journeyman translates and performs definitive French chansonnier Georges Brassens. Absent Brassens' vocal brass and the actual phonemes he set his music to, you might expect a passable revivalist facsimile. But though the French has to be chewier, half these exercises in street philosophy and real-life parable give up bite enough in de Gaillande's intricate English--""Ninety-Five Percent,"" which is how often sex bores her, or ""Don Juan,"" one of an unmatched group of unsung heroes. Even more important, Brassens was the rare music-second guy whose verbal blueprints laid out melodies that stand up on their own, and de Gaillande's diligence about following their syllabic patterns preserves tunes that will snake through your head days later. Since the problem with chansonniers is the words-first thing, which prevents them from signifying across linguistic barriers, de Gaillande has performed a major service. I wonder whether Arto Lindsay could do the same for Caetano Veloso.

Basically this is an English folk band doing lots of ""trad. arr.""--""Soldiers Joy,"" ""Bonaparte's Retreat,"" ""Farther Along,"" ""Freight Train."" But though the instrumentation is pretty conventional right down to the electric guitar, the sound is unique, probably because Mama Josie brings a little bit of South Molucca (in Indonesia, where she grew up) to her guitar (and bodhran), and the kids learned at both parents' knees. Papa Dave arrs., gives history lessons, defines folk to include ""When You're Smiling,"" ""Taxman,"" and ""Wonderful Tonight,"" and sings like a busker who's found his place in the world.

Like so many of the best-liked new jazz albums, this one pays heartfelt respects to the carnivalesque--if you really wanted to, you could dance to it. But you'd probably rather listen, because at the same time it's highly composed, often dividing tunes into several distinct sections, and superbly played--John Purcell and Howard Johnson damn near keep up with master saxophonist David Murray. And beneath it all, tipping the balance between rowdy and civilized, is a Manfred Eicher mix that makes the record sit more like chamber music than DeJohnette could possibly have intended.

The all-their-records-sound-the-same putdowns can only mean no one is really listening. D&amp;B's singing has always been subtler than its framework, and their framework has never been more understated than here, though a couple of mediocre songs and too many sustained-climax gimmicks do put a crimp in. Delaney sounds best when reminding us that he owes more to John Hurt than to Otis Redding, while Bonnie peaks with new humor (""Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean"") and passion (""The Love of My Man"").

Delaney &amp; Bonnie are what would happen to rock and roll if it were capable of growing up--maybe they're what would happen to this country if it were capable of growing up. Whites so down-home their soul inflections sound inbred, they sing of love like teens of yore, but even though their love is quite physical it's been weathered spiritually and morally. No wonder Eric Clapton found their youthful fun and mature equanimity an antidote to the formless pretensions of Cream and Blind Faith. He certainly contributes--whenever the voices don't quite carry the one-take live performances, there he is with a terse, punchy solo that adds just the right note of strength and understanding. Nice that he's got Dave Mason (and Delaney himself) to help out. And nice that they all pay their respects to Robert Johnson and Little Richard.

An inevitable development in the class history of rap, they're new wave to Public Enemy's punk, and also ""pop"" rather than pop, as self-consciously cute and intricate as Shoes or Let's Active. Their music is maddeningly disjunct, and a few of the 24-cuts-in-67-minutes (too long for vinyl) are self-indulgent, arch. But their music is also radically unlike any rap you or anybody else has ever heard--inspirations include the Jarmels and a learn-it-yourself French record. And for all their kiddie consciousness, junk-culture arcana, and suburban in-jokes, they're in the new tradition--you can dance to them, which counts for plenty when disjunction is your problem.

Once pranksters whose greatest pleasure was disrupting the groove they adored, they've evolved into hip-hop's purest musicians. Partly our ears have changed and partly theirs have, so that their brilliant hunches now sound like glowing accomplishments. As they leapfrog around from Busta to Beastie, from herky-jerk drum and bass to diva anthem, from playground old-school to love-men ballad, this holds steady as the Temptations album of dreams, with Smokey and Holland-Dozier-Holland playing king-of-the-mountain and James Jamerson and Benny Benjamin doing God's work below. The lyrics are intelligent of course, clever and moral and street-conscious and just gnomic enough, but their art is in their beats and flow and tunes too. Hip-hop as a great black music, as amenable as jazz itself to young turks turned old masters.

FALSE,A-,The Imperial,The Delines,2019,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17440,"
As is clearer in the novels he's said are more ""easygoing"" than his music--particularly Lean On Pete, the movie version of which earned raves last year--Willy Vlautin's songs aren't dark because he thinks dark is cool or mistakes his own depressive tendencies for existential truth. Instead, the forlorn, mumbly affect of his signature band, Richmond Fontaine, is attributable more to his vocal limitations than to his philosophy of life. That's why he recruited Amy Boone to front the Delines. In both bands Vlautin finds pathos and dignity in sub-working class stragglers who drink too much and fall out of love when the money's gone. But Boone sings so thoughtful and caring that you feel the strength as well as the pain of the wronged women whose stories Vlautin has her tell--the escapee from Felony Flats and the lover fixing to buy her guy a new coat from Arlene's as well as Holly the Hustle stuck with a handicapper twice her age and Polly giving it one more try a day after Eddie busted her in the face. Deepest of all is the lead ""Cheer Up Charley,"" which doesn't mean Charley should go get stoned. It means that if he uses up all his vacation days he'll lose that ""job on the docks"" he'll never beat, and then what? ""There ain't no end to going down / There ain't no end / So cheer up Charley.""

Unless you see a band week after week, you have to wait till the album to gauge the depth of their songwriting, and these nice guys do all right by the sounding. The melodies are pretty basic, but that was to be expected; what's important is that they stick. The lyrics go for Blasters-style populism and achieve it with fewer downhome details and more international perspective. And if there's less singing and playing here than four or five gigs made me hope, that just makes me hope that next time they'll go commercial enough to hire a real producer instead of nice-guy Lou Whitney.

If 15 years later the anthem that goes ""I believe that there's a heaven before I'm dead"" seems almost as naive as the anti-imperialist title song, well, these guys were more a straw to be grasped than a future to be seized even at the time--an American version of the Clash just as the Clash was headed for the shredder, substituting for rootsy punk formalism a full embrace of rock and roll and its sources. Leader Scott Kempner and believer Eric Ambel were never dead-on songwriters or overwhelming singers, so this distillation is the perfect place to recall just how humanistic the straight stuff can be. Slightly out of time in their time, today they're just as likely to make you ask why the hell it couldn't happen again.

Presumably anybody who thinks her shtick has stagnated is too embarrassed to pay attention, because without doubt it's evolved. Subtly, OK, but the slowing tempos at least are hard to miss, and they go with the subtle part: the changing ways she's portrayed both herself and the objects of her affection over the past four years. Initially she enacted rockish boy-toy masochism--a pretty girl who got wet for an entire casting call of rough trade sugar daddies. But the third album of her tuneful, bonus-studded catalogue stars the torchy femme fatale who always lurked underneath, and by now half the objects of her exploitation are pretty clearly jerks. Born-to-lie Mr. Born to Lose is a game to her--she never bought into his bullshit. ""Salvatore,"" who could be based on her real-life Italian boyfriend for all I know, is auto-crooned so close to the edge of parody I wish she'd figured out how to sneak in the moon hitting her eye like a big pizza pie. But the biggest breakthrough is Lana herself on ""God Knows I Tried,"" where the artist born Lizzy Grant cops to her real-life fame and interrupts the come-ons to swear, ""I feel free when I see no one."" You never know--this dame might write a love song we can believe in someday. ""Freak"" and ""Blackest Day"" come fairly close.

From its opening chords, DeMent's own piano rolling beneath nearly every track--vernacular church piano, piano you can imagine a church lady playing--is the conceptual backbone of her first album of originals in 16 years. After ""livin' on the inside too much,"" books ""stacked on my table,"" she's ambitious intellectually like it or not, and the album has a James Agee quality right down to the unflattering cover photo of the 51-year-old artist. DeMent craves stuff she can ""see and touch,"" but her songwriting makes do just fine with feeling. However thickly she applies her drawl, she left the South at four, and figures out how to correct for that absence by force of artistic will. The laxest concepts drift toward the commonplace, but that's what the piano is celebrating, so you forgive her. The strongest concepts bear down on her parents and their faith, which she loves on their behalf and rejects on her own. ""The Night I Learned How Not to Pray"" has no piano at all.

In a way, the absence of Duane Allman from this set is a blessing. Instead of striving fruitlessly to match the high-tension interweave of the studio versions, D&amp;D function as the Eric Clapton Band, rolling easy the way they learned to with Delaney &amp; Bonnie. Clapton's vocals are rough and winning, and he gets to deliver his warm, clear, rapid runs of notes and slurs, well, how to say it--in concert rather than in competition (with Duane, with Jack and Ginger, with himself). Even ""Bottle of Red Wine"" and ""Blues Power"" make sense on-stage. Warning: the drum solo is on side two.

These fishermen don't kid around about what powers hardcore hyperdrive--not simply an unjust society, but also a battered psyche. When they're feeling bad, any kind of power--money, age, ass-man cool, the possession of a vagina--can set off their anarchic, patricidal, ""homo""-baiting, gynephobic rage. But their bad feelings add poignant weight to the doomed vulnerability of the last four songs, which happen to be their hookiest--""Marriage"" (""I want you to marry me""), ""Hope"" (""I'm not giving up""), ""Bikeage"" (""Don't be afraid, it's not too late"") and--chillingly--""Jean Is Dead.""

Dessa is so good at psychology--so clear and penetrating, so sharp-tongued and tender-hearted--she might have turned off the psych-spewing freak-folkers and nostalgic romantics of the former coffee-house circuit anyway. Love, friendship, anxiety, ambition--she addresses these things as if Nashville wasn't the last bastion of realism in the musical universe.

There's lots of cheesy keyb in the mix; full-repeat call-and-response and mullah harangues stir up the hectic mood. It's on top of all this that you get the guitar, which sings and declaims and shouts out loud instead of just chiming or chattering. I find the hottest soukous relaxing. I put this on to wake up.

Though it's fronted by soft-sung Aurlus Mabele, Kanda Bongo's man Diblo Dibala dominates--rolling out sweetly, sheerly, endlessly, piling signature riff on signature riff, his guitar lines and interludes lift and lyricize the boss's stripped-down Afrodisco.

As with so many electrohop beats, Die Antwoord's are short on texture and rhythmic subtlety--it's clear this DJ Hi-Tek isn't the African-American one well before his backstory leaks out. So I might have figured their album for a worthy curiosity if I hadn't seen their show, found the video that began it with a big bang, and located their lyrics online. Yet as mere listening the best songs here--especially ""Fish Paste"" and the signature ""Enter the Ninja""--convey the disturbing comic character Watkin Tudor ""Waddy"" Jones has created: Ninja, an Afrikaner ex-con who's remade himself in the misconstrued image of an American rapper. Ninja's not a gangsta--he does drugs but lacks the organizational skill to deal them, and though he'll knock your lights out if you touch him and is given to sadistic sex fantasies, he doesn't mention guns once. But freed to express his ""inner coloured,"" he bellows and sweats prideful ressentiment--he just knows everyone's jealous because he's ""on the interweb."" His child-voiced consort Yo-landi Vi$$er backs him up so obscenely that it takes a while to realize that she's both the secret of the music and the rich-bitch top dog in a bottom-feeding power couple. Guttural, English-infected Afrikaans is the perfect language for this brutal fantasy. But the tell comes when Ninja breaks into Zulu in a song celebrating the size of his penis, and Yo-landi handcuffs him to the bed so she can steal his money.

Although her girlcult loves her madly, the guys I know smell trouble every time she opens her mouth. This has nothing to do with her face, body, or sense of style. It's her words, the sheer volume of them, jetting out in expressionistic torrents as if she feels free to say any goddamn thing that comes to mind. But give DiFranco the chance and she may just make you like her ancient formula for self-indulgent songpoetry. Augmented only by a drummer this time, her acoustic guitar and electric bass produce a one-of-a-kind sound, and those torrents take shape as literal accounts of a mercurial inner life with more love than anger in it. So if she's not my type and maybe not yours, big deal. At 24, she already has seven albums hanging from her nose ring, and they're getting good enough that we need her more than she needs us.

I mean, she knows--knows what a pain in the ass she is, knows how much space her emotions take up, knows she once banged a power line with her stickball bat and blacked out the entire eastern seaboard. She boasts about her integrity, her vulnerability, her joy. She jokes about them too. She has a friend's mom phone in obscure verses of ""Amazing Grace."" She utters, I kid you not, the most vituperative ""fuck you"" in the history of the music. She is herself, and for once that's more than enough.

DiFranco has always been beat-happy. From the beginning you can catch her speed-strumming just for the rush, but in general her guitar figures and her sense of rhythm are both much quirkier; older folkies would have diagnosed them as symptoms of some awful nervous disorder. In the spare and agile Andy Stochansky, who isn't averse to powering up but more characteristically states and embellishes a single eccentric line with brushes or mallets or lightly wielded sticks, she may have found the best folk-rock drummer who's ever lived, and this live double-CD, which draws liberally on her formative folk-punk years for those who only caught on with Dilate, is his showcase. Joined as well by the supplest of her several bassists, Gang of Four stalwart Sara Lee, DiFranco proves herself not just miraculously arch and sisterly and sexy and effervescent, but a bandleader who has wiggled free of deadening acoustic-with-backup commonplaces--and evolved from the truth of ""Smile pretty and watch your back"" to that of ""We lose sight of everything when we have to keep checking our backs.""

But DiFranco doesn't have much use for ordinary standards of cool, which is one reason she's new-famous, and for the nonce, she can do no wrong. Always underlying her bull-session eloquence, a hook no matter the message, is the supple, seductive, self-amused musicality that puts her records across. A typical touch here is her choice of world-jazz-ambient trumpeter Jon Hassell to decorate the 14-minute spoken-word finale ""Pulse"": ""you crawled into my bed/like some sort of giant insect/and I found myself spellbound/at the sight of you there/beautiful and grotesque/and all the rest of that bug stuff.""

After a decade of futzing around, of music so overthought that even her best-of couldn't make a case for it, this one's like re-encountering a friend who drifted away after she took a bad job or married a jerk. Both of which might have happened--nobody she signed to Righteous Babe did much for her bottom line, and the nuptials that ruffled her feminist faithful in 1998 ended badly in 2003. Now, finally, her first album since she married her five-year-old's father is as fresh as Lisa Lee at the top of the key. With Uncle Pete signing on via banjogram, the title song announces a political renewal so focused on the three-syllable F-word that it includes an E.R.A. anthem. But for DiFranco the political has always been personal, which doesn't mean private and can mean intellectualized, as""Promiscuity."" The singing on the homelessness tale that opens is as emotionally accomplished as its assumed first-person is formally atypical. The one that reads ""If yr not getting happier as you get older/then yr fucking up"" is her true credo.

The hectic dissonances underneath the original ""Sex Packets"" jar the senses nicely, but I'll take the slick byplay of this laid-back in-your-face, which sets out to prove that funky dooesn't mean hard.

In 2010, I was lucky enough to hear music like this at 3 a.m. in a rundown Koranic school cum social club north of Dakar--a woman named Khady Mboup bellowing and expostulating over two xalams, four sabar/tama drums, a plastic washtub, and a female sidekick as three or four dozen paying customers came back at her with impossibly athletic dancing. It was so unrelenting I figured it couldn't translate to record. Yet the YouTube I've found on Mboup is supper-club stuff compared to this 1994 barrage from a long-gone heroine of a female griot rap poetry called taasu. Four drummers and a drum programmer provide the instrumentation, three subsidiary female vocalists respond in unison to her call, and for half an hour the onslaught never lets up. Diop's voice is pitched high for something so powerful, intense, and conversational. It gets hard to take without dance accompaniment after three tracks or so, and although to non-Wolof speakers it's of a piece, the opening ""Dieuleul-Dieuleul"" tends to dwarf and subsume the five equally tuneless songs/poems/tracks that recapitulate. But it's also almost otherworldly, with an energy that reminds me of great hardcore, Minor Threat or Bad Brains. Stop, please stop. No, keep going.

Hardcore's gotten confusing for oldsters; in these post-Fugazi days, a lot of it sounds like jazz. But it sure beats the folk-rock that used to sound like jazz. Here's a D.C. unit that convened in 1993 and made this third album on Interscope's dime during the merger mess. The only way they're punk anymore is that there aren't very many of them and that none of them seems to be playing a keyboard even though most of them can. What they are instead is a much rarer thing, no matter what Ron Sexsmith and Richard Buckner pretend--thoughtful, quirky, mercurial young adults skilled at transforming doubt into music. Tracking his feelings through irregular structures and jumpy rhythms, Travis Morrison is always lyrical, even celebratory--full of regrets like many honest men, never ever a sad sack.

Appreciated by old fans and dismissed by ""critics,"" a word still loosely applied to anybody permitted to post music reviews on a website someone else runs, this reunion album means so much more than the average so-called comeback not just because Travis Morrison is smarter than most ""critics"" and possibly you and conceivably me, but on this evidence better balanced. He's happily married with a kid. He's not vaguely a punk anymore. His musical side will never consume him again. But he's still both a punchy lyricist and a guy who'll grab a good hook wherever one pokes out its business end. The centerpiece follows the grateful marriage song ""Lookin'"" with the cautionary parenthood song ""Daddy Was a Real Good Dancer,"" a tribute that's also a pledge not to follow in Daddy's footsteps--first ""He had me and then he threw his dancin' shoes away,"" then, if only Daddy was still around, ""I'd hand him my baby girl/And play some rock and roll.""

As critics kvell, skeptics eye their p.c. quotient: a black rapper with white adoptive parents and Asian American DJ who subsumes his racial analysis in an explicitly antihomophobic, antixenophobic leftism and allies himself with the Piss Christ and the Dead Kennedys. And for sure a few of the ideas are pat or simplistic and a few of the metaphors flat or anticlimactic (""politics is merely the decoy of perception""? wha?). But if Michael Franti is no Linton Kwesi Johnson, neither was LKJ at 25. His wordslinging isn't quite Chuck D., subject of the ballsy imitation/tribute/parody/critique ""Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury,"" but his intellectual grasp thrusts him immediately into pop's front rank--I'd put money on his thought quicker than Michael Stipe's or Michelle Shocked's, not to mention Richard Thompson's or Black Francis's. And then there's the DJ that isn't--with crucial help from Consolidated's Mark Pistel, industrial percussionist Rono Tse is a one-man hip hop band. He creates more music than he samples, stretching Bomb Squad parameters to carry the tracks whenever Franti falters. I'd like to think the two could penetrate right to hip hop's fragmented core. But if they never achieve full cultural resonance, their art will have to suffice. And it will.

The unsinging hero of this solo debut is a song doctor I'd never heard of named Jennifer Dicelvio, whose big credit is too big--the bombastic Andra Day Grammy nominee ""Rise Up."" Always drawn to Ditto's punky fat-lesbian image, I never thought her band was much or her songwriting either. So I make it a good thing that at 36 she's gone both solo and pop, and with Dicelvio's help delivered what pop albums are supposed to deliver, only with guitars rather than keyboards--well-defined tunes with relatable lyrics that get where they're going without distracting shows of the pipes I'm grateful she doesn't have. People think her voice is huge, but that's really her energy, or maybe just how bold she is about her body. Here her most salient vocal quality is a clarity that never thins out her commitment or understates her joy and pain. The pain, I read, reflects a bad patch in her marriage. May she outlast it to enjoy the perfect confluence of ""We Could Run"" and ""Love in Real Life.""

Before we proceed to the principals, give it up to garage-punk drummer Sam Brown, who does more than Handsome Furs/Wolf Parade yeoman Dan Boeckner to blast Spoon's Britt Daniel out of his self-contained art-funk bubble. Although the songwriting is split evenly, most of the lead vocals go to Boeckner, one of many recent singers to make straight-leaning rock seem duller (Handsome Furs) or sillier (Wolf Parade) than need be. Not good, you might think. Only soon you realize how much Daniel's spiky synths, still the strongest presence musically, benefit from Boeckner's adherance to emotional convention (and Brown's drumming). Never has Spoon conveyed so much heft or breathing room. In short, this rocks differently in a year when it's been hard to use that verb without reflecting on the mortality of all things.

But it's his band experience that powers his good little Southern pop record. Not only does he write hooky songs with a twist--my two favorites involve a bisexual and a one-night stand, half a dozen stand out, and most of the rest plus two covers are fun at least--but he sings them with the kind of ersatz soul that floors houses and counterbalances his Farfisa riffs with compressed guitar spectacles.

The first thing to understand about Dizzee is that his fundamental appeal is musical, and the second is that there's very little music there. Break down a track and often you'll find only an electro beat--at most three or four sparse elements, rarely long on sustain or tune. Yet as someone who mocked the minimal means of U.K. garage and considered the Streets barely music at all, I was captivated by Dizzee's sound the moment I heard the import. His adolescent gulps and yowls are street-Brit with a Jamaican liquidity, as lean, eccentric, and arresting as the beats. The voice also lends a comic, claustrophobic vulnerability to rhymes whose brilliance varies, though their winning youthfulness does not. Whether he can grow as a lyricist as he struggles to comprehend his success is the old conundrum. The smarts he's got. The right advice will be hard to come by.

Only then the record flipped on me. There's plenty in the world to be bummed about, and if the cultural fate of the Middle East isn't as high on that long list as it was a year ago, Rupture is here to remind us that it's still around to bite us in the collective ass. No fan of his art-dance scene, I don't recognize a single source record of the 24 he flows in here. But in this sequence they speak to me of resilience, intelligence, openness and loss. Most aren't explicitly Islamic, but Middle Eastern sounds and rhythms contextualize the toasting, the dub, the electronica effects. Elegiac rather than dancey, but elegiac about the preconditions of the dance, it states, sustains, and varies a bracing mood. It even has an ending.

Lester Bangs calls it horrible noise, I call it skronk and say it's funny as hell and just as gut-wrenching--chaos neither celebrated nor succumbed to, just shaped into, well, postchaos.

Arto Lindsay, Ikue Mori, Robin Crutchfield, and/or Tim Wright recorded 12 songs lasting 23 minutes in four years of boho mayhem, and these songs justify a CD. As Byron Coley and Glenn O'Brien outdo themselves explaining, this was art-noise like no other, more anarchic yet more structured than anything else called no wave: dense little aural paint-bombs im/exploding painfully and sportively all over the world-music avant-garde (whatever that means, which with them was everything). But 23 minutes don't a major reissue make, and so Jason Gross has unearthed 20 more tracks in 40 more minutes. Some of those that feature Lindsay's strangled vocals, especially from the ""Fiorucci tape"" but also the live ""Nearing"" and ""Brand New,"" are up to the standard of the official oeuvre. Others reduce to avant-vamps with bassist Wright in the lead, especially the program music--""Police Chase"" is quite onomatopoeic--that accompanied a Squat Theatre play. As Wright replaced Crutchfield, Lindsay's groovier tendencies began to surface, the way God intended. But closet prog Crutchfield kept the focus on form. You'll know what that form is when you hear it. If you find you don't, listen again.

Acclimated after three and a half years, I find the music easy to love even though it's more exotic than ever--immersed in the Latin accents of '50s (and '50s) dance music, blissfully indifferent to current disco formulas. And for all the charm of Cory Daye's solo bid with Sandy Linzer, her wit and grace--that is, her chance to be remembered as the finest female vocalist to emerge in the '70s--is showcased more precisely by August Darnell's words and Stoney Browder's music. I only wish I knew what the lyrics meant sometimes (especially that one about the neo-nazi). A little clarity, rather than the indulgently atmospheric Hollywood romanticism Darnell strives for, might make up for the absence of floor hits.

But though the beats remain electro, the slasher-movie shtick moves his buddies the Diesel Truckers to find out how low his production can go, including a hook that has Peter Lorre wheedling ""I'm very hungry"" again just when you thought it was safe to get back in the elevator. No rapper has ever imagined such disgusting apartments--lurid locales with fluorescent cereal on the floor.

Seems dead in the water, a foregone conclusion waiting to happen. A cleaned-up Dr. consorts with Warner jazz guys and a numerically big band to erect ""a tribute to the music of my hometown""--not his first, and hardly his last. Yet it seldom stumbles, not even when a femme quartet led by the distaff half of Shirley &amp; Lee warbles the chorus of ""Good Night Irene""--which, the Dr.'s expansive notes notwithstanding, wasn't written by Leadbelly at Angola Penitentiary or anywhere else (he adapted it much earlier from an 1880s minstrel tune by a biracial NYC duo, and that's what I love about the South). Rarely has the Dr. sung with more gusto, especially on the four comic songs about murder, infidelity, or both, and his cockamamy notion of hitching a gris-gris chant to a Louis Moreau Gottschalk composition sets a properly improbable mood. ""Fess Up"" is one of his trickiest Roy Byrd rips ever. Two Jelly Roll Mortons is about right. Even ""Since I Fell for You"" kind of fits.

The merits don't matter much because his interactions with his no-name band are so loose and swinging, and his vocals so projected, never a given in this fetishizer of the New Orleans drawl.

Moodwise it recalls upful French-Basque internationalist Manu Chao. But it's less yielding, with a groove that stomps. Although my tiny store of Spanish didn't suss out any language more specific than ""Babylon,"" the translations on his website pit doctors against dictators, equate bureaucrats with politicians with cops, and call Bolivian comrades ""B-boys.""

Granted, ""Wife Sitter"" is as nasty as Jody songs get, mostly because Dogg plays the cuckold-making Jody with such relish. And to call your sweetest love song ""I Couldn't Pay for What I Got Last Night"" is to combine the two themes more intimately than most soul men consider necessary.

But oldish doesn't mean dated. These days, the man claims he composes twenty or thirty songs a day while driving his cab, and you can bet they're very much like these--more political, not as prime. You know he's still detailing the marriage wars with embarrassing pungency, still hearing a Stax-Volt-cum-Malaco four-four with blues obbligatos, still dreaming of the glory he deserves.

Just as a for instance, where the hell is ""I've Never Been to Africa (And It's Your Fault),"" which sums up his worldview if anything does? So I guess the point is that nothing does--he's not only sui generis but completely contradictory, like most people, few of whom would think of writing 400 songs about it. By now his daring soul-rock hybrid is a studio convention, his big piercing voice arguably monochromatic. But between his wild takes on the ins and outs of the monogamy he lives for and his classic and cockamamy mix of political radicalism and cultural conservatism, this Afrocentric integrationist has written more interesting songs cruising in his cab than most tunesmiths manage in their luxury suites.

What connects these 13 tracks to Hurricane Katrina is that without the disaster they might not have been released until the man died. All were recorded by 2000, and only two, neither the stone standout you'd assume, didn't originate with Domino, who says it took years to write some of them right. You'd never guess it. The descending four-note piano hook on ""One Step at a Time,"" for instance, could be played by a three-year-old--with a perfect sense of rhythm. But just ask Ernest Hemingway when you get the chance: Artistic simplicity can be that way. Compared to the uncredited studio work here, Richard Perry's tastefully star-studded Fats revivals of the late '60s sound like, somewhere between Phil Spector and Phil Ramone.

It didn't help that the former Daniel Dumile changed his handle from MF Doom, or that where MF stood for various things, the obvious never explicitly one of them, JJ merely honors his new beatmaking partner Jneiro Jarel. Nor did it help that he was compelled by the INS to resettle in London, apparently because he never became a U.S. citizen. So on his 2012 album this hyperaware jokester plays the Brit. One track goes on about ""Cockney rhymin' slang,"" and then there's ""Guv'nor,"" hardly the only song where the political mindfulness that's always been there becomes a focus rather than a substratum.

It's really only Ziggy Modeliste's drumming that keeps side two going.

Every cut on this astonishingly listenable album is a minor pleasure; I'm delighted by even its silliest (""God Must Have Blessed America"") and simpiest (""Can I Be the One"") moments.

Once these black Canadians put out a well-liked album that missed the tail end of Daisy Age. Then they vanished. Gang Starr and Digable Planets connections got their next CD a token U.S. release, but the one after was strictly commonwealth--as far as the south-of-the-border rap community was concerned, King Lu and Capital Q no longer existed. So maybe nobody told them that you claim street no matter how middle-class you are, that jazz samples were a doomed fad, that Digable Planets blinked out faster than the evening star. And maybe that was good. Probably it didn't feel like that to them; one of their best songs is called ""I've Lost My Ignorance,"" and I'm sure the disillusion hurt. But though their inspiration wanes slightly, they never surrender their thoughtful intricacy or race-man lyricism. Certainly they belong in the same sentence as De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest.

Beyond the tribute to a glamorous aunt who knew how to show a five-year-old a good time, Patterson Hood's are most impressive when he channels two lost good old boys we might not like so much in person: well, a vet afraid to own that automatic weapon OK, but how about that cop thrown off the force? Mike Cooley owns the best tunes and the best lines: ""like bringing flowers to your Mama and tracking dog shit all over the floor."" Shonna Tucker shows Eddie Hinton a good time in the grave.

FALSE,A-,Don't Mind Rockin' Tonite,Ducks Deluxe,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6753,"
Comprising six (of the seven best) tracks from the deleted Ducks Deluxe, three from the import-only Taxi to the Terminal Zone, and some singles, this candidly simplistic compilation is designed to appeal to fans of the Rumour (featuring ex-Duck Martin Belmont) and the Motors (headed by ex-Deluxe Nick Garvey and Andy McMasters). Neither of whom have all that many fans, actually. The music is pure rock and roll, maybe too pure, combining the Rumour's spirited intensity and the Motors' cheerful manipulation at a more primitive stage. Fans of the Tyla Gang will dig it.

These smart young depressives not only work their variation on the garage-guitar Amerindie vernacular, they make it signify: the sludgy stasis of the rhythms and offhand density of the textures reinforce ruminative, overheard lyrical commonplaces. Their commitment and concentration are the best argument for pop formalism since the Shoes, and if one key difference is that they never try to be tuneful, another is that they never try to be cute. Instead, they get so into being down they convince you it's interesting.

FALSE,A-,Forever and Ever,Champion Jack Dupree,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=563,"
On the label debut of this long-exiled songster-pianist, the Rounder folks worked session men, thematic material, and MLK rumination into a standard Crescent City hustle, sending the roots claque into paroxysms of approbation. Here the quality control board lets up some, with results that seem far more personal and overheard--a dirty old man in fine fettle entertaining the room. And for sure his age is part of the charm. When an 82-year-old can sing the blues about how his family gave him away when he was one, you know his shtick has staying power.

An expatriate at 50, the overrecorded last of the barrelhouse pianists laid down some of his best music in sweet home New Orleans before he went back to Hamburg to die at 82: hyped supersession, cockeyed follow-up, posthumous farewell. I've always preferred the follow-up, in part because it begins with the adoptee's lament ""They Gave Me Away,"" in part because it seems so uncalculated and associative--an entertainer made not born letting down what hair he's got left because he's too old to play it safe anymore. All the wildest stuff from that one is here, together with the tightest stuff from the debut and the most responsive stuff from the farewell. Songster blues. Decrepitude feeling its oats.

Dury is a pub rock survivor, as tough and homely as a dandelion, as English as music halls, billingsgate, and Gene Vincent. The tenacious wit and accuracy of his lyrics betray how uncommon he believes his blockheaded protagonists really are, and his music rocks out in the traditional blues-based grooves without kissing the past's ass. Tender, furious, sexy, eccentric, surprising.

In case you were wondering how definitive that self-portrait was, here comes its mirror image four months later. Call it love on the rebound. This time he's writing the pop (and folk) genre experiments himself, and thus saying more about true romance than is the pop (or folk) norm. Two side-closing throw-ins--a sillyditty about a gal named ""Winterlude"" and the scatting beatnik send-up ""If Dogs Run Free""--almost steal the show. And the two other side-closers, which make religion seem dumber than it already is, damn near give it back.

FALSE,A-,Planet Waves,Bob Dylan,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=371,"
In a time when all the most prestigious music, even what passes for funk, is coated with silicone grease, Dylan is telling us to take that grease and jam it. Sure he's domestic, but his version of conjugal love is anything but smug, and this comes through in both the lyrics and the sound of the record itself. Blissful, sometimes, but sometimes it sounds like stray cat music--scrawny, cocky, and yowling up the stairs.

FALSE,A-,Under the Red Sky,Bob Dylan,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=375,"
This Was Bros. pseudothrowaway improves on the hushed emotion, weary wisdom, and new-age ""maturity"" of the Daniel Lanois-produced Oh Mercy even if the lyrics are sloppier--the anomaly is what Lanois calls Oh Mercy's ""focused"" writing. Aiming frankly for the evocative, the fabulistic, the biblical, Dylan exploits narrative metaphor as an adaptive mechanism that allows him to inhabit a ""mature"" pessimism he knows isn't the meaning of life. Where his seminal folk-rock records were cut with Nashville cats on drums--Kenny Buttrey when he was lucky, nonentities when he wasn't--here Kenny Aronoff's tempos are postpunk like it oughta be, springs and shuffles grooving ever forward. The fables are strengthened by the workout, and as a realist I also treasure their literal moments. I credit his outrage without forgetting his royalty statements. I believe he's gritted his teeth through the bad patches of a long-term sexual relationship even if he still measures the long term in months. And when he thanks his honey for that cup of tea, I melt.

Dylan's second attempt to revive the folk music revival while laying down a new record without writing any new songs is eerie and enticing. He cherishes the non sequiturs, sudden changes of heart, and received or obscure blank spots in these buried songs--all usages he's long since absorbed into his own writing because he believes they evoke a world that defies rationalization. Me, I'm not so sure it doesn't just seem that way because there's no way we can be intimate with their worlds anymore. And while only a crank could resist his liner notes, that doesn't mean it isn't cranky in the extreme to hold, for instance, that the two-timing aristo who gets his in ""Love Henry"" is ""modern corporate man off some foreign boat, unable to handle his `psychosis' responsible for organizing the Intelligentsia,"" und so weiter. We do not live in ""the New Dark Ages."" And if we did, Dylan would call out for rationalization right quick.

A soundscape as surely as Maxinquaye or The Ballad of Tom Joad, only more tuneful and less depressive--that is, merely bereft, rather than devoid of will or affect. Lyrically, it splits the difference between generalized El Lay schlock and minor Child ballad; a typical couplet goes, ""You left me standing in the doorway crying/In the dark land of the sun."" So the words are good enough except on the Billy Joel-covered ""Make You Feel My Love,"" yet rarely what you come back for. The hooks are Dylan's spectral vocals--just his latest ventriloquist's trick, a new take on ancient, yet so real, so ordained--and a band whose quietude evokes the sleepy postjunk funk of Clapton's 461 Ocean Boulevard without the nearness of sex. Special kudos to Augie Meyers, the Al Kooper we've been waiting for.

So this rap nerd who rhymes this band he likes called the Kinks with a refrigerator that don't stink makes up songs for these Chicagoans. In one he's a superhero he thought up himself who protects his neck with magic jewels; in another he celebrates a holiday he thought up himself by extinguishing garbage fires; in yet another he's so brave he had an asthma attack last bar and you didn't even notice.

In the studio, musicianship renders this Canadian singer-songwriter one more rough-hewn troubadour with his heart pinned firmly to his hollow-body. On this live double, his need to shout over bar talk and penetrate the sloppy strum-and-thrum of his drumless good-enough-for-folk-rock band combines happily with the best-of effect, resulting in a raucous celebration of male chauvinism Montgomery Gentry should only envy--for its powers of observation, class solidarity, and laugh lines. The fast hard ones are all great, and they outnumber the medium-tempo corny ones, which bottom out at tolerable and memorably honor migrant workers and a good dog. Not counting the song that goes, ""When exactly did we become white trash,"" my three favorite fast ones are all about souped-up gas guzzlers, the finest of which drives up to an old-age home. Never again do I expect to enjoy an album that begins and ends with songs about trains. Then again, I never expected to enjoy this one.

When the vernacular flows easy or sounds that way, a rare thing, five wives and enough heroin to destroy a saner man are the kind of myth rock and roll fools are always mistaking for reality. And clean though Earle may be, he's not above or beyond embracing that myth--among his latest celebrations of romantic dysfunction is one where he all but dares the object of his obsession to call the cops. Better the laconic narratives and pipeline to the great American tune clusters of this alternative offering, a trad reimmersion with Norman Blake and Peter Rowan picking mandolins and dobros as Earle dredges up songs by his fine young self. ""Tom Ames' Prayer"" and ""Hometown Blues,"" from '76 and '77, are as undeniable as any Earle this side of ""The Devil's Right Hand."" And so are ""Angel Is the Devil"" and ""Ben McCulloch,"" from '92 and '95.

Earle writes with the flair and searching eye of a great talker who's also a great reader, and he can sing with anyone--on The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, his dissol""In the Jailhouse Now"" keeps the ball rolling after two of the canniest vocals of Bob Dylan's and Willie Nelson's not exactly thoughtless careers. But now that he's sober he sounds drunker than ever, recalling the blurry, lost-my-dentures drawl of John Prine at his cutest. And since unlike Prine he doesn't take naturally to cute, his back-porch sentimentality can seem as unearned as any folk revivalist's; when he reflects too much, as is his current spiritual wont, he proves that the only thing softer than a tough guy's heart of gold is a populist radical's corazon sangriento. While hoping the born-to-lose sex problems of his rock comeback are behind him, I still find his fast ones more convincing than his slow ones.

He's tried the outlaw thing, and on his best album in 15 years sets out to tell the world why it ain't all that. Your buddies on those roughneck temp gigs always head elsewhere. When the news from home is bad, and it will be, there's not a damn thing you can do about it. Hitchhiking is so over a fella could write a keeper about it. And to sum up: ""Everybody reckons that they want to be free / Nobody wants to be alone."" A guy who's been married seven times is more likely to know nothing about women than everything. But from ""Comes to love fallin' is the easy part"" to ""You can't pretend / The line between a secret and a lie ain't razor thin,"" he gets a keeper out of that too. While I surely do agree that in love a secret and a lie are the same thing, I hope it will interest him to be told that the secret of not being alone is to let yourself keep falling--for the same one.

With bluegrass ""more comfortable all the time,"" the sometime country-rocker turns in his strongest and loosest record of the decade. But bluegrass it ain't--it's too comfortable. I was so impressed with how the music moaned and shivered and flapped around in the wind I wondered how I'd ever overlooked McCoury's outfit until I played their new CD, which is just as clean and tight and anal as every other spoor of Bill Monroe I've ever swept out the door. Slurring like a moonshiner who's been on a mush diet since his bird dog died, Earle rowdies up McCoury's sharpsters till they turn all hairy and bounce off walls like the Pogues. And though the songs are less literary, more generic--blues and breakdown, ""pinko folk song"" and ""real-live-bad-tooth hillbilly murder ballad""--literature is Earle's critical selling point. His stories always sing.

On side one the vocal systole-diastole finally comes together, with Philip Bailey definitive, as he deserves to be; Maurice White, meanwhile, provides tuneful, relatively unselfconscious songs over a light Latin-funk beat jarred by grunts, horn riffs, and keyboard squiggles. A very pleasant surprise. Side two, where they always stretch out and often make fools of themselves, is a survey of EW&amp;F's roots, from the kalimba-hooked ""Drum Song"" through street rap through 1:41 of expert cocktail bebop (didn't know Maurice had that rim shot in him) through schlock scat to the devotional theme song, written in 1958 by one Leon Lumkins.

Since classic EW&amp;F succeeds in spite of Maurice White's universalist hoohah, the paucity of inspirational numbers is a blessing. The one that celebrates voting is gratifyingly practical, the one that celebrates children's eyes one too many, and otherwise we're free to gape at this band's spectacular popcraft. Their sonic affluence and showtime groove encompass whispering strings no less perfect than their JB guitar beats, Funkafunnies harmonies no less schmaltzy than their Lionel Richie homages, and when the synthesis is this catchy it's the best argument for universalism they'll ever make.

And you know what? At one nullity and one dubiety a side, it's every bit as solid as Vol. I, which happens to be the best album they ever released. I should mention that because I prefer their slick early-'80s decline to their soulful late-'70s ascendancy (not to mention their fusoid early-'70s launch), my tastes in this matter are unorthodox if not crackpot. But if you could scarcely give a shit, which at this late date is sane enough, here's some slick, soulful fun.

This sounds like a Rockpile album while Nick Lowe's doesn't because Lowe loves rock and roll for everything it implies as culture while Edmunds loves it for everything it is as music. There is a richness of reference here that leaves Edmunds's rockabilly phase far behind--five of the songs are imaginative genre pieces from two pubberies that appear to specialize in pub-rock revivalism, new ones by Parker and Costello add that contemporary touch, and the zesty remake of ""Home in My Hand"" cuts Brinsley Schwarz's. But what defines the music is Edmunds's willingness to defer to the overdrive of the two other guys in the band, unsung guitarist Billy Bremner and pitiless drummer Terry Williams. In unity there is power.

Ignoring his slower and more eccentric moments for the nonstop energy punks misprise from rockabilly, with bullheaded recent covers of ""The Race Is On"" and ""Singing the Blues"" decelerating into upper midtempo for respite, this compilation defines Edmunds as a trouble boy. Actually, if you'll listen to ""Trouble Boys"" for two minutes you'll learn that Edmunds is scared shitless of trouble boys--as were, I'll bet, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, the Everly Brothers, and Elvis himself.

Scandalously underrecorded, which I'm sure has nothing to do with the fact that he's black, Edwards remains firm in his allegiances. ""Hank and Lefty Raised My Country Soul,"" he announces, and though he sounds more like Lefty than Hank and more like Merle than either, he's got a right. The voice has Haggard's swing and melismatic burr, but it's more powerful, an advantage except when it gets too thick. And though Edwards literally can't read or write, he makes up good songs and picks better ones. Between ""We Sure Danced Us Some Good Ones,"" a believable account of a good marriage in a music that reserves its honesty for the bad ones, to ""Summer Melodies,"" about innocent fun, he touches all the bases without sententiousness or whoop-de-doo.

Doesn't really matter that headman Rick Rizzo's vocals are strong-that's-all and Bob Dylan is too much with them--""It's All a Game""'s fed-up get-it-together and ""Daedalus""'s dippy dream notwithstanding, these songs don't signify as songs, but as music. The band's alternative pigeonhole proves AOR guys are scared shitless of rocking out. And its anomalous clubland profile typifies an aesthetic fallacy that long preceded the naming of postmodernism.

Oldschoolfreshbeathiphopr&amp;b--run through Elliott's considerable talent and good heart or reasonable facsimile, these are meaningless categories. Elliott's disinclination to give it up to gangsta's thrill cult or black pop's soft-focus porn, plus her proven ability to work a good beat when she gets one, leads her naturally to a collection that ebbs and flows, peaks and dips, and pokes fun at any canon of taste you got.

Innovative though it is, the video obscures the musical originality of ""The Rain,"" its spacing and layering simultaneously sparer and busier than anything ordinarily allowed on the radio, and without Ann Peebles hooking you in, the rest of the album poses the same kind of congenial challenge. Sooner or later its pleasantness reveals itself as erotic--explicitly sexual enough to establish an atmosphere in which pleasure is something that happens simply and spontaneously between friendly free agents.

Ely hasn't yet learned how to disguise his rather thin timbre behind savvy phrasing, but as a result he projects an attractive openness--country singers (the men, anyway) rarely betray such innocent longing. Not that he's a country singer, exactly--this is real country-rock in a unique blend. And if Ely is only three-quarters of a singer (more like nine-tenths, actually), he's two writers--his silent partner Butch Hancock evokes the eternal cycle of good times and Tuesdays after, of connection and distance, with a delight in wordplay that complements Ely's more direct lyrical style.

Now that I've finally gotten the message, a year and a half after this great lost American band dispersed into the wilds of Wichita, I still can't repeat it back to you. Which may help explain how the band got lost. Even garage-rock isn't a broad enough genre description--the song shapes here are just too ungainly. Their lyrics are too wide-ranging and elusive for modern romance, yet too down-to-earth and just plain funny to get lumped in with the neotrippies. And while the voice of John Nichols, described by annotator Drew Wheeler as belonging to ""an All-American adolescent in a state of psycho-sexual confusion,"" provides a convenient way in, I know that what makes me sit up and say yeah is the kick of Bill Goffrier's rather grungy guitar. You figure it out.

Sticking nine-inch nails through his eyelids, flattening a black bully with a four-inch broom, reminding his conscience/producer about Dee Barnes, watching helplessly as an abused Valley Girl OD's on his shrooms, cajoling his baby daughter Hailey into helping him get rid of her mom's body, he shows more comic genius than any pop musician since--Loudon Wainwright III?

No connoisseur of commercially illicit music, I neglected to seek this out when it surfaced last summer and ended up taping a borrowed one, though I'm sure the Napster-literate could burn something similar. We've all heard some of this music, but having the guest shots compiled here on one longform cements what a nonstop force he is. ""Stan"" or no ""Stan,"" he's a rhymer not a storyteller, an inspired free-associater who like so many rappers loves rhyme as raw technical device and finds fresh sonic material in a self-renewing English language hooked on celebrities, brand names, neologisms, code--and a world where ""real"" poets long ago distanced themselves from rhyme the way ""real"" composers distanced themselves from tune. Unlike such African American coequals as Mos Def, or Aceyalone, say, he has no apparent metaphysical ambitions--he's a comedian and prankster whose own art mines the metaphysics of entertainment, a/k/a celebrity. He's totally ill here, more into sex, and smack up against Dr. Dre's or Missy Elliott's his flow rocks. Interscope: You got the juice. Market an improved version when Marshall Mathers falls off.

The comeback is for Eminem, not Slim Shady--and for Marshall at his most martial. His most confessional as well--he admits Relapse was ""ehh,"" admits he came this close to beefing with Wayne and Kanye, admits ""I'da had my ass handed to me."" No matter how cleverly he's rhyming, which varies, he could use subject matter beyond married-to-the-game and his traditional obsessions. But with Shady in the shadows, rarely are these themes lifted by Em's long-recessive sense of play. Bringing the proceedings over the top, however, are the three final tracks: Rihanna's ""Love the Way You Lie"" hook depositing some bodily fluids on Em's conjugal seesaw, ""You're Never Over"" nailing Marshall's love for Proof, and the bonus boast ""Untitled"" renewing our love for Shady. And delivering the best music qua music in 77 minutes is none other than Lil Wayne, whose 16 on ""No Love"" would be the funkiest thing here if Wayne didn't then hand Eminem his ass back by inserting acutely timed grunts and such for the rest of the track.

Lapsed science teacher Chad Matheny specialized in electro-noise until he figured out how chords and beats work, enabling him to put together a futuristic folk music in which nerdy melodies rise out of a shambolic clatter that's the best anyone can expect with the power going out all the time. The opening ""Erica Western Teleport"" and the closing ""Erica Western Geiger Counter"" celebrate his crush on a rebel hero who scopes corporatist disaster areas where dystopian sci-fi is indistinguishable from democratic-socialist realism. In ""Compressor Repair"" he wishes he could fix the ecologically incorrect air conditioner of a girl who deserves to be cool. ""Allahu Akbar"" establishes his material solidarity with the strugglers of Tahrir Square.

Pushing 40 now, Berlin-based Jacksonville native Chad Matheny makes his living as a musician on tours that I assume include residencies--among his many Bandcamp wares is a commissioned work entitled 10,000-Year Earworm to Discourage Habitation Near Nuclear Waste Depositories. But although all his music comes with clean, computer-crafted abstract art, he comes naturally to a frugal, tech-savvy ecology-firster's skepticism of physical product. No surprise then that this is his first actual CD since Bar/None's 2011 Western Teleport--one so obscure or perversely coded it didn't show up on Gracenote when I imported it into my iTunes. Yet it would seem that he does regard physicals as special, because nowhere else does the music feature songs end-to-end instead of sucking you in with a handful and then dematerializing into strummed or noodled jams with vocal accoutrements. True, this one achieves a third of its 50-minute length by means of a quarter-hour of subliminal electropulse at the end of a closer called ""5-Hour Energy, Poland, 2017"" as well as bridging its halves with what is essentially a four-minute vamp. Nevertheless, the 10 songs are songs. All evoke a hard-scrabbling world traveler often caught in but never daunted by border hassles, medical bureaucracy, and crap technology. Bergson and Schopenhauer also come up. Yet amid riots and dodgy bank accounts, Matheny sounds about as chipper as a working musician on a deteriorating planet can. In fact, the whole thing is quite an up if you give it half a chance.

I know more about the French electronic musician Yann Tambour now than when I reviewed Encre's eponymous debut in 2005. I know that that record came out in 2001. I know that he's released three albums and three EPs under the moniker, and that both EPs I've heard, Marbres and Plexus II, are forgettable. I know that he leads another band or unit called Thee, Standing Horse that makes music as stillborn as its horrible name. I know that when I wondered jokingly in my first review whether he was talking about time (fois) or liver (foie), he was probably talking about liver, because the extensive printed lyrics here begin ""Ah mon foie! tu pr?pares un vieux pr?mature"" (""Ah my liver! You prepare a premature old age""). I know I'm not going to translate the rest of those lyrics, which on a casual scan tend passionate and pr?tentieux, and that I'm not going to let them stop me from reporting that Encre is one helluva laptop unit. It's one-man chamber music with a fondness for rhythmic repetition--for hypnotic motives, say--and also, occasionally, percussion. Tambour (the French word for drum, as it happens) plays guitar and kora, but his sonic palette favors chamber quartet sonorities, brief orchestral samples, simple piano figures, and other classical-type materials. Only half the eight songs include lyrics, which Tambour whispers winningly and mysteriously. I hope he's taking care of his liver. But I'd hope harder if he hadn't abandoned Encre for Thee, Standing Horse.

In the studio--live, he has a combo, documented on a less interesting bonus EP--Frenchman Yann Tambour is a solo laptopper whose works are invariably described by the few Anglophones who know they exist as mysterious and depressing. I say they're moody, and note for the record that the mood they evoked on a recent European sojourn was always comforting--notably during a jet-lagged rush hour as we sought lodgings in a language we do not speak on an Appian Way that was more picturesque back in the day. Tambour's music is slow and textural, deploying glitches and ostinatos in the service of a better-grounded groove than is laptop practice. Over this Tambour whispers now and then in a French it's just as well I can't make out, although my multilingual wife believes that on the first track he says either ""there is still a time"" or ""there is still a liver,"" both of which seem chipper enough to me. Unless--uh-oh--it's ""there isn't yet a time"" (or liver). Oh well.

Encre's live album features a five-person group playing versions of Tambour's studio creations, some of them radically reconceived. The big difference is that they rock--the drums are always there, and almost always state a beat. Similarly, the music's louder in general; similarly, there's more guitar; similarly, Tambour oft exclaims where once he whispered. He also cedes one vocal to his female cellist. A laptopper with an outgoing side--we like that.

Known simply as the Beat in England, and rightly so--their ska is deep and driven. Thank drummer Everett Martin, born St. Kitt's 1951, with roots from reggae to Armatrading, and bassist David Steele, born Isle of Wight 1960, who's parlayed the usual classical training into a rhythm kid's twist and crawl. That's a title, of course, naming a bass line that moved more feet than anything Bernard Edwards came up with in 1980. Riding atop the full frontal velocity are two lean, warm, modest voices, almost indistinguishable until Ranking Roger turns up the accent. Hidden below it are songs, most of them by covocalist David Wakeling. Lyric of the electoral year: ""Stand Down Margaret.""

FALSE,A-,Special Beat Service,The English Beat,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3596,"
Careerwise, a conservative move--never has their four-four come on plainer, and when David Wakeling claims it's harder to write about the personal than the political, you're right to figure the songs will prove it. But David Steele can't resist a slight skank, and Everett Martin, who's such a pro he'd do Ringo imitations if they asked him, is also such a pro he can make any groove move. Anyway, Wakeling is always thoughtful about the irrational fear and real danger of letting go. The troubled decency of his modern romance, spilling over now and then into a barely discernible self-disgust, is the exact left-liberal equivalent of his social concern, of use to the great audience as well as the seekers after young lust and high infidelity he's aiming at.

For all his synthesized, metronomic androidism, Eno is more humane than Bryan Ferry--his romanticism less strident, his oddness less devilish. It's nice, too, that in his arch, mellow way the man takes note of the real world from behind the overdubs. Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure. Admittedly, when they're over they're over--you don't flash on them the way you do on ""Cindy Tells Me"" and ""Baby's on Fire."" But that's just his way of being modest.

After years of big-money production jobs and new age environments, we know Eno for a middlebrow dabbler--no longer can he dazzle us with unpretentious impassivity. And if his return to song form seems too easy, well, maybe it was. Nevertheless, this sea of permutation is the followup Another Green World deserved. He's been synthesizing rhythms so long he makes them sound organic--we get not only world-beat echoes but the soul shuffle his singing is now up to. As for the other guy, he hasn't sounded so sure of his ground since he played second fiddle to Lou Reed.

Anybody who thought Another Green World sounded too much like radar blips or musical furniture should definitely avoid this. Me, I consider Another Green World miraculously lyrical and find that this encourages a meditative but secular mood (good for hard bits of writing) more effectively than any of the other rock-identified avant-garde music that's come our way.

To call this album disappointing is to complain that it isn't transcendent. In fact, my objections begin only when he makes transcendence his goal: I don't like the murkiness of the quiet, largely instrumental reflections that take over side two. Dirty sound is functional in loud music, but no matter how much of a ""water album"" this is, the airy specificity of the Another Green World mix might save music like ""Through Hollow Lands"" from the appearance of aimlessness. None of which diminishes side one's oblique, charming tour of the popular rhythms of the day, from Phil Collins's discoid-fusion drumming on ""No One Receiving"" to the dense, deadpan raveup of (find the anagram) ""King's Lead Hat.""

With this forcebeat pioneer now ensconced as new age paterfamilias, his selection (""biased toward my taste"") of ""songs from the period 1973-1977"" is rather more quiet than a rock-and-roller would hope. And the three Another Green World tracks stick out like paradoxes if you happen to be intimate with that complete work. But never think the man doesn't know how to put a record together. Except for the forebodingly atmospheric ""Taking Tiger Mountain,"" these very individual songs stand up as units and unit--certainly a stronger unit than Before and After Science, former home of the forcebeat classic ""King's Lead Hat."" Young people who consider him a mood-music maestro might as well learn their lesson here.

The feel is early Stones, with the very Satan the Stones pimped so pretentiously filling in for Charlie Watts--who else could have guaranteed Roky a victory over Mother Nature, not to mention Father Time?

The first solo album by San Francisco mixmaster Brendan Angelides, who was unknown to me because most mixmasters are, caught my ear before I read its few reviews, several of which compare him unfavorably to NYC gloomster Matthew Dear. Take that as a compliment. Dear's good tracks are well-ordered verse-chorus-verse by comparison, and he feels compelled to sing or intone where Angelides usually lets his textures ooze, thump, and crackle for themselves. This they proceed to do in what strikes this glitch-challenged listener as an exceptionally active and full-bodied manner. Not terribly beaty and almost never fast. Just the kind of weird background music that's guaranteed to engross whenever you lend it both ears.

An amazing story. In 1979, a Paris-based Ivorian bizzer convinced Cuba's state record company to convene a cross-generational all-star band, and for a week some 30 musicians and over a dozen singers jammed in combinations dictated by a trombone-playing a&amp;r man. The five albums that resulted stiffed in Cuba. But don't think the jams didn't jell. These two CDs, a mere 14 cuts lasting two-and-a-half hours, grant a second life to what was obviously a blessed event. Simple heads-plus-improvs dominated by tres and violins, the first disc is one of those rare records that nail such pieties as the joy of music-making and the pleasure of the groove. The convergence of relaxation and exhilaration, teamwork and exhibitionism, skill and fun, is nothing less than utopian, which in Cuba, where utopia was a bitter memory, may have been hard to take. The second disc overemphasizes the strident trumpets adored by Cubans who want to be modern. The first one makes me want to send Ry Cooder an ironic thank-you note.

That's this short-lived, hot-headed Senegalese crew, who undertook the literally garage-recorded ""Boubou N'Gary,"" all unkempt echoplexed fuzzbox and excitable tama, to give their old boss Youssou N'Dour what for, and began hearing it on the radio--constantly--about two hours after they'd finished.

Where on the aptly entitled World of Noise the sharpest lyrics never quite mesh, here almost every song comes with a story, a tune, and a musical pain threshold.

The corn he indulges on this fondly detailed end-of-a-marriage song cycle has nothing to do with abstracted teen agony and everything with classic Garth Brooks, except that Garth never waxed nostalgic for the days he and his honey whiled away watching porn and eating Chinese. Laying on strings, horns, synths, and backup vocals to a fare-thee-well, it makes honest peace with a pop moment when honest pop is the toughest artistic challenge there is. Volume two will supposedly return to the guitar-o-rama of his roots--without any loss of principle, one trusts.

Rod Stewart sings lead only half of the time, which gives Ronnie Lane a chance to prove himself--his ""You're So Rude"" is a better (funnier and warmer) song about getting laid than ""Stay With Me."" Other standouts include the story of how Rod's brother became a hippie and a version of ""Memphis"" that's a gift from a band that has tightened up just enough.

I was on this from the day I played the import because, like Rai Rebels, it kicks off with her 1985 comeback with her husband Cheb Sahraoui--""N'Sel Fik,"" rai's most incandescent and universal moment, one of the greatest singles of the decade. But it took me months to sort it out clearly in my uneducated recollection from Middle Eastern product as distinct as Ouardia's Berber songpoems, or Ofra Haza's Barbra Streisand gone ethnic and song-contest-with-hip-beats. Now I hear shades of emotion I don't ordinarily get from foreign-language pop--something as elementary as the way ""Ateni Bniti"" (""Give Me Back My Daughter"") moves from affliction to angry resolve, say. I also notice Oran superproducer Rachid outdoing rather than compromising himself as he aims for the bigger time. And reflect that if now it's for bad boys, rai was originally the domain of women who knew better. Fadela sounds like a sister.

Whose examples of how ""I'm Not the Same Without You"" include a spontaneous facelift and an extra inch in height? This is cynicism lite swung tite. You'll grow to love the queen of Bowlmor Lanes, the Jazz Age gangster who takes pride in his work, the souvenirs of dooms past rusting in the back of the sci-fi shop.

The catch-phrase I like best for his deliberate acoustic style gets its '50s-collegiate pretensions and folk/not-folk ambivalence: ""existentialist guitar."" A record collector who bases many songs on treasured blues and string-band obscurities, he also cops from Saint-Saens, rock 'n' roll, Christian hymns, Hindu hymns, and what-have-you to construct a late-night music untouched by lyrics or speed: spacy and contemplative, yet with an implacable common touch. True enough, Fahey's pioneering DIY label, named after Takoma Park, the D.C. suburb he called home, was where George Winston got his start. But after two decades of asking myself why he's any better than Leo Kottke I've decided it's a spiritual thing--he's maintained a direct line to his inner amateur. For two whole CDs, definitely not boring. Just close enough to make you question the category.

Folk-rock is a doubly willful idea in England--our bluegrass and acoustic blues are closer to rock than their Child ballads. And Fairport's eleven-minute version of ""A Sailor's Life"" doesn't come up to the three Dylan songs (one in French) or Richard Thompson's quite un-English ""Cajun Woman."" But they do inject a droning energy into the material that suggests real synthesis. Thanks be to Thompson's guitar, Dave Mattacks's drums, and Sandy Denny's fondness for booze.

Instead we get tasty Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson oddments, including Dion and Gordon Lightfoot transmuted into impure English folk. The trans-Atlantic connection dominates only one side--my favorite, needless to say. But ""Tam Lin"" sounds weirder in conjunction with ""Percy's Song,"" ""Walk Awhile"" merrier in conjunction with ""Come All Ye,"" ""Farewell, Farewell"" more final at the end of four progressively doomier sides. In short, an intelligent compilation. Great notes, too.

A punk-disco fusion so uncompromised it will scare away fans of both genres, which share a taste for nasty girls that rarely extends to females past thirty with rat's-nest hair and last night's makeup on. The raw dance music isn't exactly original, and sometimes the offhandedness of the lyrics can be annoying, but I like this even when it's pro forma and/or sloppy, or maybe because it's pro forma and/or sloppy, like Dylan when he's good. ""Why'd ya spit on my snatch?"" indeed--the music's harshest account of a woman fending with the world.

Scornful of the notion that realism entered pop music with rock and roll (a/k/a ""the blues""), Hal Willner introduces Faithfull to a world-weary band of Lou Reed/Tom Waits sessioneers and hopes everybody'll like the same songs he does--by Leadbelly and Henry Glover, by Dylan and Jagger-Richard, but also by Kern and Dubin-Warren. The result can rightfully be called rock Billie Holiday. Faithfull's nicotine-cured voice serves the material instead of triumphing over it; its musicality equals its interpretive intelligence. Just because she's jaded doesn't mean she can't be a little wise.

Yet though even the new Patti Smith cover has nothing on ""Broken English"" or ""Why D'Ya Do It,"" every more recent song (as well as the iconic twice-15-year-old Jagger-Richards ingenue move ""As Tears Go By"") beats Broken English's filler. So slice it this way. For the first half she's a wreck, spitting imprecations at the world. During the second she regains her dignity.

Yet from the opening nag--""Check the record, check the record, check the guy's track [later 'rock'] record""--small strokes keep me turning this one up.

Beginning, naturally, with the least catchy thing on the record (it came first, and who are they to deny history?), this singles compilation spans the entirety of Brix Smith's controversial (especially if you're an old friend of Mark's) tenure with the eternal U.K. art punks. Their drones don't resolve or climax or even pick up speed, yet though Mark's said to be a poet, they're not just there for the words, many of them undecodable--they're there for the drones.

In any case, the first half regales and/or lacerates with the mad purity and/or skeptical hilarity Mark E. Smith was put on the planet to take to his grave. Recorded with Los Angeles pickup musicians, although now I guess we just call them the Fall, immediately after his band of seven years ditched him in Phoenix, it states its business out of the box: ""I think it's over now I think it's ending/I think it's over now I think it's beginning.""

That's why the Markovic catalog has always driven your faithful marginal differentiator crazy. But though said differentiator has never heard a Ciocarlia album he didn't like, including 2016's Onward to Mars with the zippy ""Crayfish Hora"" opener you won't find here, he believes you can make do with two: the guest-studded live 2007 memorial concert Queens &amp; Kings, and this vinyl-and-download-only double album, which cherrypicks a catalog they were accruing long before vinyl fetishism became a thing. Trad though they are, they began recording well into the CD era in 1996. Gili Garabdi owners should be aware that that 2005 breakthrough provides seven of its 26 tracks, but what can you do?

Sounds unmusical but it isn't that either--the singing is clever and impassioned, the punkish, futuristic reggae-synthesizer fusion often catchy and always apt. If only I were a post-Marcusian myself I'd be in heaven. And a second side as good as the first might convert me.

They won't ever be great rappers technically, though Prince Markie Dee has the poise and clarity to get close and the bass-kazoo hums and belchlike aspirations of the Human Beat Box show rhythmic instinct and sonic imagination. But their shambling, cheerful fat-boy dance is a party for kids of all ages. I love the hooks on ""Fat Boys"" and the barks on ""Don't You Dog Me,"" and if ""Jail House Rap"" is no ""Message"" or ""Hustler's Convention,"" neither is it a trivialization--at least as silly and serious as Lee Dorsey in the coal mine or Sam Cooke on the chain gang.

Or much alt, come to think on it. Mostly he recounts sexual-romantic and other contretemps--not conquests, not adventures, just situations, humanely and humorously understood, which some might say is kind of African after all. Even the lovely ""Father's Day"" has that vibe. The beats by his man Tom Cruz skip explicit melody to achieve textural continuity with electronically simulated and approximated drums, shakers, scrapers, and the like.

The title finale spends six minutes celebrating his favorite hang, which is at its sweetest on a Sunday that rhymes with ""fun day"" even if there was that knucklehead who stepped to him and it came to blows--but not, notice, gunplay. MacGregor Park anchors Tony's Third Ward hang in Houston, and from NYC I get the impression it could pass for a safe space.

But though ""One Hand Loose"" and ""Tongue-Tied Jill"" are pretty great, only nuts need Kay Records' generically rockacountry Jungle Fever comp. So this is a shock. Although ""Mean Woman Blues"" rocks out like Robert Gordon and Billy Hancock wish, Feathers refuses to insult anyone's intelligence pretending he's horny as a teenager, putting his past behind him in the forlorn collection of old song titles ""We Can't Seem To Remember To Forget.""

Jeb Loy Nichols is a singer of helpless, studied nasality whose reference points are country, dub, and '70s soul, none of which he deems incompatible with the Carpenters or George Gershwin. And although on his third album he leaves class war to Gregory Isaacs's ""Poor and Clean,"" he's also a lefty. In short, he's about as commercial as a Swedenborgian schismatic on public access. And so, with nothing to lose except a few creations that might otherwise fail to survive any posterity whatsoever, he puts 16 songs on a mournful, unhurried, all too hypnotic 65-minute CD. It could use some pruning, but the guy writes better all the time, with domestic epiphany, romantic resignation, and everyday fatigue his specialties.

Fender's catalog will always be a mess--because he recorded too much, because Huey Meaux will license to anyone, because no one will ever compile his deeply felt ""How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,"" because his ""Junko Partner"" has gone the way of all dope legends. Dot/MCA's The Best of Freddy Fender accesses his late-'70s country-chart phase, whereas this best, while prudently providing alternate takes of ""Wasted Days and Wasted Nights"" and ""Before the Next Teardrop Falls,"" lovingly samples the Meaux-produced rest. Included are a regional rock and roll hit from before his just-past-21 1960 drug bust, a creaky Johnny Ace cover, a rollicking ""Fannie Mae,"" a circa-1980 remake of the Who's ""Squeeze Box,"" and a ""Chokin' Kind"" in which Fender ignores the title apostrophe and sings ""If you don't like the peaches walk on by the tree"" as if Shakespeare had written it just for him. Though Fender's tenor is sharp rather than mellow, the closest analogy is Aaron Neville, who even when he was good was less innocent, who remains more spiritual if less sublime, and who doesn't break into Spanish for his supper.

She knows two or three melodies, she sings flat, she phrases every line the same, she can get pretty gauche lyrically, and in most of this she reminds me more than a little of, I'm sorry, the young Bob Dylan. The repetitious insistence of her most powerful songs drives home her commitment to folkie usages that in other women's music practitioners sound pat, purist, and out of it, and a shifting pool of (male and female) backup players provides the variety. From her smokily confessional introspection to her habitual occultism to her eight-minute, eight-stanza ""It Won't Take Long"" (""it"" being the Revolution or something similar), her bullshit is her own.

By transforming Dylan at his most messianic into gripping high camp complete with sound effects (when the poet dies in the gutter the chorus gives forth with a cute groan), Ferry both undercuts the inflated idealism of the original and reaffirms its essential power. Along the way, he also establishes ""It's My Party"" as a protest song. And just in case we're getting any highfalutin ideas, the title track reminds us that pop is only, well, foolish things, many of which predate not only Andy Warhol but rock and roll itself.

On a solo debut by the woman who's the reason you liked that Knife album against your better judgment? These are not songs about how depressed Karin Dreijer Andersson is, though the long winter does get Scandinavians down. They're songs about the destructiveness of greed, the difficulties of nurturance, and the very real adjustments every human must make from the dreams of youth to the constrictions of adulthood, which in my lifetime have never been worse than they are right now. As good as it gets: ""Work as I've been told/In return I get money/Small feet in the hall/And I long for every moment.""

Karin Dreijer's solo debut was about money when you listened up. This long-aborning follow-up is about sex. The tentative openers ""Wanna Sip"" and ""Mustn't Hurry"" end up where she and you had hoped before concerns about unsafe spaces and fraught hookups culminate with the free-abortion-on-demand ""This Country"": ""This country""--and she means Sweden!--""makes it hard to fuck."" Yet strangely or maybe not, that attack of nerves is the turning point. Immediately the title instrumental leads directly to ""I want to run my fingers up your pussy"" and an open if complicated beyond. Take the plunge, she's hinting. It'll be fine. You'll be glad you did.

Why do so many rappers of the everyday come from Chicago? Fiasco follows Common, Capital D, Rhymefest and of course his homey Kanye West, who is definitely part of the explanation. Though I wish the beats were less corny-orchestral, Fiasco marks his own turf in a three-song sequence that would have led the second side back in the day. The not-quite-nightmarish ""Daydreamin',"" the thug-life-after-death fable ""The Cool"" and the free-accelerating ""Hurt Me Soul,"" which begins with Too Short calling women bitches and ends in the geopolitical sinkhole we all inhabit, prove it isn't just realists who describe real life. And the two takes on his signature ""Kick Push"" hope that everyday life isn't always a sinkhole.

Angry at the record company, angry at a racist society, not sure they're different, Too Smart throws up his hands and down his gantlet and generates a music-driven album in which violin interludes named after the seasons separate long stretches of associative protest poetry, detailing prison and hood sociology that's scarier than you expect because you thought you already knew that shit. The two strongest tracks begin the winter section: ""Choppers,"" about buying filet mignon with your food stamps and healthcare from Obama, and ""Delivery,"" about how hard it is to order crap pizza in a place where people get shot. But ""Prisoner 1 &amp; 2"" could mess up your mind as well. The final interlude is called ""Spring,"" only it's not an interlude. It's the end. Nothing follows.

It's pretentious to complain that this musically agile, intellectually ambitious rapper has undertaken a concept trilogy that doesn't justify its pretensions. Really, why pretend there was any chance it would? Instead honor the two uncommon things this second installment does accomplish. First is a flow that never falters no matter how dense the themes--a flow that accommodates such verbiage as ""conjurer"" and ""iridescent,"" ""breach"" and ""havoc,"" ""synonym"" and ""anthropomorphic,"" ""industrialist"" and ""socialism."" The second is that among these two dozen good-to-excellent tracks are at least four whose pitch of emotion and ambition render them something like profound: ""WAV Files,"" which constructs a stanza from the names of slave ships, ""Down,"" which creates a mythology of subaquatic African immortals consigned to the sea by shipwreck or their own leaps of faith, and alternate-universe biographies of two children cut down before they'd barely begun their lives, the drowned refugee ""Alan Forever"" and the street-slain innocent ""Jonylah Forever."" Fiasco should interrogate his weakness for consumer goods and study anti-Semitism's meaning as a term and history as a blight on humanity. But we're lucky the big label dumped him, and he is too.

Before that happy ending they address such excellent paranoid themes as online investment, superglue, and that old reliable, the weather.

Rhino's Ed Ward-picked Monkey Hips and Rice exemplifies the compiler's craft. It doesn't rank with Robert Palmer's Elmore James or Ken Braun's Franco only because the 5 Royales aren't quite in that league. But these North Carolinians certainly outshone such oft-mourned '50s also-rans as Charlie Feathers and Orioles, as anyone who owns Ward's long-deleted 1995 comp is aware. Anyone who doesn't, however, may be put off by collector prices that start at $45 for two used CDs and quickly rise into triple figures. So here's a starter kit, which adds 11 good-to-excellent tracks to 14 of the 41 keepers Ward chose. Presumably the idea was to target doowop nuts, who like things slow, and skip uptempo finds--although not such essentials as ""The Slummer the Slum"" or ""Monkey Hips and Rice."" Even the more generic new selections demonstrate that Lowman Pauling wasn't the group's only weapon--singer Johnny Tanner presages doowop's evolution into soul with a lot less market calculation than Ben E. King. And it's really too bad Ward didn't squeeze in the four-minute group workout ""I'm With You"" or the barely articulate ""My Wants for Love,"" where Johnny lets his brother Eugene grab the lead and the opportunity moves him very much.

As hilarious sobersides from multiple generations charge indignantly that the Lips and their various beards fail to ""interpret"" the songs, all three modes of deconstruction are in play on this grand hoot of a fore-to-aft remake. Highlights for me include a theme statement that gains meanings it never had from its attendant distortions, a creaky ""When I'm Sixty-Four,"" Miley Cyrus so sweet on ""Lucy in the Sky,"" and Julianna Barwick adding just what ""She's Leaving Home"" cries out for--a female voice.

With a musical saw for theremin effects, their wide-open spaceyness was released eight-track only, and soon a subway troubadour and an architect and a disciple of Guru Mararaji had disappeared back into the diaspora. In cowpunk/neofolk/psychedelic-revival retrospect, they're neotraditionalists who find small comfort in the past, responding guilelessly and unnostalgically to the facts of displacement in a global village that includes among its precincts the high Texas plains. They're at home. And they're lost anyway.

Rejecting Afropop for village musicians and/or homegrown preservationists, Fleck brings in some impressive second attractions for the cut or two they're worth--Malagasay man of the world D'Gary, South African go-getter Vusi Mahlasela, Malian super-sideman Afel Bacoum. He gets on with Oumou Sangare, overdubs welcome soloists into a D'Gary jam recorded in Nashville, duets with a balafon so huge it's commandeered by 35 Ugandans, showcases a blind mbira master who sings like a bird on a song about singing like a radio. Nine tracks from Uganda and Tanzania and none from Nigeria or Congo is funny demographics and the album tails off into debt paying and musicianly hypersubtlety.

Why is this Fleetwood Mac album different from all other Fleetwood Mac albums?

Live harp to live bass to looped/sampled beats; bassy dream-pop to jazz scat to chipmunk space-kitsch. Part of its delight is how naturally the disparate parts fit together, but another part is how they add up to phantasmagoria if you let your attention wander (and don't be a tight-ass--you should).

The initial temptation is to gush over how trip-hoppy Carl Stephenson was ere world or underworld heard tell of Tricky or DJ Shadow. But in fact this 1993 recording shows its age, most tellingly by assuming that tunes are a good thing. Stephenson cut his studio chops producing rappers--first with the Geto Boys, then the College Boyz, whose hunger for hits transcended petty differences. So when he entered the rock world, he saw no reason to believe that texture and melody were mutually exclusive. And if it turns out that this was naive, well, naivete is one thing that makes this obsession disguised as an album so appealing. Finally, we who prefer Mellow Gold to Odelay have a good idea why.

That's how it was after the band reunited in 2000--ultimately, Forster's sensible, prosaic voice struck home and stuck with you. There are no love songs as that term is usually understood here--just a solemn track about the perils of moving one's wife from the German forest to the Australian desert, a cheerful one about hooking up with a relocated mother and child at church, a lively one about the dead friend he'll mourn till he's dead himself.

It works best on ""A Poet Walks,"" where the artist's ordinary stroll through the city doing ordinary things that make him better than you is accessorized with mariachi el-toro trumpet at the close, and ""And I Knew,"" about the love he was certain destiny would impart if he undertook to travel 10,000 miles and wait till it happened--the last quarter of which repeats the phrase ""and I knew"" over and over (and over).

Keys and strings go their own merry way toward the same pretty, toylike goal, and though the drums grumble sometimes, they can be counted on to help their friends the glitches in a pinch. The computer as music box--which is what guys like Hebden think it is, after all.

FALSE,A-,Everything Ecstatic,Four Tet,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12927,"
Kieran Hebden does pack a lot of ideas, or maybe they're really just sounds, into a song, or maybe the term is album cut. But he's always lyrical. There's never that Conlon-Nancarrow-meets-Squarepusher sense of machine-scale speed exploited to evoke the workings of a mind that should take it easy already. Rounds was so lyrical, in fact, that it drove genre obsessives to the neologism ""folktronica."" Many such folks are disquieted by Hebden's constitutionally protected decision to dabble in the usages of drum'n'bass, which are every laptopper's roots, after all. The drums get busy at times, but never fear--this sounds more like Rounds than it does like anything else. Just a little funkier.

FALSE,A-,Fake Yoga,Foxymorons,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16673,"
On their fifth album in 21 years, two Dallas pop-punk hobbyists and/or perfectionists attain the pop-punk grail: 10 tough, catchy, ebullient, stealth-strange songs in 32 minutes, dudless unless you count the dirgey change-of-pace novelty ""The People"" and fast unless you refuse to accept the closer for the summum it is. Summumming what exactly I cannot say, although such topics as the rewards of sentience, cherry lips in a permanent frown, drugs and hugs, and pop-punk nerds bullied on the schoolbus definitely arise. What signifies is that tunes abound, as do musical jokes. Let's just figure out what it all means when they do it again.

FALSE,A-,African Classics,Franco,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14155,"
Guitarist-vocalist-bandleader-force majeure Luambo Franco recorded all the time. But in the dire tradition of both dictatorship and imperialism, the catalogue of the greatest African musician of the 20th century comprises many dozens of albums and many hundreds of songs whose availability wanes and waxes and then wanes again. So who knows how long this lovely and riveting mess of a double-CD will be around? It shares a mere four duplications with the Manteca and Rough Guide best-ofs you should buy first. It lists who's singing (14 African idols overall, Franco usually included) and playing guitar (on 16 out of 23 songs, not just the big man but bespectacled hitmaker Simaro). Its main negative is its incomprehensibly unchronological track order. Its great prize is all 17 minutes of the deeply gorgeous ""Trï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"" which does nothing but insult an unnamed somebody right down to, as biographer Graeme Ewens puts it, his ""smelly armpits and dirty socks.""

FALSE,A-,Love All the Hurt Away,Aretha Franklin,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=154,"
This is her best pop album since Young, Gifted and Black because it's her best groove album since Spirit in the Dark. The swinging, streaming, Quincy Jonesish dance pulse of (no getting around it) Toto (though Arif Mardin did have the smarts to add Jacksons vet Greg Philinganes) even helps her through jivy remakes of ""Hold On I'm Coming"" and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" on side one. But side two is, as Aretha puts it in her candid ""Whole Lot of Me,"" the ""cream de la cream"": for once her voice is as rich and confident as it always has every right to be, and Aretha asserts her needs and prerogatives as if they go with the flow. Which they do.

At 72 her voice has lost range and clarity, so if athleticism is your thing, maybe you'd better go buy that Whitney's greatest live excrescence I couldn't get past track six of. With Aretha I always thought vocal quality trumped vocal ability--the latter merely extraordinary, the former unfathomable. At present, the voice has taken on a squall I identify with Bobby Bland and hear in Mahalia Jackson too--a phlegmy, self-possessed, powerful, interesting old person's voice. The interpretations aren't definitive--Etta James still owns ""At Last,"" there are better ""Teach Me Tonight""s, and although Aretha's ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" is her own, Sinead's remains not only definitive but stranger and better. And although I get how jealous she is of Barbra Streisand and Ms. Houston, I still don't ever want to hear ""People"" or ""I'm Every Woman"" again. Yet somehow, when I let my guard down, I catch myself chuckling over how she floats and rocks and skirls and squalls through each of them. And I hope neither Gloria Gaynor nor Adele Adkins is too much of a diva not to be tickled by ""Rolling in the Deep"" and ""I Will Survive,"" regal interpolations and all.

They've gotten unmistakably louder and unmistakably gayer--or perhaps I mean, hate the term, more metrosexual, given that the most affecting song here is a plea to a Brooklyn girl to rush her ass to Scotland. Small shows of force are all this ex-alt unit needs to achieve the meaning curmudgeons demand of rudderless guitar bands. They define themselves when they declare--not howl, not brag, declare--""I'm evil and a heathen."" Firmly secular on their shaky pop pinnacle, they're a beacon.

Freeman's previous albums have been pretentious and often static. This one sounds like jazz, and though Freeman's embouchure is thin, his compleatly eclectic concept gets over on the heads and improvs alone. ""Wilpan's Walk"" is Blue Note for the '80s, ""Crossing the Sudan"" bows toward Pharoah, ""C &amp; M"" is as eventful as a Muhal piece because it is one, and ""Embracing Oneness"" does its best to show Duke and Thelonious the Way, though I myself doubt that they're listening.

First side's got the skewed songcraft you'd hope, second the avant-folk excursions you'd fear, and both outdo anything you'd dare expect. Despite the prolonged ""Drowned Dog Black Night,"" first side's also the strongest Thompson since he elected to pursue his solo dick. Good that he doesn't have to do it all--from French's wacky ""Wings ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"" to the collective demolition of ""Surfin' USA,"" it's an ad hoc collaboration that sounds as good as it reads. As for the excursions, well, renowned guitarist Thompson exercises a restraining influence on wealthy plectrum enthusiast Kaiser. Maybe next time they'll persuade Frith to put down his fiddle and join them in a fifteen-minute ""Free Bird.""

FALSE,A-,This Land,Bill Frisell,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=305,"
For the groove-minded, Frisell is a frustrating case. Unlike so many jazz guitarists, he can get loud and rock out, but for him those are but two compositional options in the grand plethora. So while most of his albums are graced by great moments or nice mood, in the end I'm too rhythm-bound to want any part of the new live one or the two new soundtracks or the one where he covers Madonna or (especially) the one where he falls for a synthesizer. This beautifully constructed sextet record I come back to. It rocks out primarily by association; in fact, many of the avant-garde rags and elegiac ballads feel early 20th-century as they bounce off each other like motives in a symphony. But as is often claimed and seldom achieved, the sheer sound of a few bars of guitar can evoke the whole electric blues gestalt, just as the alto-trombone-clarinet combo can evoke all horns. On his Madonna record Frisell also covered Aaron Copland, who I keep meaning to get to. In the meantime I have this.

The former Jonny Corndawg doffs his cartoon face but continues to wear his cartoon voice, probably because he owns no other. Object: album that presents him as an ordinary Southern-accented male with an unusually high-strung larynx who goes to bars and forgets the garbage and bathes in the holy pool of the Mount of Venus and catches sick and drives 250 miles to get tossed from your birthday party just like any other fella. And oh yeah, who's got relationship problems so depressing that he thinks calmly about killing himself. Yet even that doesn't stop him from saying what he has to say in under three minutes, with a catchy tune to help the time pass.

The fourth and best-by-a-mile folk-rock album from sometime Shin Eric Johnson and his cud-chewing sidemen is a message to the freak-folk from ""a broke-legged paint in a herd full of unicorns."" With kind melodies and pointed wordplay, he sings the abiding skepticism of someone who believes we live again as soil, not soul. With a sweetness firmly attached to the things of this world, he celebrates the granite peak, the will-o'-the-wisp, and too much love.

Less dynamic and more ruminative than The Ruminant Band, here are 10 songs and a poky instrumental for country hippies manque and other shaggy folk down on the little luck they ever had. All are lost, some more than others, but each is observed and distinct. Eric Johnson's falsetto cuts extreme empathy with moderate unction until he starts ruminating for real with the instrumental, which lasts two minutes and goes on forever. Then he seeks purity for four. There's another song too.

From the unyielding strictures of Minor Threat's straight-edge hardcore to the confrontational formalism of Fugazi's surgical AOR, Ian MacKaye is a musical puritan as well as all the other kinds. Obsessed with corruption, he's learned that words and voices don't excise it as efficiently as a well-honed guitar. So if the rock-solid precision of Guy Picciotto's distorto riffs offer something like pleasure, that's a contradiction MacKaye will have to live with, because Picciotto is the star of a unit that no matter what you read is just now coming on.

FALSE,A-,Songs from a Portable Forest,The Fugs,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3624,"
Ed Sanders is a Romantic who's outlived his wild days without disowning or betraying them. As a young Fug, he affected comic hippie raunch; solo, he half-realized a pseudohillbilly twang. But pushing 50 in a group that reunited for an antinuke rally, he sings all prettified like the tree-hugging published poet he is. And it's his singing that turns these 12 unjokey songs from the Fugs' three '80s imports into nothing you've heard before. Sanders's care, compassion, and, yes, sensitivity are credible even when he's comparing protesters to Prometheus--the seven-part, 11-minute lifework ""Dreams of Sexual Perfection"" has William Blake coming in his grave. You almost begin to think any spiritually advanced rockpoet could do this--until Leslie Ritter's Maria-McKee-as-Joan-Baez contralto turns Sanders's ""World Wide Green"" into a pompous preachment and brings you back to earth.

If I had any principles I'd carp as usual. Why not excise what a neutral observer would reasonably judge unlistenable--tuneless ""Ah, Sunflower,"" contract discussion, Warhol raspberries--and fold in the undeniable likes of ""Kill for Peace"" and ""Morning Morning"" from the The Fugs Second Album, which comes complete with echo, vocal harmonies, actual lead guitar? Or better still, let Rhino mine the un-CD'ed Warner catalogue for a best-of permanently establishing their right to make fun of Andy, whose gossip squad still disses these latter-day beatniks with catty bohemian-sectarian condescension. Well, sometimes history is its own reward. The counterculture the Fugs inhabit is fascinating even when it isn't entertaining, and educational both ways. Not only do they bury most Kerouac, but their prerock music--with Peter Stampfel chiming in, Ken Weaver not yet a burlier Spencer Dryden, and (crucially) Tuli Kupferberg's songs at the forefront--rides the homemade charm and unsullied aura of discovery lo-fi sentimentalists think they're living for.

Here's more inspiring evidence of a hippie's progress than anything Joni Mitchell or Mickey Hart will ever again devise. An accomplished folk-rock band fronted by Woodstock-based activist Ed Sanders with sardonic history alerts from Manhattan-based anarchist-comedian Tuli Kupferberg, the Fugs Mark II still joke-check their ribald heyday, and on the live tracks you can hear their tiny fan base eat up every laugh line. But with the support of those fans, Sanders is onto bigger things. Free of bitterness and regret, savvier than he ever was about the ins and outs of make-love-not-war, and a poet above all, his motto is ""refuse to be burnt out."" Googly-eyed neotribalists who consider ""psychedelic"" a meaningful term owe it to themselves and their parents to consider the musical teachings of Allen Ginsberg's great inheritor.

FALSE,A-,Georgia Hard,Robbie Fulks,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12894,"
Vocally, he's neither here nor there--by the standards of Jay Farrar, Trace Adkins, but by the standards of Trace Adkins, Todd Snider--and as a writer he's caught between Tootsie's Orchid Lounge and Columbia University, where he's spent more time. He has a lit major's love for Music Row convention: ""Some people say a real hard woman's good to find,"" or the evolution of the ""they"" in ""If They Could Only See Me Now"" from the parents who didn't want him to marry above his station to the kids he can't see after he murders their mama. Because he doesn't have the physical equipment to put his formal hyperbole over the top, his novelties connect first--""I'm Going to Take You Home (And Make You Like Me),"" featuring his wife Donna, and the first recorded use of the word gemutlichkeit in a country song, and ""Countrier Than Thou,"" featuring an Oh! Brother fan from Boston and GWB from Austin. But on this record the writing is so consistent that eventually it makes emotional sense--the cheating songs and the drinking songs and the faux gothic songs are set pieces he puts his gumption into, softened by a pastoral nostalgia that's so lyrical you want to take a ride in the country yourself.

Lest you suspect that Fulks has fallen victim to loser mythology, ""Where I Fell"" at track two leads to ""That's Where I'm From"" at track four. First one's a politico-economically sapient tale of drinking won't kill you and rust never sleeps, the second the reflections of a night-school whiz who's climbed from dirt roads and double-wides to two cars and a picket fence--he's sure he did right, proud even, but he also has regrets. You think maybe Luke Bryan would cover this diptych? How about either half of it?  Me neither. Oh well--Fulks sings better than Bryan anyway.

The group that makes the Ohio Players sound like the Mike Curb Congregation still has a disturbingly occultish bent--""free from the need to be free,"" indeed. But at this point I'm inclined to trust the music, which is tough-minded, outlandish, very danceable, and finally, I think (and hope), liberating. Including a Stevie Wonder ripoff and a Jimi Hendrix impression and a Black Sabbath love song and a long Bach organ coda (""Atmosphere,"" by Clinton-Shider-Worrell) over a rap that begins: ""I hate the word pussy, it sounds awful squishy, so I guess I'll call it clit.""

After ""Can You Get to That,"" ""Loose Booty,"" and ""Funky Dollar Bill,"" which really are great, I'm ready to believe that ""A Joyful Process"" is balanced on an Ellingtonian paradox rather than immersed in schlocky pretensions. But the selection could be even better, and because Funkadelic is a groove band rather than a song band it's not very well-served by the ""hit"" format. In short, this is hardly the perfect Funkadelic LP. And in truth, neither are any of the others.

A good sample of their surrealistic black vaudeville, this offers none of the great climaxes of their Westbound albums--no come shots, you might say--but an abundance of good old-fashioned raunch. As consistent as any album they've made, it's dense with ensemble funk and catchy riffsongs, post-heavy Mike Hampton guitar and post-backlash soul voicings. And it rescues from the public domain not only middle-period Jimmy Page but ""Comin' 'Round the Mountain"" and ""They Don't Wear Pants on the Sunny Side of France.""

His embattled empire/utopia in pieces around if not against him, George Clinton reaches into the disgusting depths of his drug-addled mind and comes up with the solidest, weirdest chunk of P-Funk since one nation gathered under a groove. Featuring icky sex, Sly getting stronger, and an on-the-one reggae about digging ""the first world"" that should make his brethren and sistren (way) down south splank their spliffs. In short, chock-a-block, for which we can thank the baddies at Warner Brethren, who forced him to reduce a projected double-LP down to this supersaturated single.

FALSE,A-,The Year of No Returning,Ezra Furman,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16046,"
Rather than lyrics, the text accompanying this solo debut features a lengthy statement of principle: the Chicago folk-rocker (sorry, but that brutal shorthand reveals more than the one-sheet's ""dark chamber pop, tough-guy garage rock and sad, gorgeous balladry"") aims for ""real protest"" against our ""globally pervasive culture."" Or as Furman puts it in ""American Soil"": ""I'm a Jew through and through and I'm about to write you a Bible."" Fortunately, he sets his sacrilegious writ to muscular melodies that get more fetching as they speed up, accompanied by his admittedly garageish guitar and musicians admittedly more chamber-pop than were his helpers in the Harpoons. Taken by the style of anxiety built into a voice that rises in pitch as a matter of well-calibrated habit, I wish I could report that it sang of global contradiction more and romantic frustration less. But for now it's global enough. Furman is right to believe that too few of his cohort risk this kind of pretension, a/k/a the good kind.

The frenetic escape saga ""Suck the Blood From My Wound"" sets an emotional pace the album can't possibly sustain, but an underlying metaphor provides all the momentum it needs--the angel Furman is on the run with has had serious wing surgery and the authorities mean to get him for it. So in picaresque desperation Furman and/or his half-tinfoil lover/confederate hide out in a beach house and spend a sleepless night in an Arkansas trailer park, recite a prayer in Hebrew and steal a dress from Goodwill. Furman remains vulnerable yet indomitable throughout, indulging an appetite for life that respects both its sanctity and its friability. Think of him as an alternate version of your better self.

Armchair zucchinis with dreams of multiculti deconstruction have been on the lookout for these guys--rappers whose visions of fun, agape, and aural conquest remain open-ended, playful, and, face it, silly.

You want an inkling of how grim things are for black kids right now, try and find another current rap record that manages to mean a damn thing without slipping into gangsta suicide or Afrocentric cryptoracism. Since this one sank faster than Public Enemy, maybe it doesn't mean much either, but to me the East Flatbush trio radiates the hope hip hop was full of not so long ago. There's deep pleasure in their vocal tradeoffs and hard, wryly textured tracks. There's wordwise grace in rhymes that balance B-movie fantasy against everyday brutality without denial or despair. And there's joy in the nonpareil skills of reformed backward rapper Chip Fu. He coughs, he hiccups, he snorts, he stutters; he whinnies, wheezes, wows, and flutters.

So maybe you'll try four from CD A and four from CD B, including the pace-setting ""La Schmoove"" and the impossible ""Sum Dum Monkey,"" a speed-rapped run of sonic laugh lines so virtuosic it rockets beyond double-dare-you into a realm of ludic delight where few dare follow.

Not that the departed Ciara is first cause of Future's beat-steeped lassitude. First cause is he's a junkie, addicted to the liquid scag crack magnates and FruityLoops prodigies mix with carbonated beverages so as to forget their demons--and believe that Future mentions ""hell"" and ""the devil"" more than your average syrup sipper. Does his life ever not sound like fun. I'm sure he fucks a lot, as in the echoing Metro Boomin' showpiece ""Groupies"" or the semiconscious ""The Stripper and Percocet Joint."" But does he come? Opiates, after all, are notoriously anorgasmic, and while he does once resort to the term ""make love,"" the porn tracks are long on domination and athletic ability and the exception is ""Rich Sex,"" about the special frisson of coitus with your chains on. In another inconsistency--he is large, he fucks up commas--one song does insist, ""I'm just enjoying my life."" And no doubt many of his poor fans believe him. But I don't. If only our deluded nation took hip-hop seriously, this miserable minor masterpiece would be all the proof we needed that money can't buy happiness.

The flow seems effortlessly idiomatic, only not South Asian idiomatic, whatever that would sound like besides Heems. The rhymes bespeak a brainy slacker with an analysis underway, only he's watched so much porn and heard so much hip-hop that he's dumber than need be about sex.

What I love about their records is the very thing that keeps me from playing them much--the guitars are so harsh, the rhythms so skewed, the voices so hectoring, the lyrics so programmatic that they function as a critique of casual hedonism. Their pleasure is like Barthes or forward bends--good for you, in a limited way. So while it's all right in theory for ""I Love a Man in a Uniform"" to make me think I've been underrating the Human League every time its intro makes me want to get up and dance, I don't find such amenities formally appropriate.

As they add the quaver of age to Andy Gill's slashes and modernize Jon King's animadversions with cellphone photos, comparison with the 20-year-old Mall quickly reveals how blessed the mainstays are in drummer Mark Heaney, who in the great tradition of Marky Ramone has both the musical sense to respect Hugo Burnham's simplicity and the historical savvy not to attempt an anachronistic replication. Since their consumerist analysis was never that deep and their self-doubt always had a self-aggrandizement to it, all these adjustments are welcome. In fact, my favorite song here is ""A Fruitfly in the Beehive,"" which begins a quiet patch the original band would never have sat still for. It's not the only time they speak of repentance, for what I don't know--not some endorsement, I hope. Inspirational Verse: ""Where are we headed for? For a distant shore?

A longtime agnostic in re Guru and Premier except as regards the former's ill-advised Roy Ayers-Donald Byrd trip, I'm grateful for this exemplary compilation. For anybody wondering what ""flow"" can mean, Guru's smooth, unshowy delivery, cool in its confident warmth and swift without ever burying words or betraying rush, is one ideal, and Premier's steady drums 'n' bass, just barely touched by anything that would pass for a hook, undergird his groove with discretion and power. My problem has always been the music's formalism--the way it encouraged adepts to bask in skillful sounds and rhymes that abjure commerce and tough-guyism. But reducing five albums to two CDs not only ups the pop density, as you'd expect, but achieves variety by jumbling chronology and mixing in B sides and soundtrack one-offs that weren't cut to any album's flow. It's a credit to the duo's constancy that the result plays like a single release. And despite his occasional bad-girl tales and images of sexual submission, Guru's quiet rectitude and disdain for a street rhetoric whose reality he's seen make him a chronicler everybody can learn from.

Bootsy's cousins and Leon Russell's proteges, the three brothers Wilson were as bland as the two Brothers Johnson until an accidental 1980 P-Funk rip we'll call ""Oops Upside Your Head"" transformed them into a great funk band for a handful of silly singles. No champs at hands-on bass and drums, they power-tooled a futuristic electrofunk out of keyboards, sound effects, and overdubbed trackmastery--think ""Burn Rubber,"" ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me""--well before Bowie's ""Let's Dance"" or Clinton's ""Last Dance."" I miss ""Beep a Freak,"" which used a beeper as a rhythm instrument (eep!), and the payday throwaway they wrote for Keenan Ivory Wayans one night. But mainly I wish they'd escaped the African American superstition that ballads are old-age insurance. Two too many show up here--which is seven or eight fewer than on the new Ultimate Collection, which to squeeze them in eviscerates the classics down to radio length.

If Diana Ross wants to go disco, here's how--wholeheartedly, a good way to go anywhere. Mixing Diana's knowingly sexy little-girl soprano with a touch of Shirley Goodman party novelty, Gardner shrills and coos and cools through a total of five cuts on this two-disco disc album, and even the slow dances are worthy of use. ""Work That Body"" works that idea. ""When You Touch Me"" is what it's working toward, and ""Paradise Express"" is recommended to Merle Haggard, who's always ready to learn something new (and funky) about trains.

Anyone who can trace the genealogy of a ""Rock &amp; Roller"" ""from Bessie to Billie to B.B. to Boz""--that would appear to mean Boz Scaggs, folks--obviously has eccentric ideas about rock and roll. This turns out to be a virtue. Moving Joy of Cooking's folk-jazz fusion much closer to jazz, Garthwaite emerges as a kind of white, upbeat Esther Phillips, applying a gritty Dinah Washington cast to post-rock lyrics both metaphorical and incantatory. But she's more flexible, happier--her delight in pure sound suggests both scat improvisation and novelty nonsense--and if the long-windedness of the cuts here must be blamed on a singer who's worked too long outside the studio, we can credit their occasional stiffness to producer David Robinson, who deserves to be trapped in an elevator with the Tower of Power.

This wonderfully improbable record may signal a new movement--here comes the Copenhagen Sound. Would it were true. The LP compiles the best material from three Danish albums--which means not only released in Denmark but sung in the native language of that funky land, with translations provided in part by an Epic PR man who deserves a new job. Gasolin's music miraculously overwhelms the musicianship and symphonic textures of Yurrupean technopomp with the raucous good humor of genuine rock and roll, and their epithet for the U.S.--""the redskin land,"" they call it--should make any American chauvinist swell with irony. Just when you're afraid they're indulging in a little Guess Who-style sexism, ""It's all the same to an American dame,"" you figure out that what they're really saying is, ""It's all the same to an American Dane.""

There's barely a wasted track on a major-label bid that has more hooks than a Temptations best-of and more moods than a four-year-old at Disneyland. Do I like everything he says, much less puts on Instagram? Not close. But his saga is an encouraging, fascinating, educational up. This is a guy who always brings his daughter on tour and thinks affluence is a big day at Bloomingdale's. He's emotional, tender, violent, sensual, fickle, determined, fatalistic, unpredictable, unreliable, hedonistic, and from Louisiana. In a land of 10,000 wannabes, he's an original.

The gritty recovering alcoholic wrote these 11 grave, felt, angry, deliberate songs with service members, veterans, and spouses via a Nashville project called SongwritingWith:Soldiers. But examine the list of collaborators and see why it had better be ""members,"" not ""men""--five of the eight soldiers and all of the spouses are women, so that women alone write seven tracks. There's ""Brothers"": ""I was just like you when the bullets flew / I had your back you had mine too / Brothers in arms your sisters covered you / Don't that make us your brothers too?"" There's also ""Iraq,"" in which a mechanic with grease under her nails finds herself compelled to fend off male soldiers who are supposed to be on her side. On the other hand, one of the men writes ""It's Her Love"" for his wife: ""When I'm broken and I push her away / She fights her way back she's with me to stay."" But mostly what's stressed is respect for common service--documenting battle's brutal grind, celebrating the survivals it's been all of the cowriters' lifework to fight for one way or another, citing the many kinds of injury the combatants came home with, remembering their dead as guardian angels. Without moralizing more than a crack, all of these writers honor shared struggle without papering over how hard that can be: ""They say no man's left behind but that ain't true / They hate it that they need us but they do."" The record flinches sometime--wouldn't you? But it refuses to break.

And though the words are confused, at least they're sincere, which in an age of irony has its advantages. Just like on your record, not one cut announces itself, but that's only because these days Gaye aspires to a line (by which I mean a con or a come-on as well as a musical schema) more sinuous and insinuating than the peculiar hooks and JB elementals of yore.

The result is a groove album Motown wouldn't have risked back in 1965, by which time seven of these twelve tracks had been laid down, though not so sparklingly engineered. As much a showcase for the Funk Brothers band as for the jazz-tinged pop-gospel phrasing of the label's pet matinee idol, it's a chance to hear Motown's music unalloyed, without the distraction of sweet memory.

Last one was the great Ghostface album, which Wu fans didn't notice because they were up to their necks in mystical shit. Now that obscurantism is out of style again, his vocal clarity, verbal dexterity, and narrative facility push the collective pleasure button. They earn it, too--""One"" is hookier and ""Deck's Beat"" funkier than anything on Ironman. Still, only ""Child's Play""--kiddie nostalgia whose corny shtick Ghostface defeats with details that could come from a notebook--approaches the documentary coherence of ""260,"" ""Camay,"" or ""All That I Got Is You."" In effect, it's another Wu mood record. But this time the mood is all vocal clarity, verbal dexterity, and narrative facility. Plus perhaps the long hard look RZA took at Wu Wear's profit profile.

With the Wu so cash-poor it's concocting best-ofs from two-album catalogs, Ghostface remains rooted enough to rhyme as both Dennis Coles the insecure project kid and Tony Starks the tough guy with an eye. His high wail intimating banshee and crybaby, he tells a pathetic tale of small-time violence, lets sex get to him, and launches song-and-dance routines that bespeak his deep commitment to show business. Limited partner Raekwon pulls no more weight than the up-and-coming second-raters who provide alternative raps because this album is where Ghostface really steps up. Sure RZA's the man when he chips in, as in ""Walking Through the Darkness"" (ignore the booklet and go to track 11). But every beat belongs to the man with his name on the slug line, and that's all most of them need.

Not really rehashed leftovers but definitely a Christmas snack, this could prove a paradigm shift: major label--not Sanctuary meets De La or Koch doing its thing--sticks with quality artist past his commercial prime because he'll certainly break even and possibly sell long-term. Granted, it could just be Jay-Z playing his remaining executive cred for the greater glory of his artistic legacy (which would also be a paradigm shift). But hip-hop is now where rock was in the early '80s, when veterans such as Joni Mitchell, Randy Newman and Lou Reed were the equivalent of what the book trade called publishers' poets back when commercial publishers dealt poetry. Whether doing his ex-Wu thing or mixtaping with the Theodore Unit pals showcased here, Ghostface always tells a good story and finds a good beat. This isn't the gauntlet Fishscale was. It's just a good bunch of songs. Thank UniMoth for venturing capital on it.

By dint of hard work, Ghost now has him a minor career as the classiest crime story writer in a genre that supports plenty of them. His narratives aren't especially coherent or economical, but are they detailed. ""The way I fell cracked the face of my watch."" ""I know n****z with crack vials stuck to their colon."" Like that. Although he's all about the Benjamins that provide the design motif, I believe the stories are fictions. One tipoff is that right after ""White Linen Affair""'s priceless ""What an awards show, there's Kanye West/Pamela Anderson and she brought both of them breasts,"" he gets a piece of Alicia Keys--although I grant that the same song's ""Don't steal my ashtrays"" sounds pretty authentic.

Aware that maybe his true crime mode is getting tired, he makes the potentially ridiculous switch to love man. Anyone who's witnessed his ramshackle Delfonics shtick onstage is forgiven for forgetting the courtly ""Camay"" and the violently pornographic ""Wildflower"" from way back in 1995. But rhymewise, this is original work. Eschewing oily sexual details, luxury purchases, and vows of generalized devotion, Ghost mines the same kind of specifics that juice his gangsta repertoire. He doffs paisley pajamas, offers a pregnant honey sauteed shrimp, jots down his regrets while riding to Riker's, carries her groceries up when the elevator goes out. He likes women who read; he praises stretch-mark fat and thick legs; he amplifies his apologies by noting, ""I appreciate your concern and support for me."" Yes, he shoots the cuckolding cable guy and adds to ""Wildflower"" the YouPorn special ""Stapleton Sex."" And, yes, he does occasionally offer a prospect glimpses of hog heaven. But he really seems to like women, which in a love man you gotta love.

After a decade of secondhand longhairs pushing paisley and/or Manson and/or paganism and/or mulching and/or altered states as the true flowering of that storied '60s ideal, a postpunk comes up with a new improved aural simulation of hippiedom. It probably wasn't recorded on Howe Gelb's commune--sources indicate that Gelb doesn't have a commune. But what a commune it evokes--friendly, cooperative, never so spaced out it becomes dysfunctional. Guests drift in and out, and from Indiosa Patsy Jean, who sounds about five, to Pappy Dailey, who sounds about 70, there's room for anyone with a song. The first side makes something of the dissociated atmospherics that undermined the band's previous umpteen releases; the second's almost popwise. Together they're what country-rock was never really like, or wanted to be.

Well now, I've been hearing tales of Gibbons's plainspoken working-class wit for years, but that's the first time he ever zinged me good. And not the last. This postpub retrenchment is strewn with colloquial turns--the words knowing and compassionate, the instrumentation rock and roll understood as a mature language. Of course, the problem with colloquialism is that when inspiration flags even slightly it sounds ordinary, and that happens here, but on the whole this is an extraordinarily inventive step forward.

I'm not naive--I know importers love stupid haircuts and Japanese vinyl. But it still disturbs me that no one has worked this Brazilian item in the U.S. Already a dozen albums to the good, Gil converted me utterly at a recent Beacon concert with tunes I'd never heard before yet will know by heart when he brings them back, and most of these are the same way. Usually I play side one, the perfect upful morning groove, but when I turned it over to make sure I hadn't been kidding myself, old friends sashayed out of the speaker and shook my hand.

Milton Nascimento and Caetano Veloso are aesthetes like, to be kind, Joni Mitchell; Gil is a pop adept like Stevie Wonder, which I'd probably think was kind to Stevie if I understood Gil's lyrics. A warm-voiced natural melodist at home with Afro-American rhythms of every latitude, he's tried to break here with tours and Anglophone flops and reggae albums. Only Brazil fans have taken much notice--Nascimento and Veloso get much snazzier institutional support--and this effortlessly funky tour de force, the finest Gil album I know, probably won't do the trick either, but go for it. I find most Brazilian music genteel myself. Gil ain't, and this definitely ain't.

This isn't Gil's only self-titled album, at least not in Brazil, and thus has gathered confusing nomenclature--my Brazilian re-release says ""1968"" on the spine, while the 2008 edition on the San Francisco-based reissue label Water is subtitled ""Frevo Rasgado"" by Amazon and B&amp;N. But the cover's tropical take on Sgt. Pepper costumery never changes, and it's a tipoff. Aided by his young pals Os Mutantes, the 25-year-old harmonic sophisticate is charmed and inspired by the archly playful arrangements of pop psychedelica. But though it must have been hard to hear in the hippie years, Gil's post-sambas resemble show tunes more than they do ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" or ""See Emily Play."" He took the Beatles' abandonment of the straight groove as an excuse to emulate any kind of Anglo-American pop he wanted, with tropical rhythms for decoration. The tunes are so striking that I keep thinking I know the first few from tropicalia comps that actually favor others. The four bonus tracks drop off slightly if at all. And then there are the lyrics, available via cyber-translation that commits its quota of howlers and head-scratchers but also indicates that this Third Worlder saw the world more fully and clearly than his British exemplars and was probably a better poet too.

Cut in Joe Ely's basement, Gilmore's 1988 debut sank or swam with his rather pinched delivery, so if it contained anything as gorgeous as Gilmore-Hancock's ""See the Way"" and ""When the Nights Are Cold,"" there was no way to know it. Cut in Nashville, this one beefs up both voice and settings. The imagistic honky tonk of Gilmore's ""Dallas"" and Hancock's ""Red Chevrolet"" are why poets would-be like steel guitars.

This basically self-composed major-label whozis is solider than either, solid like the quality country album it ain't--Gilmore may not be writing so metaphysical any more, though ""Go To Sleep Alone"" is pretty deep, but he still sings like a space cadet.

Sometimes a backstory is more than a lead or a peg. Sometimes biographical tidbits situate a newcomer the way geopolitical scraps contextualize a style from a faraway land. So it is with Christopher Owens's history as a teenage escapee from a sexually abusive, culturally separatist cult. Delivered in Owens's throaty, childish wheedle, the tunes make themselves felt even before the grand, low-rent music starts evoking Spector and Brian Wilson sans budget or studio savvy. They suit the love laments too. And when you ask yourself what right this sad sack has to such retro escapism, the knowledge that he liberated himself into a world where '60s pop even existed legitimizes his yearning for innocence and may well be what put the ache in his voice, too. This renders his songs deeper and more moving. Now if only they didn't tail off vacantly at the end.

Usually good bands choose meaningful monikers like Stereolab or Sammy or Rage Against the Machine. But how about Husker Du? The Pixies? Nirvana? Read into those trademarks whatever you want in retrospect, you were drawn to them by the way the attendant guitars etc. did their things. So take the name for the cheap attention-getting device it is. The main difference here is an attraction altogether less instantaneous and surefire--to a sound that's impressive but cold, suggesting the Fall as produced by Al Jourgensen or In Utero at a more primitive level of spiritual development. Of course, once it reveals its human frailty, its pleasures seem deeper as a result. Ain't retrospect grand?

Released only somewhat clandestinely in the summer of 2006, the best mash-up album since 2002's The Best Bootlegs in the World Ever suggests why there've been so few competitors. Pittsburgh-based Gregg Gillis ups the ante. Like DJ Shadow or the Avalanches, only with obvious samples rather than obscure ones, he doesn't just make two songs smell like pirate booty--he reduces the been-there-done-that factor by creating new music from many of them. But by so doing, he embraces the novelty factor. Because his samples have their own inescapable identities, the songs never coalesce into something deeper, as with Shadow, or even cheesier, as with the Avalanches. Nor is there much compounding of groove--the effects are too sequential. So we have here an entertaining novelty album set on proving that filthy rappers are bloody good fun. This idea is more useful than asserting that pop froth is as deep as Nirvana. But it's not exactly a profound truth--not even always a liberating one.

The title song is about what it says it's about--""Counting the days till you're back,"" to be precise. But it also announces Glaspy's aesthetic strategy. Nominally she's a singer-songwriter, applying a voice labeled both lilting and gravelly but that I'd just peg as adult to songs that always make room for feelings we needn't assume are always hers. But she's even more striking as a guitarist, running a thick, rockish sound through a harmonic palette that suits both a Berklee dropout who audited master classes after she couldn't afford tuition and a Texan who got hip to passing chords playing backup fiddle with her musical family. Although her music is cleaner and clearer, she sounds like Speedy Ortiz's Sadie Dupuis if she sounds like anybody. But with Glaspy you have a clearer bead on whatever love the song is about--just not whether it's hers.

Rock ears take to this avant-garde composer because he understands electronic sound in a melodic context and loves rhythm, a rhythm achieved--like the hypnotic/mystical mood of the music as a whole--not through percussion but through mechanical repetitions cunningly modified. There is natural drama here, but Glass never indulges it, which is why he appeals to Eno's side of the ""progressive"" spectrum rather than to Keith Emerson's. What Eno fans may find hard to take--and what I find doubly admirable--is that this music refuses to fade into the background; it's rich, bright, and demanding despite its austerity. Onward.

When what the Brits call pop isn't popular, it's usually rock and roll chamber music if it's any good at all. This U.S. debut, a best-of that highlights the soulful ache in the vocals and the quirky opacities in the lyrics and does what it can for a modest tune sense, honors that suspect notion. It's not stylized, and not static either, but it's pretty subtle, and its half-finished edges and kinetic lyricism are best appreciated in tranquility if not repose.

The lyrics, which set oblique but never opaque romantic vicissitudes against a diffidently implied existential world-historic, aren't the secret of their lyricism, and why should they be? These Aussies make music, with Robert Forster's intensely sincere vocals and Grant McLennan's assertive but never pushy hooks pinning down the melodies. Granting all reservations about the form itself and with apologies to skillful romantics from R.E.M. to XTC, there are no popsters writing stronger personal love songs.

The title may portend the worst kind of major-label move, but their worst is pretty good. On the straightest and catchiest bunch of love songs they've ever produced, the likes of ""Quiet Heart"" and ""Love Is a Sign"" admittedly cry out for a little tension. But so does ""Streets of Your Town"" until you notice the battered wives and butcher knives. To put it simply: they ain't the Smithereens. They're smarter, they're nicer, they're tougher.

The quality of the B sides etc. on 1978-1990 surprised fans who thought they were buying greatest semihits, and like any world-historical pop band, the Go-Betweens were more than a song vehicle--they had a drummer.

But at 45 he never forgets what he found out early--that all transcendence is temporary because only mortal humans can transcend. He gets weary and admits it; he's messed up big time and admits that too; the songs come slower now. But he still feels the ""immigrant stamina"" of his chosen ""familia the undividable.""

Pop is such a plastic concept that to call this a pop comeback just confuses things--with its clean, bold, Martin Rushent sound and confident basic chopswomanship, it shares less with Beauty and the Beat than with, oh, Sports (and less than Bananarama does, too). In other words, it's an AOR move (with top-forty goals assumed). Lyrically, it represents a retreat--no place for sly subcultural anthems among these straightforward love songs (really relationship songs), which while sensible enough are never acute or visionary (or thematically consistent/complementary). And having peeled away several layers of resistance, I find the record thrilling. Its expressive enthusiasm gives me the same good feeling I used to get from their musical godmothers in Fanny--a sense of possibility that might touch women who are turned off by more explicit politics, and that these women are strong enough to put into practice.

Belonged on my singles list, I realized too late: after a here-and-gone intro that resembles the door-slam sound on an email program, one or two notes in three differently-voiced but similarly-paced 16-note plates advance over varied beats. If that sounds too simple, well, (a) it isn't and (b) that's the way great singles are sometimes (though you can skip the remix EP). After I got over my high I began to feel the rest of the album was a letdown, but far from it--just lesser variations on his trick of deploying short samples as beats without settling for staccato. Kind of like in rock and roll even if you'd never know it to listen to it--only to think about it.

Equally compelling are not one, not two, but three Kogan-penned love-songs-with-a-twist: ""Mikveh Bath,"" in which a virgin bride fantasizes about her husband-to-be as she purifies herself; ""Miskayt,"" in which a man and woman ""so ugly you could cry"" discover each other's good points; and ""Love You All the Time,"" in which a perpetually worried Kogan implores her husband not to run with scissors or go on Facebook.

Not to truck with the boogie bromide that spiritual uplift requires certified fun, but this album is anything but the pop retreat the conscious slot it as. Quiet as it's kept, message was always icing for these Dirty South pathfinders anyway, and this is the first time their music has ever achieved the infectious agape that's always been claimed for it. The mood recalls early go-go--a funk so all-embracing that anyone who listens should be caught up in its vital vibe.

Living in the valley of the shadow of chemo, Goodman believed in enjoying himself, and he also believed it was his job--meaning among other things the precondition of all the gratifications he refused to delay--to induce us to enjoy ourselves as well. That's one reason the live half of this double-CD is especially irresistible despite the old stuff. He's adroit, very funny, very tolerant, only rarely too warm, and incorrigibly middle-class.

Nah, I told her, though I liked them fine--too crude. And indeed, they're cruder than even the earliest Go-Betweens, who were a university band after all, and somewhat static at their worst. Usually, however, they're charming at least. When Louis fantasizes about a ""Boyfriend"" or James Harrison hates the ""Telephone,"" it just accentuates the specifically adolescent angst they pin down so much more candidly and affectingly than any other high school band that comes to mind.

But I doubt de facto frontman James Harrison was so cautious, and can imagine drummer Riley Jones learning that Lindy Morrison never stepped up to the mike and deciding she'd better: ""I don't want distance / When distance always seems to be the thing / That comes and hurts us."" In any case, a university art band they're not. Instead they're still reflecting on adolescence with a humility and concentration that hurts. No one's calling but they're not picking up the phone. Passing your bus stop hurts even though they know you need time to yourself. Come to think on it, they ""never knew what love meant"" anyway.

As far as he's concerned, that isn't humanity sitting up ""On Melancholy Hill""--it's a manatee, who got there by means only a cartoonist could grasp.

In a time when so many bands don't know why they exist but keep on vanning anyway, his honest tale is touching and instructive.

Their belated first album tries to be commercial, to touch a lot of bases with a broad demographic, but it's anything but formulaic. On the contrary, it's an act of self-expression--they do consider Rick James a hero--and thus experimental like albums used to be. The only instant killer is the opener, a borrowed funk showpiece featuring calisthenic bassist Doug Wimbish and three-handed drummer Keith LeBlanc. But in the end every experiment justifies itself, from the one Rahiem wrote for and performs like Stevie Wonder (he can actually sing, thus distinguishing himself from Kurtis Blow, Joseph Bowie, and the entire population of the United Kingdom) to the vocoder number to the idealistic Spinners-cum-Edwin-Starr impression to the one Rahiem wrote for God and performs like a believer.

The preserve of a huge, insular cult accustomed to rendering its very real aesthetic discriminations within a context so uncritical no outsider need pay them the slightest mind, the Dead's music has disappeared into the mythology it engendered. They were a great band--probably still are on the right night. But trying to convince an unbeliever is like trying to tell a stranger about LSD. Recorded in August 1968, when Pigpen McKernan was still living in his body, these nine songs include all six on the classic Live/Dead; playing is comparable, audio superior. Great drummers were hard to come by in the hippie era, and the Dead were too discursive to want one anyway--Bill and Mickey rocked out by revving tempo and volume and letting Pigpen take it away. But often the Dead's ruminations have content--they listened more responsively than any other band of the era.

But in its double-down on the chorus parts of old-fashioned verse-chorus-verse after verse-chorus-verse, it could almost be The E.N.D. As with the Black Eyed Peas, Gray's aesthetic strategy is a commercial strategy because she no longer thinks there's much difference. For those of us who've always loved her voice and shrugged off its thematic accoutrements, this is what the 2007 bellyflop Big meant to be; it's the Macy Gray album we didn't know we were dreaming of.

Gray was past 30 before she generated songs and persona suitable to a burred purr so striking she wasn't always so sure she liked it herself, evoking without equalling both Billie Holiday's timbre and Sarah Vaughan's size. The reason she got to take that voice pop is that plenty of us loved it. But some of us also thought she was forcing her portentous writing and wicked ways, and soon the pop market she was too mature for had had enough. Only then a funny thing happened--having given up on glory, she started making better records, none finer than this efficiently recorded jazz quartet showcase. Guitarist Russell Malone and trumpeter Wallace Roney earn their minutes, but mostly they make room for Macy as she eases into a few of her own standards and tops them with the new ""First Time.""

The popularity of his romantic disappointment, however, has induced him to narrow his persona. Item: The most impressive cut on the LP is ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?"" Green's version is far superior to the Bee Gees' original, but the original is pure glop. Item: The album doesn't include one piece of real funk. Green is still the most intelligent male soul singer to emerge in years, and in the context of three or four more albums this one may sound fine. Right now, it's much too much of a good thing.

FALSE,A-,I'm Still in Love With You,Al Green,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=59,"
Easily the most consistent soft-soul LP of the year, anchored in with an impressive collection of unforgettable background themes. I'm happy to own it. But I still remember that less than a year ago Green looked like he might turn into the Compleat Soul Man rather than Black Smoothie of the Year, and I make the following request: Remember Otis Redding. OK, Al?

FALSE,A-,Full of Fire,Al Green,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=65,"
Although the Buck Owens cover isn't up to the Willies and Krisses of yore and the hook riffs remain in slight decline, there are definitely more good songs here than on Al Green Is Love. They repay textual analysis, too. Last time the mind-boggler had Green improvising nonsense verse at robbers and other interlopers; this time he assumes the persona of God the Son (""I can see you but you can't see me"") and makes you love it. After all, visionaries are supposed to be far out, and this is one of the few we've got.

FALSE,A-,Al Green's Greatest Hits Volume II,Al Green,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=67,"
I welcome this proof of the greatness of Green's lesser and later hits, but I'd prefer a more eccentric (hence accurate) and equally impressive selection--one that replaced the two non-singles from I'm Still in Love With You (a lengthened ""Love and Happiness"" and ""For the Good Times,"" live staples that typify his pop mode) with, for instance, ""There's No Way,"" ""That's the Way It Is,"" and ""Love Ritual.""
"
FALSE,A-,I'll Rise Again,Al Green,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=72,"
This isn't great Al--it doesn't come through with the spiritual charge of a Call Me (secular) or Higher Plane (religious). But it is good Al, and after much soul-searching I've stopped worrying about what kind of gospel music it might be. If Green wants to attribute his positivity to romantic bliss, either, though I did find it easier to suspend disbelief. And while Christ and Eros are both more rewarding objects of faith than music, my guess is that at this point music is Al's bottom line--his very personal road to religious and secular glory glory.

FALSE,A-,Soul Survivor,Al Green,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=74,"
His boyish delicacy and mellow insouciance have roughened slightly with the years, but he can still muster that high moan, and here he bids to connect with unbelievers once again. The key's the covers, and those who consider ""He Ain't Heavy"" bad company for ""You've Got a Friend"" and vice versa should pause to recall ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"": just as the shameless yet muted poignancy of that homage dramatized the poignancy of Al's crossover dreams, the low-down show of agape he makes of these two universalist-humanist war-horses transports his Jesus fixation into the realm of schlock, where it fits in real nice.
"
FALSE,A-,Love Ritual: Rare and Previously Unreleased 1968-1976,Al Green,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=76,"
Cut one wild night in early 1975, the polyrhythmic title track was hot enough to lead Al Green Is Love and lend its name to a misbegotten 1978 compilation before Colin Escott ever dreamed of remixing it, but that's not to say it isn't even wilder with strings censored and voice and percussion up front. Livin' for You's ""So Good To Be Here"" also thrives, and the rest is as advertised--singles and outtakes originally deemed too eccentric for general consumption, many of them unadorned uptempo jams with the eternal Hi Rhythm Section. Willie Mitchell was no fool--""Strong as Death (Sweet as Love)"" and ""I Want To Hold Your Hand,"" which were released, top ""Mimi"" and ""Ride Sally Ride,"" which weren't. But Escott is no fool either, and in retrospect these songs of mysterious origin cohere into a phonogram as desirable as Greatest Hits Volume II.

FALSE,A-,Don't Look Back,Al Green,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=78,"
This hard-to-find, slightly long-winded return to Mammon isn't what it should be, might be, or in theory will be, once MCA finalizes a promised revamp with its Hall of Fame inductee (hey guys, there's an angle--and there it goes, receding into the distance). Since eight of 13 titles feature the word ""love"" (OK, once it's ""lovin',"" and in parentheses), the pruning will presumably start somewhere in there, although as with so much great minor Green not one of those performances lacks vocal frisson. Executive mastermind Arthur Baker finds a use for Curtis Stigers on the title tune and cedes Al a nice Charles &amp; Eddie song, but the primary hands-on guys are Fine Young Cannibals David Steele and Andy Cox. On their ""One Love,"" which strikes my impractical ear as the sure shot MCA craves, Green negotiates a thoroughly modern electrobeat so effortlessly you gotta believe he can live the rest of his life without God or Hi Rhythm.

FALSE,A-,I Can't Stop,Al Green,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12159,"
His midrange less creamy, he shouts a lot and relies on falsetto to make a point. Although Smokey Robinson and Seth Swirsky songs perked up his last pop move, he takes composer's credit for every shining star and pledge of love, generally leaving a share for his new old pal Willie Mitchell, who for his part proves all too willing to put subtlety behind him and get bumptious with the horns. So don't believe kneejerks crying comeback. But don't believe regular jerks whining hype either. Material has never been a big deal for a singer whose arrangements always play second fiddle to his inventions, and that singer has retained plenty of voice and the guile to know what to do with it. Give these performances time and they cohere, not as classy modernizations or returns to a form he never lost, but as artistic statements from someone with no history of taking his talent for granted. New classic: ""My Problem Is You,"" all 6:28 of it.
"
FALSE,A-,Lay It Down,Al Green,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14050,"
Between producer ?uestlove's command of tradition, including cannier drums than Green has had since Al Jackson Jr. was taken from us, and the 62-year-old singer's skillfully tended chops, this sounded fine straight off. But the formula seemed slightly pat, and I didn't hear a ""Call Me,"" much less a ""Love and Happiness."" So I put it away, came back, immersed, and noticed two things. 1) The first four or five tracks work as songs, the instant minor classic the one that clarifies a basic principle: ""Your love is just for me/It's just for me/It's just for me, for me, for me/It's just for me."" 2) No Jesus, which some count a failing, but not secular me. Except for the finale--""Write this down if you can/I'm a cold, hard-working man,"" so I did--here is that rare thing, a credible album entirely devoted to connubial bliss. True, Green spends more time supplicating than celebrating, and probably fabricated the whole scenario. But he knows his subject, and he doesn't need Jesus to lay it down.

FALSE,A-,I Want to Grow Up,Colleen Green,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16699,"
Sad girls have never been my thing--better post-sad, all angry and sarcastic and breaking on through. But in the wake of 2013's slow, hung-up Sock It to Me, I like the way this clinical depressive assumes agency by asking the musical question, ""Why do I feel so sorry for myself?"" Recovering or regressing, she's so direct, so candid, so saturated with therapeutic truisms whose truth value only a guy she's better off without would deny. And as a consequence her self-examination is captivating. The music plods steadily forward, her quiet, thoughtful, girlish soprano beefed up by her loud, straightforward, unvirtuosic guitar and solid two-piece backup. The tunes are singsong things suitable to confessions like ""Because I'm sick of being immature / I wanna be responsible / And I'm sick of being insecure / I wanna be more comfortable."" The one stunner is the six-minute ""Deeper Than Love,"" which begins: ""Someday I hope for a lover to kill me / It's the closest I can hope to get to anybody."" But from ""TV is my friend"" to ""I can't stop grinding my teeth,"" there's plenty nondepressives should know here, and the music delivers it.

FALSE,A-,They Like Me Around Here,David Greenberger/Paul Cebar Tomorrow Sound,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15938,"
I do wonder how reliably I can judge these records, in which Greenberger transforms serious seniors' generally touching, often loopy, and sometimes inspirational musings and recollections into dramatic readings with musical accompaniment. They're pretty numerous by now--I sure haven't heard them all--and risk getting repetitive too. Nevertheless, they do vary, in part because Greenberger shuffles arrangers. Yet though this is billed as a ""follow-up"" to the 2009 Cebar collaboration Cherry Picking Apple Blossom Time, it's very different structurally. There 34 of 38 tracks run under 2:13, where here only three of 19 do, and just because these have more heft, fewer of them skew toward pathos or damage. The steady good humor of the voice the 58-year-old Greenberger has developed to enact his interviewees always imparts dignity, smoothing over hesitations and infirmities. But here the words have extra force, with Cebar's instrumentation fuller too. The proud ""She Voted,"" the prouder ""Thank You, Reuben,"" the skydiving ""The Thrill,"" and the title track ""Nemo and Harmony"" all inspire mightily. For pathos, try ""Telephone"": ""I don't have anyone to call.""

David Greenberger and his Duplex Planet project are old news, and there've been other recordings. But I'm not sure how many a music person would want, and can't imagine any of them improving on the new one I've fallen for: 17 subtly intonated dramatizations of words Americans in elder facilities have spoken to Greenberger followed by a multivocal 19-minute finale. No one's altogether bitter, but many are weary, and gradually the selections become not so much sadder as deeper, their bygone vernacular a bearer of authority and idiosyncrasy, reason and regret. Wise, deluded, confused, loving, placid, wacky, they reminisce and philosophize as they wait for the end, and Greenberger respects them all. Mark Greenberg provides each reflection with dedicated homespun accompaniment--bass and/or drums and/or keyboard, ukulele and/or accordion and/or vibraphone--that accents the musicality of their speech. The words would appear to be all. Yet every time your mind wanders, your ear tells you they're not.

For accuracy's sake, I should note that you haven't exactly heard it all before--the drums are punchier, the structures trickier. But insofar as you have, that's the point: punk lives, and these guys have the toons and sass to prove it to those who can live without. Before they start to wear down, they've done their bit for apathy, insanity, voluntary poverty, and the un-American way.

""I'm a smart-ass but I'm playing dumb"": eight million sold and all he admits to knowing is the futility of Telegraph Avenue losers who dis the rich occasionally and each other all the time.

What's going on with Billie Joe is less maturity than the really boring stuff--professionalism, craft, artistic growth. He's abandoning the first person. He's assuming fictional personas. And he's creating for himself the voice of a thinking left-liberal who ""want[s] to be the minority"" and cautions against caution itself--a voice that scolds rather than whines, a nice age-appropriate shift. Crucially, his knack for simple punk tunes remains unchanged; also crucially, these do fine at moderate tempos, and one even gives off a whiff of Brecht-Weill. There are worse ways to come down off a multiplatinum high--lots of them.

Don't anticipate virtuosity as mortals such as you and I conceive it. Performed primarily by members of Doueh's family, with women providing much of the percussion if the photos I've seen are any guide, this music is rough and crude the way garage revivalists, for instance, only wish they could be, because in their own way these people can play, and it isn't your way. It helps that the recording quality improves vastly on his previous home-taped standards. But it also helps that somebody convinced him he was free to let loose.

Unbeknownst to anyone but their record company, the Guess Who staged a mild comeback in 1974 and 1975--their next-to-last official LP, Flavours, charted higher than anything they'd released since 1971. What this meant was that they'd gone top ten on the AM again, with the inspired ""Clap for the Wolfman""--Burton Cummings quickly mastered the music-life song once somebody else thought of it. The second side of this ultimate compilation showcases their late period, which means a decrease in misogyny (and the elimination of such dubious hits as ""Share the Land"" and ""Bus Rider"") from Best of. Tuneful, hard-driving commercial rock and roll with some lilts for variety. What more do you want?

When you wrap one good-but-not-great album a year around a voice so frail and a sensibility so quirky, you're liable to find yourself pigeonholed--as a miniaturist, an odd duck if not a small fry. On the other hand, if just a few of those LPs are a little better than anyone has a right to expect, people might start thinking you're an auteur or something. I don't go for that frog talk myself, but this release has me pulling out my old Arlo albums and discovering how ideally the limitations of his voice have always suited his wry and complex understanding of things. Especially recommended: ""Guabi Guabi,"" an absurdly cheerful African ditty that ought to be a novelty hit, and ""Victor Jara,"" the most painful protest song in recent memory (including ""Hurricane"").

Protest music with a vengeance--originally conceived as a six-song project by Guthrie in 1946, expanded by Moses Asch to mark the Bicentennial, and now reissued by the federal government for the good-politics people at Rounder. The title may be a progressive shibboleth, but there's nothing especially uplifting about these tales of class warfare, most of which detail grisly defeats. Guthrie's heroes are smothered or incinerated in mine disasters, massacred by company thugs, hunted down by bloodhounds, left to rot from nonslip hangknots. A few times they get to kill back, but if they're really lucky they're buried in union coffins--""Every new grave brings a thousand members."" In short, morbid shit, its tradition the Appalachian ballad and Emily Dickinson rather than the deracinated spirituals and pink-cheeked camp songs of good clean American leftism. Can thrash covers be far behind?

He often sounds like he's winging it. But where Bobby Brown and Al B. Sure! play the love man falsetto straight, Hall adds depth by straying toward the manly emotionalism of the church.

Dragged bitching and moaning down to Fat Possum, Mississippi, to sing a sheaf of nonhits written by rubes in overalls he'd never heard of, the great totem of Chicago blues gets large on the pop process in which a producer induces an artist with more talent than concept to make a good album. That Dennis Herring boasts among his credits Counting Crows and Jars of Clay only proves George Martin's Law: You can lead a horse with no name to the mic, but you can't hum a few bars of ""Love Me Do"" and expect him to sing it for you. And since this producer also collects antique amplifiers, not only did he introduce his new property to the untapped songbook of Junior Kimbrough et al., he hooked the property's snazzy guitar to machines so raunchy they make his old Chess stuff sound like Motown. Adding a showman's drama to the kind of material that normally requires a porch or roadhouse, he created a landmark of neoprimitivism.

Voicing the great Spanish and Latin American revolutionary themes that Carla Bley has arranged for a norteamericano liberation orchestra, this testifies to the inestimable beauty and value of cultural autonomy, and by extension cultural cross-fertilization. It's assured but never immodest, elegiac but never maudlin, and Haden's two originals partake of the spirit. Bley's seem inconsequential, though, and the freestyle improvisations (kept in check until side two) generate little pleasure or meaning--except unintended questions about the ultimate relevance of late-capitalist avant-gardism to anti-imperialist struggle, not to mention disparate meanings of freedom in vastly disparate economic situations.

It closes with ""I'm a White Boy,"" about a Bad Redneck, a race-conscious guy who's too proud for welfare but would settle for a rich woman and/or an easy job. These are powerful pieces whether you like them or not, rendered with passionate sympathy and a touch of distance--his strongest in years. The ""filler"" includes covers from old standbys Williams and Wills and new favorites Delmore and Wells and an envoi to Lefty Frizzell as well as a gospel song and a running song and a sentimental standard that works (for once).

He screws in the afternoon, he takes his wife to Florida for a weekend of woo he's sure will patch things up, he settles for a substitute: ""I don't have to wonder who she's had/No, it's not love, but it's not bad."" You wonder exactly which working men these songs are for--makes you realize how many high-rolling automobile dealers he plays to. But self-pity has rarely possessed a more observant spokesperson. And ""Rainbow Stew"" says bye with an antiutopian whimsy lefties can relate to.

FALSE,A-,If I Could Only Fly,Merle Haggard,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2356,"
For decades aesthetes have crowed about the hard-traveling Haggard's all-American musicality without mentioning that he's a cranky bastard who never decides till the moment at hand whether this gig or session is worthy of his high standards. After a long, dispiriting string of releases that gradually devolved from hit-or-miss to cynical, he comes out of nowhere on a punk label to cut one of the very best albums of his very uneven recording career. Although I doubt there's a ""Mama Tried"" or ""Today I Started Loving You Again"" here, I'm positive there's no ""Valentine"" or ""Kids Get Lonesome Too,"" both of which turned my stomach at a 1996 show, and I like or love most of the new songs-including the metanostalgic ""Wishing All These Old Things Were New,"" the Western swing condom commercial ""Bareback,"" and several about how much he loves his fifth wife. Plus sui generis singing that pauses for consecutive Bing Crosby and Johnny Cash tributes, and the sense of time that permeates his equally sui generis Bakersfield swing. What is his deepest belief? That time is to be savored, not possessed.

Now 74 and short half a lung, he's not making the best music of his life, just the best albums. The playing keeps getting savvier, he hasn't lost as much voice as God intended, his homegrown anarchism is feistier than ever, and with help from his fifth wife he's still writing keepers. Not even the anti-Nashville ""Too Much Boogie Woogie"" feels like filler. Try a title track that crests with ""Well the water came in, the water went out/Saw the Hall of Fame floatin' about,"" or the equally insouciant ""Laugh It Off,"" or the love songs for seniors ""Down on the Houseboat"" (they've got money) and ""Under the Bridge"" (they don't), or a ""What I Hate"" where he blames the resurgent Civil War on the Rebels. Or if all that sounds too darn modern, start with the three oldies: ""Cocaine Blues"" on his lonesome, ""Jackson"" with his fifth wife, and ""Working Man Blues"" with Shotgun Willie and his own 17-year-old son. Man's learned how to live, and he has no intention of stopping.

The Egyptian sha'bi style reigned over by this good-looking country lad cum college grad remains sufficiently exotic stateside to resist piddling distinctions, but one thing can surely be said about his 95-minute virtual best-of: It never stops. The Cairo horns that sound so stately in most Middle Eastern pop are riotous, and while I couldn't tell you which percussion interlude goes where without consulting a scorecard, any one can get you going. What it evokes for me is a classic James Brown show with fewer rest stops and a less brilliantly elaborated bottom-the kind of high-energy ritual fools think primitive but we know as a specialty of urban society in the electric age.

Born into a family of Gnawa musicians in Marrakech in 1963, Hakmoun wasn't yet 25 when he settled Stateside, where his adaptable three-string sintir soon made him bassy North African aide-de-camp to Don Cherry and thence Peter Gabriel. Through Gabriel, he released several showbizzy mid-'90s CDs, but on his first album since 2002, the resounding steady-state propulsion of the opening ""Zidokan"" soon had me wondering whether I'd judged too quickly. Over 12 longish tracks, Hakmoun beefs up his trad axes and hoarse humanitarian imprecations with plenty of ""rock"" guitar, trap drums, percussion add-ons, and electronics, and for 70 minutes his fusion never stops moving long enough for your schlock anxiety kick in. Nor does the fact that ""Zidokan"" is slower than most diminish its propulsion a thrum.

As the postpunk Modern Lovers gain musicianship (accrue musicians?), they're beginning to sound vaguely like Beefheart, and these days I prefer them--better nerd primitives-turning-primitivists than hippie primitivists-turning-pretenders. Any of their thousand faithful who fear this latest album represents some accommodation with commerce shouldn't have nightmares about Unconditionally Guaranteed--it's more along the lines of Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller). Meanwhile, their target market, which must number at least ten thousand, can sing along to nearly everything here and recollect most of it in moments of unwonted tranquility. I love all the songs about Jad Fair's pathetically normal sexual obsessions, but my favorites are his nerd ""Secret Sharer"" (""There's a man who looks like me/And talks like me/And acts like me/But that's where the similarities end"") and his nerd ""Ball and Chain"" (""It's not fair!"").

It might be possible to array all their best-realized inspirations in neat rows and convert the fogies who've never given the brothers Fair a first hearing or a second thought. But if they themselves were capable of such compromises, there'd be no point. So here are two sprawling CDs somewhat more consistent than the messes that are their albums--69 not quite randomly ordered tracks (and don't think they can't add), at least 45 or 50 of which you'll be happier for knowing, with annotations that include David's guitar lesson (""I like to put six different sized strings on because that gives the most variety, but my brother used to put six strings of the same thickness on so he wouldn't have so much to worry about"") and the news that Loud, which was released in 1981, was recorded in 1982. Theorem: Jad, who likes girls, is more winsome (and talented) than David, who fears them. Corollaries: their romances top their sci-fi, and despite their renowned noise, their greatest moments are slow ones about crushes, usually sweetened by competent sidemen. The imperfect introduction.

FALSE,A-,Adequate Desire,Michael Hall,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2363,"
Far be it from me to attribute his edge to the journalism on his boho resume, but he's always been a cut or two above the dozens or hundreds of marginal or semiprofessional singing songwriters who can pull your coat for a cut (or two). In fact, he's got a best-of's worth of tunes behind him: for starters, ""Sharlene,"" ""Debi Came Back,"" ""I Work Hard,"" ""I'm Sorry, I Can't Rock You All Night Long,"" ""Don't Love Me Wisely,"" ""Let's Take Some Drugs and Drive Around."" But this is the first time he's opened the door to music lovers unequipped with the aesthetic discipline or psychological serendipity cut-above music usually requires. Since cut-above artists evolve just like the ones you keep your ear on, it catches him at an unrepresentative moment--he hasn't always been so reflective, although at this late date he may be stuck with it. He's not just trying to pin the moment when love reveals its mystery--he's trying to make it last as he looks death in the eye.

One reason Merle Haggard's thought of as the Poet of the Common Man is that he's also in the running for Voice of the Common Man; even with Jerry Kennedy's genius assembly line behind him, Hall's monotone isn't liable to shiver your short hairs unless he gets the words just right. Here he comes close. He honors Ravishing Ruby and remembers his own younger brother, hitching into town for medicine and coffee in the bad winter of 1949. He gets stuck in a motel in Spokane and comes back to Olive Hill with all his faults intact. And he yokes his best political song, about the man who hated freckles and Martin Luther Queen, with one of his worst slow ones, designed for those who find ""candy in the windows of my mind"" a poignant trope.

Logocentric cuss that I am, I'm not ""on"" Instagram, but recommend Googling her Buzzfeed-curated Instagram top 25.

Though the man aka Hamell on Trial wields a loud acoustic guitar, this document of his award-winning 2007 performance at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe is basically a comedy record. Sinking old, new, and previously unrecorded songs into monologues about pizza-faced pizza bosses and his kid's chance of getting hit by a car, he harangues, jokes around, and rocks out about ""the terrorism of everyday life""--a theme epitomized for Hamell by the recent finding that oral sex increases the practitioner's susceptibility to cancer by 250 percent. He rarely bothers scoring political points because he figures his audience doesn't need them. Instead he expands on power's existential ramifications. The concert lasts 63 minutes; a truncated version pumped with sharp interviews and low-budget visual interpolations occupies a one-hour DVD. Comedy records wear out, and unless friends come over, you may not play this one much even if you love it the first time. But if my description makes you think you might love it, you will.

The album rocks frantically even though there are drums on only two tracks. It includes five songs about the lowlifes he knows so intimately, including the title manifesto and the feminist ""Jennifer's Strippin' Again."" ""Gods at Odds"" is feminist, too--matrideistic, even. ""Mom's Hot"" features his son Detroit and lusts after women or a woman missing a total of one leg and one breast.

Where's-the-melody is beside the point, because even when they're just hooks the melodies seem a little obvious, without the physical or intellectual bite of the rhythm tracks (nowhere mightier than on the amazing ""Metal Beat,"" recommended to those who think Trevor Horn is into something heavy). And me, I doubt Herbie should be playing more ""jazz""--several of the false moments here are provided by Saint Wayne Shorter himself. The African exotica of Foday Musa Suso and Aiyb Dieng, on the other hand, sounds right at home. As does the South Bronx exotica of D.St.

Of course Brett's no Acuff or Haggard; his static baritone barely negotiates the notes. But as the quietly elaborate direct-to-Mac arrangements swell unassumingly beneath haunting verses and the occasional killer refrain, Rennie's conceits hit home.

At a moment when any depressive with a good line of patter is positioned to convince disaster-dazed dissidents he's the prophet Jeremiah, lyricist Rennie Sparks and her doleful husband and music provider Bret deliver a new sheaf of morbid songs. These feel right even when their melodies dim out, in part because they aspire to mood rather than prophecy. More than half concern or mention animals, usually but not always still alive. One significant exception is a billion passenger pigeons, another the dog, cat, gerbils, goldfish, rabbit, chipmunk, squirrel, and insects to whom she/he bids so long. Right, the pets are supposed to be funny, in a morbid way. None of the humans who populate this album are so lucky. A few of them are deaf or blind, though.

Until now the most efficient way to acquire a taste for Rennie and Brett's weird tales was the Ireland-only Down in the Valley comp. This night of greatest whatevers is longer, cheaper, and better. Since they make what little music there is themselves, they've got no production values to lose. Brett's deep monotone loosens up live. And the onstage bickering about magic crystals of overpriced kitty litter and the correct pronunciation of ""Vienna sausage"" normalize their obsession with the grotesque, the doleful, and the other side of eternity's divide. Sounds like they drive around America picking up gossip at roadside attractions, filling stations, ice cream socials, and bars serving 3.2 beer. Does ""Here in the bipolar ward/If you shower you get a gold star"" reflect personal experience? So I'm led to understand. But if they weren't past that experience, Rennie wouldn't write about it so well, and Brett wouldn't sing about it at all.

Who can resist a recollection that begins, ""I can see you standing there in your grass-stained underwear,"" or deny her twin visions of existential displacement in airports? But when you have to struggle to realize that ""Our Blue Sky"" is a global-warming warning that belongs on television, is the problem really the writing, or eternally impassive Brett Sparks feeling more depressed than usual? My theory is that when his wife hits one good, his voice gets lifted.

Since each of the 12 songs is named after an animal--including just one mammal, and a wildebeest at that--you expect a zoological concept album. In fact, however, the title creatures all have walk-ons, fly-ons, swim-ons, or crawl-ons, even the conquering flies who think General Custer looks so ""beautiful"" dead. Yet the only true ringer is a magic lizard whose bite requires a witchcraft cure--in all the rest, the animals are intimates of a natural world humans navigate clumsily and uncomprehendingly except in ""Frogs,"" where the housebound are bidden to tromp down through the mud and hear their amphibian song. As always, the tales are Rennie Sparks's, the teller her dour husband Brett, and the tales themselves are why you first listen. But these are so fine you don't mind listening again. And as you do, you start noticing how deftly Brett negotiates lines and stanzas that aren't as blockish as their meter and his voice make you think. And then you listen to this uningratiating music some more.

Especially after I read the enlightening if microscopic 3000-word essay concealed in the CD case, this live album finally convinced me that Todd Snider was worthy of his own rock dream--a dream the essay claims or reports took this form after the fearless leader was roused from one of his many scary stupors to discover that he was no longer Blind Lemon Pledge. Launched by Bo Diddley and finished off by Chuck Berry with Elvis shining ""Burn Out Shoes"" in between, he leads a jam band worthy of a song called ""Ascending Into Madness"" and then ascends from madness himself. The middle third drags, especially when his drawl deteriorates into an incomprehensibility no guitar ace can right. But even there he gets points for remaining the only rocker of any stripe to call out the LIBOR rate by name. Addressing ""my fellow hippies,"" he observes: ""This night might be the night of our entire lives. Why not? Why not? Why not tonight?"" And though it's obviously possible he says that every show, it's to his credit that he seems too unhinged to be so calculating. Far more than any jam band record I've gotten through, this is the rock dream the hippies invented before they burned out. Snider has come way too close to burning out himself. But so far he hasn't.

If it doesn't flow like Williams or Bragg &amp; Wilco, well, there's nothing gracious or integrated about Hart's claim, which is that when you start with country blues all of American pop is your territory.

But I admired her ease, her naturalness-within-formality, and more and more that's how it is with Harvey. In a charcoal suit and stacked heels plus red top, this was a concert artist repaying the adoration of her fans, but not so as she'd give them the early songs they wanted. Instead she concentrated on less immediate new material, which gained power in performance just as it does with repeated exposure on record.

In the wake of three questionable albums, shtick is a relief, not just because it's really great shtick but because after all these years we're happy to be clear about whether she's performing or expressing herself. Playing a spooky game of hide-and-seek or stealing the soul of a mother in mourning or kissing off a California where she you can bet never bought sunscreen or brutalizing a mama's boy with a chicken liver spleen, she's nothing less than the Queen of Goth, eternally uncrowned because some shtick she's just too good for.

Now pursuing an active musical career from Catalonia, this ex-nurse from the Western Saharan possesses the most remarkable vocal instrument to emerge from northern Africa--a searing contralto, serious yet excitable and often transported, that can cut into anyone's indifference. Born in 1958 like Rachid Taha, she's had it a lot harder--refugee camp, divorce, breast cancer, guitarist lost to leukemia. Nor does she project much of Taha's showbiz pragmatism--her calling is the Sahrawi style called haul, which on 2010's Shouka she and a new guitarist showcased in all its chorus-driven, prayerlike, insular intensity. By comparison, this one's forgiving enough to lift a tourist's spirits--there's some saxophone, and the melodies bid buenas dias. And then, two thirds of the way in, guitar and harmonica state a theme that may take a while to ID--holy moley, it's Betty Wrigh""Clean Up Woman,"" plus ululations and a friendly sax solo--and the rest of the album loosens up some more before climaxing with seven minutes of avant closer. Back in camp they may think that makes her a sinner. Folkies may grouse as folkies will. But I say she's trying to have some fun, and that she and we deserve it.

Guests range from the Sahara ululators who haunt ""Najter Alaila Anadal Lihuela"" to New York avant-bassist Shanir Blumenkranz contrapuntalizing the desert blues ""Latlal,"" from Yemeni-Israeli Ravid Kahalani to Sierra Leonean-Nigerian Seydu. I haven't figured out who's in the jazz combo that backs ""Illah Engulek Di Elkalma,"" but I love the way her easy mesh with the idiom segues abruptly into one where the sub-Saharan Seydu softens her dry wail only to be overtaken in turn by a searing Sahrawi haul. The ""Al Widaa"" finale was recorded five months before she passed on in her haim, a word than means both family and tent. If 82-year-old Leonard Cohen made his death album, then 58-year-old Mariem Hassan made hers--and it's less sere.

From Algeria-based Western Saharan exiles circa 2002, the most powerful single-artist desert disc I've heard. Hassan is a nurse and mother who obtained a divorce from her first husband because he wouldn't let her sing. Resolute, soul-struck, transported by struggle, she's the heart of guitarist Baba Salama's music, and while a male singer named Jalihena is very much present, women's voices dominate--not just Hassan, but her comrade Shueta and on several tracks whole keening choruses. A cooperative sonic gestalt more progressive genderwise than that of most Judeo-Christian bands that bring men and women together, it's also surer of itself--probably because everybody involved has something to fight for.

With the same drummer and keyb man on all seven cuts, this is the composer-trumpeter's strongest and harshest music to date. The trio is basically a rhythm band (keybs play ""facsimile bass, percussion, strings, etc.""); more than ever, Hassell is a colorist rather than a melodist (much less a soloist). If there's a problem it's that the music's ambient anonymity is compromised by its astringency. But us city folk are so steeped in the shit that we take pleasure in putting background dissonance under quiet control.

Always warm not chill, Hassell's quiet, environmental ""fourth world"" music has staying power that enlarges with time--listening back, I hear more complexity and groove in 2005's patched-together Maarifa Street than I did at the time. But ever since his fateful 1980 collaboration with Brian Eno, atmospheric gestalt rather than flesh-and-blood pulse has been his calling. Like Miles Davis in his lost-and-found '70s, Hassell has long raised keyboards to parity with a trumpet that never aspires to the clarity and speed of masters from Armstrong to Marsalis. At 81, he's explored that parity for half his life, seldom more calmingly than on this self-release. Ever the avant-gardist, he insists that his latest music has a synesthetic relationship to the paintings of his dear friend Mati Klarwein. But we don't have to go there. If you're merely seeking something to soothe and engage simultaneously, this will perform that anxiety-easing, life-enhancing, aesthetically self-sufficient trick even better than usual.

Hassell's untreated trumpet leads a multipedigreed avant-pop cusp band--from Praxis, Disposable Heroes, Tom Waits--through what most often sounds like that rare thing, good fusion. Miles and Eno, acid jazz, hip hop lessons, New Age world-music BS--all are here, with barely a hint of ripoff. The minimalist experimenter/dabbler's most conventional and convincing record.

Cut ten years ago by a street musician and jailbird who sings like Sam Cooke and strums acoustic guitar like Bob Dylan, these fourteen songs--especially the four backed by Philip Walker's humdrum blues band--wouldn't have seemed so remarkable had they been released back then, in the late soul era. But they are remarkable, because Hawkins is a true folkie hero, by which I mean that his lyrics are his own. These little dramas of passion, tenderness and betrayal are stamped with the sin-and-redemption of a lived life. And if the musical conception is excessively elementary, the singing is distinctive--derivative or not, the voice is expressive and earned.

The best punk revivalists understand that without catchy songs they might never have fallen for the style to begin with. Ditto the best honky tonk revivalists. Soul revivalists, not so much. So maybe Detroiter Andrew Cohen's civically revivalist Motown/Ford homage inspired him to hone a bunch of hooks and get an assembly line up and running. What we're hearing here is the Temptations turning into the Delfonics--the way his midrange gives up the verse and his falsetto takes the chorus is as nice as his boyish sexism. In the best song, he spills his coffee and misses his bus yet is lifted by a cellphone call where she says she loves him. In a good one Snoop Dogg sings.

The effect is '70s Miles with somewhat softer tastes in expanded consciousness, or Jon Hassell less hung up on repetition. If at times the syncretism seems slightly received, this often beautiful, often kicking record proves not just that rock can fuse with jazz and ""ethnic"" with ""Western,"" but that each fusion can then fuse with the other--as long as you keep your ear on the music and your eye off the demographics.

But the sound is brighter here, and the Heartbreakers' ""final shows"" at Max's are an institution that has earned the permanence of plastic.

The band is riot grrrl Lo Safai and her muso boyfriend Ben Pollock, who make or made their living renting out her crystal-covered ice cream truck to rich kids' birthday parties. The album is the debut they began promising in 2008, which materialized two years ago to the tune of a few distracted reviews as well as full lyrics on Genius. I downloaded a press copy I forgot until I tripped over it in iTunes, whereupon it went into heavy rotation: beaty synth-guitar-drums, hummable tunes, Safai's girlish-not-grrrlish soprano delivering lyrics about following your heart down the byways of love to the end of the world. Breathy with a sweetness even when she's putting the plosives on ""ping pong pussy,"" Safai sells the record like it's an organic lollipop. ""They give us hope then they take it away"" is about love and the world at the same time. ""KISS"" predicts ""Sooner or later I'm gonna get you/Sooner or later I'm gonna let you down"" so it can ""hope we get forever."" The birthday-ready ""Final Warning"" counsels: ""Hey little kids you better take a warning/There's this little thing called global warming."" Thirtysomethings may find the whole schmear too icky, 2008, or both. I'm charmed straight up.

I wish aesthetic or ethos allowed for clearer vocals--would like to hear Melanie's dreams before the deed was done, and wonder whether p.u.n.k. really stands for ""painful ways"" as well as ""utopia-""""new jeans""-""kid in her.""

But because she's also convinced that ""everything is fucked up,"" she's sure her rage is here to stay, something she and the world will have to deal with, thus obliging her to imbue it with intelligible form. Lyrics are crucial--her counterattacks on sexual predators are variously voiced and passionately felt, and ""Waitress Hell"" should raise tips all over Grrrlland. But the clincher is the noise she and her guitar make along with bassist-drummer Tracy Sawyer--controlled, fierce, a deliberate, powerful punk derivative that's built for discomfort, not for speed.

And although more far-out referents might arguably block my passway to his freewheeling freestyles, subcontinental beats like Keyboard Kid's electro-Carnatic ""Let It Go"" and Harry Fraud's serpent-charming ""Wild Water Kingdom"" mean to create a world of fun for everyone: ""When Heema rappin'/This is what happen/Everybody foot gets to tappin'/Everybody dance like they Latin/Everybody clothes turn to silk and to satin/Everybody metal turn from silver to platinum/Everybody set like director said action."" Climaxed by a love song to an r&amp;b also-ran whose first name rhymes with Tone-Loc's favorite love potion, this jumpy tribute to substance exploitation may be his gangsta album.

With Material's Fred Maher replacing Voidoid-turned-Ramone Marky Bell and engineer-bandleader Naux augmenting Robert Quine on guitar, this is no lowest-common-denominator job: it's fuller and jazzier than Blank Generation without any loss of concision. Or toon appeal--the dissonantly dissident fun includes the antiscene ""Lowest Common Denominator"" and the antiscag ""Ignore That Door."" These days the poï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""Staring in Her Eyes,"" where he explicitly surrenders his narcissistic nihilism to achieve the bliss described in the title.

I'm just not convinced he has his heart in it yet.

Preserving the backing tracks from the excellent 1982 album, which Hell disdains for murky reasons that may have to do with who owns it, while adding new guitar solos and new lead vocals, this offended me by expunging from the public record a major chunk of the late, nonpareil, under-recorded Robert Quine's tiny cache of rock solos. But Hell the 59-year-old arts professional renders the yelping anxiety of Hell the 31-year-old punk junkie with such sympathy it's hard to know who's who sometimes, and Marc Ribot, who doesn't record enough rock solos himself, is the nearest parallel to Quine extant. The original album, selling online as I write for $38 used and $153 new in CD form, sounds better than ever. I'm glad to own it and probably wouldn't buy both. But this is its own reward.

Like all the best CBGB bands, the Voidoids make unique music from a reputedly immutable formula, with jagged, shifting rhythms accentuated by Hell's indifference to vocal amenities like key and timbre. I'm no great devotee of this approach, which harks back to Captain Beefheart. So when I say that Hell's songs get through to me, that's a compliment: I intend to save this record for those very special occasions when I feel like turning into a nervous wreck.

Given that Hendrix is always a guitarist first, The Cry of Love seems like the verbal/vocal half of the double-LP he was planning when he died. Except for ""Dolly Dagger,"" now the single and a pretty conventional Hendrix song, what you notice here is the playing--the delicate ""Pali Gap,"" the relatively dignified (and pre-Woodstock) ""Star Spangled Banner,"" and the amazing blues jams of side two, especially the live ""Hear My Train a Coming."" Rich stuff, exploring territory that as always with Hendrix consists not merely of notes but of undifferentiated sound, a sound he shapes with a virtuosity no one else has ever achieved on an electric instrument.

Despite the introductory mini-medley of ""God Save the Queen"" and ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" from Isle of Wight--a great in-concert idea that doesn't have any business on a record--these San Diego (with the Experience) and Berkeley (with Cox and Mitchell) performances make a better live album than Band of Gypsys. Not all of it is historic, but ""Red House,"" done as a long blues jam marred briefly by a lazy unaccompanied passage, and ""Little Wing,"" stronger and freer than on Axis: Bold as Love (or Layla), are definitive. And so, heh heh, is ""Johnny B. Goode.""

Like Hendrix's other 1986 releases, this budget-priced mini-LP (time: 26:08) is vivid testimony to the uses of digital mastering for archival music, especially music recorded direct to two-track. ""The Star Spangled Banner"" and ""Machine Gun"" occupy the B, and while there's no need to own either twice, the powerful sound is at least a reason. On the A, a compressed, guitar-heavy ""Voodoo Chile"" and an intense ""Watchtower"" surround the disc's only previously released (though long unavailable) track, which provides the album title for good reason--it's the definitive version of the definitive guitar anthem. Roll over Chuck Berry and tell Keith Richards the news.

FALSE,A-,Band of Gypsys 2,Jimi Hendrix,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4954,"
I suppose side one of this belated sequel wasn't side two of the original because Jimi had a personal or Capitol a financial stake in such brotherhood bromides as ""Power of Soul"" and ""We Gotta Live Together."" But for better or worse he's a lot more impassioned working apolitical traditions--debuting ""Hear My Train a Comin'"" or reprising ""Foxy Lady"" or letting Buddy Miles cover Howard Tate's ""Stop."" What's more, the Hendrix classics by the Mitch Mitchell edition of Band of Gypsys on side two sound a lot fresher now than they would have fifteen years ago, and not just because pressing techniques have taken such a leap. Which makes the second first by me.

If it's getting like Coltrane, crazies examining umpteen versions of the same tune, Hendrix's versions do bear scrutiny like no other rock and roll. Noncrazies aren't obliged or even advised to make the effort, yet newcomers could just as well start with these BBC sessions as with Are You Experienced?, also cut when he still led kind of a pop band. Ace new stuff includes Curtis Knight's ""Drivin' South"" and Elvis Presley's ""Hound Dog.""

Your soul will survive if you never hear a moment of Reprise's brass-balled clearance boxes, Lifelines (radio music, radio chat) and Stages (four concerts! four cities! four years!). But on this ""new"" single disc, the Inexhaustible One sounds pretty fresh for somebody who's been dead 24 years. Even if you've heard him do most of these titles, even if you've committed Rainbow Bridge's ""Hear My Train A Comin'"" to memory, the simple concept and modest scope do right by his uniqueness, his diversity, and the mother of all subgenres.

Transitional--less definitive than Winterland early or Berkeley late. But more essential (also historic) than any other Hendrix concert record. The ad hoc Gypsy Sons and Rainbows band goes with Billy Cox on bass, picks Mitch's sticks over Buddy's bigfoot; two percussionists sit in for a snakier groove and Larry Lee adds extraneous guitar. The loosely rehearsed music sounds that way. But it's way, way out there--""The Star Spangled Banner"" is a bon-bon compared to ""Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)/Stepping Stone"" or ""Jam Back at the House (Beginnings)"" or the unaccompanied ""Woodstock Improvisation."" All in all, your basic rock concert as act of flawed genius. Does this kind of thing happen any more? Not on such a scale for sure.

This long-lost, new-to-CD album followed The Cry of Love in 1971, when slavemaster Mike Jeffery and some Warner Bros. overseers hired bereaved collaborator Eddie Kramer to make sense and of course dollars of the dead hero's vastness. Half of it reappeared on 1996's Kramer-overseen First Rays of the New Rising Son, a what-Jimi-wanted reconstruction that's always paled against Electric Ladyland. So probably the two in-the-moment profit-takers give us a better sense of who Hendrix was in the excited, spiritual, bummed-out sprawl of his final year. Among its rare gifts: a synthlike, pre-Woodstock ""Star Spangled Banner"" and the measured, lyrical ""Pali Gap.""

Although avant-guitarist Lucas accompanied and eventually managed Don Van Vliet during his mercurial 1978-1982 second coming, to reimagine him with post-soul artiste Hendryx he leans on Beefheart's blues-besotted youth. Ten of these dozen selections are from 1972 or before, and the two from 1967's Safe as Milk you may not believe are Beefheart at all--the Delta-as-desert ""Sure 'Nuff Yes I Do"" and ""I'm Glad,"" a doowop torch song the captain wasn't tender enough to nail himself. Gentle ain't exactly Hendryx's default mode either, but she knows how to fake it, then switches smoothly into the jagged ""Smithsonian Institute Blues."" On the whole, the album cants sensuous, Latinizing Beefheart's jagged groove--before climaxing with the nutso ""Tropical Hot Dog Night,"" which remains as much fun as two flamingos in a fruit fight.

Finally released in the States five years after it came out in Britain, this demanding music shows up such superstar ""progressives"" as Yes for the weak-minded reactionaries they are. The integrity of Cow's synthesis is clearest in ""Bittern Storm Over Ulm,"" based on the Yardbirds' ""Got to Hurry""--instead of quoting sixteen bars with two or three instruments, thus insuring their listeners another lazy identification, they break the piece down, almost like beboppers. Though the saxophone is still second-rate and the more lyrical rhythms flirt with a cheap swing, the band is worthy of its classical correlatives--Bartok, Stockhausen, and Varese rather than Tchaikovsky and predigested Bach.

Right, it's not ""rock""--it's modern chamber music utilizing ""Rock"" instruments, namely guitar-organ-drums, as well as brass and woodwinds of varying couth. It's jarring without valorizing the random, the way this group always is at its best, and it eschews the highbrow vocalizing favored by this group at its worst.

With well-respected albums on three major labels and boosters from Three Dog Night to Ry Cooder, Hiatt must be doing something wrong. Singing is my guess--just like Ry, he's immersed himself in the mannerisms of soul without enjoying access to its physical substance. But in the end this is his best album because the songs are so much his catchiest and pithiest. Most of them reflect smashed hopes. The tenderest is called ""She Loves the Jerk."" And of course the jerk ain't John.

FALSE,A-,Sings Bolling Greene,Dylan Hicks,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15773,"
This is complicated. Minneapolis critic and singer-songwriter Hicks recently published a debut novel called Boarded Windows, about which you can believe Dana Spiotta (""eloquent and unusual"") and Greil Marcus (""whispered, confided, mused"") or you can believe me (""buncha bohos wax clever about art until you want to paste someone""). Its seventh most important character is a country-singing aesthete of implausible renown named Bolling Greene. But these aren't simply Hicks's renditions of Greene's previously nonexistent songs. They're also songs about goings on in the novel itself to which Greene couldn't have been privy as well as a leftover about a golf course that, as Greene's widow complains in the notes, it's impossible to imagine the vaguely delineated cult hero writing. I love the first four and like all 10, because the same fine distinctions that make my teeth hurt at 252 pages are piquant at a hooky half hour of rhymes I can ignore at will. If you crave concrete detail in your songwriting, here's your fix, from ""West Texas wind/Blowing headlines in my lap/Lonely Man Takes Nap/Chubby Girl Learns Tap"" to ""The musty olive carpet/The sticky minibar/The grainy baby movie/The broken VCR.""

Singer-songwriters don't get more logocentric than the mild-mannered novelist-critic who dubbed his 1990 debut New Dylan. And though Dylanesque is not Hicks's way, I bet the guy he was named after is broad-minded enough to envy the observed likes of ""Hear the the snaps of your jeans banging in the drier"" and ""Time it flies like Superman / Or gets stuck like celery strands."" Vocally he's too smart to be wimpy, and a shifting band anchored by his cocktail piano accommodates horn section and pedal steel as needed. Hicks isn't above cleverness like ""I just wanna be the Monkees to your Beatles / Wanna be the heat lamp to your sun"" or ""Persephone and Dante were down there / Bon Scott I guess was en route,"" and why should he be? But his deepest couplet is ""You were interesting to me / Interesting to me,"" and his deepest song hard to penetrate: ""Ambulance,"" where a feeble parent or disabled child or someone else altogether may be scared of the siren, in deep need of the help it promises, both, or neither.

The ska pioneer and fourth Wailer is one of reggae's most respected writers of songs and singers of harmonies. He's been around too long to have much use for millenarian cant, and he's too honest to play the romantic stud--he sings about love because he needs it soul and body in the ghetto where he figures to spend the rest of his days, and at forty-five he feels like he's got a lot of days ahead of him. His weathered voice and reassuringly deep and unpredictable backup also articulate the way he understands the world.

But they top Arlo's wistful ""City of New Orleans"" as well as Bob Seger's mawkish ""Against the Wind,"" equal George's slapstick ""The King Is Gone,"" and forever define Robert Earl Keen's highwayman saga ""The Road Goes on Forever."" Also, believe it or not, they have politics: ""Welfare Line"" describes white people, ""American Remains"" shovels a foreclosure on top of a drought, and a crucial cameo from Johnny Rodriguez extracts every ounce of outrage from the Woody Guthrie classic properly entitled as it is here: ""Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos).""

The tunes sag toward the end the way tunes do, and shame on Hille for sticking in that ringer from ""Sexual Practices of the Japanese"".

Following his partner Kool A.D.'s more scattered Palm Wine Drinkard mixtape by just a few weeks, Das Racist's Heems comes up with a free album highlighted by two songs as strong as anything on Relax: ""Womyn,"" a theological codicil to the devotional ""Booty in the Air,"" and ""NYC Cops,"" a brutal, fact-filled catalogue of people of color dead by peace officer. It dips in the middle, and though the PSAs from Ravi Shankar and, if I'm not mistaken, the late great Jocko Henderson sustain themselves, the up-and-comer cameos--Action Bronson, Danny Brown, Mr. Muthafuckin Ed, Puerile Gambino--make you wish the new veteran would jump back in. And then, starting with the quasi-autobiographical ""Desi Shoegaze Taiko"" two thirds of the way in, the material rights itself so smartly you'd think he could do this forever. So remember that he can't and get it while you can.

Think of Hinds as the anti-Beach House. Where Victoria Legrand's cool continental tease gets more detached and high-handed as her brand matoors, the Madrid foursome want to be liked. So they play the girl group, deploying chops that recall the early Breeders to power a goofy insouciance that beefs up the spirit of the Chiffons and the Cookies. All into their twenties by now, they make no pretence to innocence, because by now they're not just club kids--they're club kids who've seen the world no matter how unpolished their English. But they're also good-hearted going on kind, and although they'd rather hitch up with someone who doesn't get night sweats or bang another baby when they're not looking, they remain in the love hunt as a matter of principle.

In which Al Green's sidemen, perhaps disgruntled at Al's unwillingness to record their material, get together and cut it. Some stickler for detail is sure to point out that the singing on side two is completely out of tune, but that's OK--so is most of the singing on side one, which I prefer to Full of Fire. One of the more carefully thought out tracks features a mildly malicious lyric about Green himself, but it's the eccentricity of the music, which sounds as if it includes a banjo, that does him in. Loose indeed.

FALSE,A-,Mouth By Mouth,His Name Is Alive,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1531,"
Proudly eclectic, reflective, and obscure--hell, arty--Warren DeFever's concession to rock normality is mood music for more moods than you'll first believe are there, including plenty of sex for the polymorphously inclined. Think Big Star's Third as witting aesthetic strategy rather than failed attempt to make the world go away. DeFever adds an electric flaneur's world-music collection and an extra coupla decades of pop-studio perversity to the sonic palette. Karin Oliver sings as if being pretty is a spiritual attainment.

Warren DeFever is the cook, but don't expect extra helpings from his side projects. HNIA's artistic flavor, half homespun mysticism and half hermetic cutes, is all in Karin Oliver's cunning, simplistic verbal/vocal content. And the whole exercise in fey sexuality and childlike quietude would fall slightly flat without its greatest hit--three takes on a Woody Guthrie tune about how he was even more alienated than they are.

The Hives explode where a hundred other punk bands are proud to rock. If they're not openhearted like Rancid they're also not cute like Green Day, who dominated that punk revival anyway, and I'll take their wage-slave rants over the Strokes' ass-man ennui any day. Really, so what if Max Martin writes 'em?

FALSE,A-,Separation Sunday,The Hold Steady,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12855,"
Confession booths are for rosary twiddlers, but Bible lore is as American as Sunday school, so I take the scriptural references as tokens of Craig Finn's quality education. And since in my Sunday school, papists like my grandpa were going to burn forever because they never got ""born again,"" I'm glad Finn's guys and gals get ""born again"" too. At bottom, his people are my people, and I wish them the same shot at heaven my adolescent Billy Graham experience guarantees my reprobate ass. Which is to say that this literature with power chords addresses not only the crucial matter of vanishing bohemias as cultural myth but also the crucial matter of re-emerging spiritualities as cultural fact. From ""Lord to be 17 forever"" to ""Lord to be 33 forever"" is a long road, and Finn is old enough now to know it keeps getting longer--and to spread the living gospel that 33 is too good to throw away on myths.

Sasha Frere-Jones has nominated the Mountain Goats, and now the Decemberists come to mind even though their songs are fictive rather than reported/recollected/observed, but for me the nearest parallel to this band is the Drive-By Truckers. Both bands match the descriptions they stuff into their traditional narrative structures to a specific rock tradition: Skynyrd-Allmans for the Truckers' songs of the South, Springsteen for Hold Steady's new generation of shadows in the backstreets. That said, this album lays it on too thick--all right already with the keyb flourishes, which suit their mawkish new emo label all too well--and declines the thematic burden of Separation Sunday. As stories, on the other hand, the songs could convince anyone that kids have a hard time--without giving whiners any sort of go-ahead to throw their lives away. All accomplished without directly referencing ye olde rock-and-roll lifestyle--unless you count ""Chillout Tent,"" in which two strangers freak at a festival and live to make out about it. But that's about fans, not bands. This band is for the fans.

On Halloween 2006, a decade-plus after choosing the unremunerative lifework of hanging around Bar Band Nation without falling in, Craig Finn climaxes a tour that's had him selling out thousand-seaters and knows it's too soon to stop now. Like the Raspberries when they were in it for the hits not the sales, he's in it for the house not the gate. And he's so psyched as he watches those houses get bigger that he invests his excellent story-songs with an emotion their excellent studio versions have never matched--though maybe now they will.

Most people don't like her, and actually, I don't either. So I can't claim you owe it to yourself to enjoy Courtney Love's much-delayed first-album-since-2004. Nor even that these songs cast a revealing light of her scabrous persona--beyond ""Pacific Coast Highway"" (""I'm overwhelmed and undersexed"") and ""Never Go Hungry"" (""I don't care what I have to pretend""), they're typical wails of punk-schooled rage from ""Skinny Little Bitch"" to ""Letter to God."" Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What's more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I know--for her, BP Petroleum is just something else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless.

Sweets for the sweet--they knew what they were doing when they closed with a ditty called ""Ye Olde Toffee Shop.""

Ignoring their barren stint with Mikael ""Swedish Invasion"" Rikfors, they add ""Bus Stop,"" ""On a Carousel,"" and four other Imperial sillyditties to six Epic tracks, including their three American successes of the '70s. This has the effect of underplaying their most durable froth, the early Epic music with Graham Nash--the ersatz Pepperpomp of ""King Midas in Reverse"" is a lot closer to their essence than the ""sincerity"" of ""He Ain't Heavy."" The programming is a mess, too. But it's the one Hollies album to own if one etc., as well as a decent LP with ""Long Cool Woman"" on it.

In an era when Donna and Diana and Natalie aim (truly) to reintroduce Josephine Baker to the great American public, this black woman extends the sexy mama tradition of rhythm and blues. Her sweet grit and tough wit are alternately abusive and forgiving, coy and defenseless, and she's got some voice. ""I May Not Be There When You Want Me,"" a Bunny Sigler song that rocks as hard as any black music I've heard this year, is also available as a disco disc, but even the few mediocre cuts on this album are of interest, and it includes a version of ""You Light Up My Life"" that beats Patti Smith's all to hell.

FALSE,A-,Actual Factual Pterodactyl,Homeboy Sandman,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14270,"
This logorrheic rhymer says he comes music first, which means extended loops from anywhere: speed-rock, roots dancehall, humming and whistling, Bach or somebody, Jon Hassell or somebody, Kenna nailing his Thom Yorke impression. On the one about the ill-fated mambo contest, there's a mambo; on ""I-Tunes Song,"" there's an intrusive jingle. But though the loops have some jam and Kenna will never sound better, what sustains is the words. Some you'll get right away, others you'll let pass with your head spinning. But they'll be there waiting. Conscious enough, Homeboy loves to play, which greatly enhances his wisdom hear how ""Or"" arrays 200-odd ""or"" rhymes: ""I am a sight for sore orbs/Flow like a cyborg albacore."" Married to this hip-hop for richer or poorer, he's never been divorced. His brand of hip-hop is nothing like yours.

FALSE,A-,The Good Sun,Homeboy Sandman,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15605,"
He's a believer--once withdrew from a freestyling contest rather than rhyme to a gunshot beat. He's a vegan who forswears cursewords and caffeine although not reefer, brags about how poor he is, and is avowedly ""not pop."" But he's no ascetic. His songs come equipped with brief melodic hooks, his rapid rhymes brim with delight, and from gravelly to singsong his flow is always ready for whatever comes next. Sandman has heard the insult knuckleheads aim at every rapper who makes them feel guilty: ""Maybe you think I'm whinin' like BeBe and CeCe."" But he knows he rhymes for love and for the fun of it, and so will you.
"
FALSE,A-,First of a Living Breed,Homeboy Sandman,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15815,"
Between speed of delivery and brevity of line, Sandman's nonstop tunefulness here tends jingly no matter how gritty his flow. So listen up, Goya Foods--he's a Dominican vegan with an old rhyme called ""Canned Goods,"" and if you're real nice maybe he'll let you attach it to a garbanzo commercial. As a sucker for babies, let me praise the sample that runs through the ""Wear Clean Draws"" variant ""For the Kids""; as an elder, let me remind those who've forgotten (as I had) that the treated verbalese of ""Cedar &amp; Sedgwick"" namechecks the birthplace of hip-hop. Sandman's rhymes are so unfailing I wish he'd tell stories as well as pile on rhetoric, because rhetoric is harder to sustain at the level of interest he deserves. I also wish his best album didn't recycle one standout each from his two 2012 EPs. But there aren't many rappers who can top a strong collection with a progress report on their careers which credibly reports that the nicest thing about earning money is having more to give away and transforms a diffidently childish ""not really"" into a dynamite hook. I mean, what a boast: ""Not really.""

FALSE,A-,Subject: Matter,Homeboy Sandman,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15606,"
He says this EP's subjects matter because no other hip-hopper has touched them, and except for the opener about his creative process, he's got a right, as in the one about his material possessions thatincludes his sock drawer. His beats stick, and even when he's merely rhyming there's a musicality there: ""Carpe diem/As a.m. turn to the p.m./The zone I be in/Muy bien."" From the grounded erotic obsession of ""Unforgettable"" to the down-in-the-flood nightmares of ""Soap,"" he's got a vision. And nowhere is his subject matter more materialistic--philosophically, and maybe even dialectically--than in ""Canned Goods"": ""Other food spoils much quicker/The spoils go to the victors.""

After throwing down 34 straight long-""E"" rhymes over a Philip Glass beat and cutting them short with a ""Damn, I said 'street' before,"" the self-starter explains why America ain't so bad--legal protections and consumer goods that add up to ""We are the 99 per cent locally/We are the one percent globally."" And although the percentage is more like five for most Americans, the perspective is tonic from a man who's always been as class-conscious as alt-rap gets. Fine with me that he's no longer vegan. Fine with me that ""Personal Ad"" is a sex boast few this side of Jay-Z would have the cool or balls to pull off.

Strictly on the down-low (is that the phrase?), Angel del Villar has recorded more quality long-players than anyone over the past decade. He's not a great--his sibilantly articulated flow just isn't as beautiful as Jay Z's, Lil Wayne's, or Nicki Minaj's. But when I wanted to demur mildly from his 2013 All That I Hold Dear, all I could do was quote his perturbed ""How can an artist make too much art?"" The answer is for the artist to fall in with a disrespected genre, as alt-rap seems doomed to remain, kinda like polka. His staccato three- and four-beat lines suit the rhyme-mad verbiage and moral directness you should love him for, and it's nice that he adds a common touch and a sense of humor. Highlights here are the lyrical ""Heart Sings,"" the rousing ""Real New York,"" the unrequited ""Sly Fox,"" the religious ""God,"" and the more religious ""Speak Truth."" Give him a fucking break, willya?
"
FALSE,A-,Veins,Homeboy Sandman,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17217,"
Given how it signs off by wrapping ""God"" and ""Speak Truth"" around ""Nonbelievers""' and its ""light brown privilege"" verse, 2016's 16-track, 40-minute Kindness for Weakness feels so much like a signature classic that this 10-track, 25-minute follow-up seems trifling despite its identical minutes-per-song ratio. But on both albums, Sand remains the most consistent song-crafter in whatever we're supposed to call the game he's playing. Accept his rat-a-tat delivery and his looplike beats and recognize how rarely he lets four lines pass without proving that ""Every single morning I handle boredom by being born again."" Never one ""to waste time tryna be cute,"" he rocks his ""Fila and Le Tigre on the Tigris and Euphrates,"" reads Moby Dick between sets, and delivers delight. If his flow and beats were a smidge more iconic, he'd epitomize the kind of major minor artistry Le Tigre--hell, Spoon or somebody--parlayed into legend.

His beatmaking proudly utilitarian, his quick tetrameters and plosive rat-a-tat-tat too abrupt to fully earn the glorious old metaphor flow, the heroically consistent Homeboy has never been quite musical enough. Hence this partnership with the seldom heard undergrounder Edan, whose electronics heighten and sometimes carry the vocals Homeboy dominates. On the lead ""Grim Seasons,"" Edan's sound effects dramatize Homeboy's rundown of a year's weather from winter's black ice to autumn's fallen. On the closer he extends human evolution similar support. And his looped, massaged fanfare carries ""The Gut"" front to back. But best by far is the Homeboy-dominated ""#Neverusetheinternetagain,"" which deserves to go viral for running down every waste of brain power virality has wrought.

Shortly after the 2004 living-room collection Killers and Stars, the Drive-By Trucker and great American songwriter figured out a better way to make a solo album: not just with a band, duh, but with never-recorded mementos of his intermittently wasted late 20s juxtaposed against tokens of fatherhood at 40 and other life satisfactions. Took a while to get off the back burner, but the simmering helped it blend. Hood is too inclined toward dark-side thoughts and the world too inclined toward dark-side realities for the newer songs to come off complacent. But like the best Nashville vets, he knows enough to root both ""Granddaddy,"" an optimistic take on having a kid, and ""Pride of the Yankees,"" a worried one, in telling details, personal and historical respectively. The alt-rock vet he is takes time to level a few harsh words at old fling Courtney Love. But here's one thing that makes him a great American songwriter--they're tempered by kind ones.

Musically, several if not many notches above the new generation of look-sis-no-lessons grrrls. Frances Quinlan sings, writes, plays, and makes it be, her brother Mark Quinlan bangs the drums steadily, there's a dedicated bassist, and Philly guitarist-producer Joe Reinhart is a force. Not virtuosos but not newbies either, they recall Pavement both ways, with the crucial distinction that Quinlan's lyrics hint at the concrete situations and emotions shrewd 90s ironists eschewed and arty millennial obscurantists look down on. Quite a singer, Quinlan--tiptoeing along the edge of her range, she often leaps or tumbles into the unknown. And every time she does, there's a chance your heart will jump with her.

Trailing such dubiously prestigious credits as Coldplay, King Creosote, and the later Brian Eno, U.K. keyboardist Hopkins established his solo name back in 2013 with this album, the kind of conceptual electronica only techno aesthetes expect anyone to dance to. And for most of us, it will function just as nicely now as it did then--as rhythmic mood music that strolls back and forth across the line between the mildly bracing and the casually kind. Notice, for instance, how the sizzly midtempo zips and thwocks of the unhurried 10-minute ""Collider"" gain volume and texture before they resolve into the brief, string-fed piano etude ""Abandon Window."" This is the Eno we weren't smart enough to dream of back when all options were open.

His juke-joint records long out of juice, Hopkins unplugged because he saw money in folk music. Like a quality gangsta rapper, he was cold, wry, and into his own pain, a ruminative cuss who moved white fans to rave about improvisation as they worshipfully awaited whatever bullshit came out of his mouth. Of this there was way too much--he recorded more than John Lee Hooker, who unlike Hopkins had a beat. That said, Rhino's selection of 16 1947-1961 tracks from nine labels is the solidest album ever to bear his name. Usually there's accompaniment, bass at least, but Hopkins's phrasing is so wayward that the effect is country anyway. Winnowed down to these memorable performances, he's thoughtful and soulful, evocative and surprising--the back-porch poet of folk dreams.

Techno plus ragga plus bhangra plus West Asia plus Eastern Europe equals fully multicultural fusions that invariably misfire in the end. But this one sparks like I'd hoped Fun-Da-Mental would--which means it sounds like nothing I've heard.

Many were recorded in identical versions with equally anonymous sidemen for yet other L.A. indies, and only six were released. Yet I feel as if I've been waiting for this collection all my life. Sax reissues by the likes of Illinois Jacquet and Arnett Cobb retain a veneer of structural respectability, just like the official singles here--they're never all-out all-out. But at its best--which despite the fine thick raunch of the slow blues usually means its fastest, from famous flag-wavers like ""Flying Home"" and ""Lester Leaps In"" to prototypical jams like ""Richie's Roll"" and ""Coastin'""--most of this sounds as if the engineer is holding the mike stand parallel to the floor because Houston is flat on his back.

That's why I never checked him out seriously, shelving his first album on his wife's label even though it showcased a Hayes Carll co-write I relished. Reaccessing that record now--its sobriety-inspired title: A: Enlightenment B: Endarkenment (Hint: There Is No C)--I decided the problem wasn't the vocals, but Hubbard's decision to prove that he considers Muddy Waters ""as deep as Blake"" by grooving his blues downtempo. The follow-up is his party record, and deeper as a consequence, dark and hilarious and gone so fast you're too busy tapping your inner foot to cavil about pitch or timbre. So permit me to complete that ""Gates of Hell"" couplet: ""But I can quote Martin Luther King."" And then add another one: ""They're burning over there with the Fox News whores/Oh look is that the singer for the Doors?"" (BTW: it isn't.)

A John Darnielle sideman and philosophy Ph.D. who wrote a 33 1/3 on Elvis C.'s Armed Forces, Franklin Bruno knows pop from the beginning--19th-century sheet music. He delivers these songs with a brass-tacks brio that recalls the songsmith-sung demos on a Cole Porter comp and also plays all keyboards and most guitars. Love the Costello-without-shame opener and the title tune that's all quarter-of-three Sinatra. But my avorites on this consistently and straightforwardly songful album are the rocking ""Cheap Sunglasses,"" about the girlfriend he saw through, and the rhumbaing ""Not Just When We Kiss,"" about the one he stuck with. It's not Brad Paisley's ""Then."" But it belongs on the same mixtape.

It's a given that octogenarians like Sam Chatmon, Eubie Blake, even George Burns have more vitality than just about any singing war baby you care to name--they prove that by breathing. But life-begins-at-eighty isn't really Hunter's secret, except insofar as it deepens her wisdom, which isn't a given at all. It's not like Bessie Smith raising her voice among us, because Hunter is less titanic. But she spins her blues and gospel and pop with the spontaneous affection not just of somebody who never knew there was a difference between art and entertainment but of somebody who had the heart to leave show business and work as a nurse for twenty-three years. Her raunch (""You Can't Tell the Difference After Dark"") is as unforced as her love of God (""Ezekiel Saw the Wheel"") and her female indomitability (""I've Had Enough""), and her band plays even better than she sings.

Exemplary discophilia. The Mott 45s on side one are all the young stiffs--great album tracks edited down for an AM exposure that was rarely forthcoming, they race along with an almost punky punch on LP. The B sides and miscellaneous on side two are uneven, natch, but worth getting to know (as owners of Greatest Hits have already learned with two of them). Those circumspect enough to have passed up Ian's two solo albums are now rewarded with side three's best-of. And side four excerpts the solo Ian that was never released here to impressive effect. A genuinely obsessive compilation.

Although Hurt was beloved in his time--from his first Northern gigs in 1963 at age 69 until his death at 73--his story isn't the stuff of blues legend. A lifelong sharecropper who raised 14 kids with one woman, he was the least dangerous-looking of the '60s rediscoveries, which is one reason folkies found him so irresistible. But however suspect hardboiled postmoderns may find his rep, his music is damn near unique. The school of John Fahey proceeded from his finger-picking, and while he's not the only quietly conversational singer in the modern folk tradition, no one else has talked the blues with such delicacy or restraint. Since his approach didn't sap his adrenaline or testosterone and his skills matured with the years, the many albums he cut in his seventies (try Rounder's casual Worried Blues 1963, or Vanguard's sweetly eerie Last Sessions) betray none of the diminishment of late Son House or Bukka White. Yet these crisp, detailed digital remasters from half a lifetime before pack an added authority: they establish that the gentleness of his music in no way reflects the frailty of a defenseless old age. Emanating from vocal cords that have plenty spring in them at 35, his equanimity seems chosen and vigorous, as befits a major 20th-century artist.

And I get a kick out of the whole fucking thing, right down to the fourteen-minute guitar showcase/mantra that finishes it off. But though I hate to sound priggish, I do think it could have used a producer. I mean, it was certainly groovy (not to mention manly) to record first takes and then mix down for forty hours straight, but sometimes the imperfections this economical method so proudly incorporates could actually be improved upon. It wouldn't be too much of a compromise to make sure everyone sings into the mike, for instance, and it's downright depressing to hear Bob Mould's axe gather dust on its way from vinyl to speakers. Who knows, put them in the studio with some hands-off technician--Richard Gottehrer, Tony Bongiovi, like that--and side two might even qualify as cathartic music rather than cathartic noise.

They invented this barrage, and they've perfected it: for close to seventy minutes, songs rise out of the roiling seas like elephant seals, bellow their hooks, and sink sleekly away. But there's a downside to the overwhelming consistency of what those who take the title literally assume is a hodgepodge. Now that they've mastered the feat of yoking elemental noise and elemental melody, their power of musical expression has apparently rendered irrelevant the meaning of individual songs. So that almost as soon as you notice one--Grant""You're a Soldier,"" with its sermon to the enemy, or Bob Mould's ""It's Not Peculiar,"" with its stuttered refrain--you're not sure you trust it.

Culled from their final tour, their second live album--the first was their first, with the lovely protohardcore title Land Speed Record--is long on late songs, its only cover the ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker."" But the mutual disregard that had set in well before their demise never dented their reputation as the fiercest band in el nuevo wavo. Their ordinary shows were something else, and given how dimly they were recorded at SST, the live-to-the-soundboard audio is often an improvement. Not an epiphany. But definitely a manifestation you can believe in.

This is the kind of reggae most Americans dismiss as impossibly monotonous: the melodies are simple and often repetitive, the singing plaintive and crude, the words barely literate. I'm not claiming any of these qualities are virtues in themselves, but they can be. Working a shameless variation on Gregory Isaacs, Hussey projects intense innocence of a sort increasingly rare in English-language music; replete with homy references to liniment and parlors and pajamas, his sexual musings and militant pacifism must seem a little uncool even in Kingston. And for those with ears to hear, he's backed by the Roots Radics, who are far from succumbing to the subtler monotony that eventually afflicts great studio bands.

Her father walked out when she was two and killed himself soon enough; her mother was a factory worker turned bootlegger turned alcoholic. She joined Vincent Lopez's band at 15, threw him over a couple of years later, and signed with Hollywood's newly formed Capitol label in 1942 at age 21. She cut all 17 of these tracks in the '40s, and although her career extended into the '60s, what with drugs, booze, bankruptcy, a failed suicide, and, eventually, God, it didn't get better. People who think slow signifies serious compliment Hutton's ballads, but then, people who think brass signifies class praise Paul Weston's horns. What endures in her music is its kid's pizzazz--sassy spunk and uptempo jive that wisecrack right past the melody sometimes. With special help from Frank Loesser's vernacular, she's the cornfed blonde next door as backslapping joker-around, and she buys no bullshit. She makes fun of factory work, motherhood, marriage; she spoofs Shakespeare, barely respects Irving Berlin, and has a ball with ""Papa Don't Preach to Me."" So what if she was a movie star? Paul Weston notwithstanding, she's as rock and roll as Ruth Brown or Ella Mae Morse--and she has better material.

They tour too much too convince me they're cowboys at heart. They're entertainers--cowboys set on quitting their day jobs. And good at it, too. Where Smithsonian's classic CDs of central Asian throat singing are forbiddingly culture-specific, these will grab world-music dabblers if not alternative stick-in-the-muds. The hook is the technique, in which a single vocalist produces two or three harmonics in perfect unison. But that's just the exotic new sound--it's the mood of the music that makes it more than a dog-and-pony show. Songs and tunes are so allegro they sound thoughtfully devotional even when they aren't, which is usually; the traditional fiddle and percussion accompaniment admits a guitar now and then. We all know about weirdness that fetishizes its own alienation, and most of us need it. Some of us are also cheered and awed by weirdness at home with itself.

Pining for his South African home, where American jazz has long symbolized black possibility, Ibrahim syncretizes. Relinquishing neither the modernist idiosyncrasy that underpins his exile nor the big-band entertainment values that have shored up the townships for close to half a century, he roots himself in the shared melodies and rhythms that give South African jazz its sound. Except maybe for tenor man Ricky Ford, the all-Americans who complete his Ekaya octet aren't great improvisors, but Ibrahim writes to their strengths and adds plenty of his own. Ekaya was more exuberant, but as inspiriting as I find the lilt of ""Mandela"" and ""Manenberg Revisited,"" it's the brooding spiritual reserves of side two that convince me of Ibrahim's power. Not only does this artist have something to be serious about, he's found a way to make it breathe.

Cape Town-born pianist Dollar Brand won Down Beat polls in the '60s, when his idols Monk and Ellington were still active, because beneath his enticing fusion of modernist ambition and African authenticity he had at his disposal a store of simple tunes and beats Americans had never experienced firsthand. These later recordings, which begin with his second exile in 1976 and continue through the defeat of apartheid, no longer sound exotic-1985's ""Mandela"" we can now hear as pure township jazz, a jaunty classic put through its paces by a horn section featuring Carlos Ward's alto and Ricky Ford's tenor. I mention those names in part because the notes neglect to; Ibrahim couldn't have made his impact without American sidemen and frontmen feeling along with him, as several of the solo pieces here bear out. Nevertheless, the fusion was his idea, and his prophecy. After all, what young jazzman today would turn up his nose at the history encapsulated in a jaunty tune?

It leads with two of hip-hop's great anti-moralizing sermons, the Snoop- and Lil Jon-powered ""Go to Church"" and the grinder's credo ""A Bird in the Hand,"" then proceeds to his greatest song, the fact-filled paraplegic memoir ""Ghetto Vet.""

What's dissonant is that you wouldn't figure from all this baritone bellow and jackboot four-four how much political rage they direct at sexism--the first three songs attack what ""Samaritans"" later brands ""the mask of masculinity."" It's like Joe Talbot's vocals are the male equivalent in reverse of Snail Mail or Lucy Dacus embracing sad femininity in gender solidarity. Though Talbot insists the Idles aren't a punk band, his unrelenting politics do remind one that he lacks both Joe Strummer's stealth tenderness and John Lydon's wormwood sarcasm. But a warmth suffuses ""Danny Nedelko,"" about a Ukrainian pal who stands as Zanzibar-born Freddy Mercury's immigrant brother, and ""June,"" all tender love for his stillborn daughter.

Strict constructionists and lo-fi snobs charge indignantly that by remixing his own album Iggy has made a mockery of history and done irreparable damage to a priceless work of art. This is really stupid. Before it was anointed the Platonic idea of rock and roll by desperate young men who didn't have much else to choose from, first-generation Iggyphiles charged just as indignantly that David Bowie had mixed the real thing way too thin--as Iggy observes, this classic-by-comparison always sounded ""weedy"" (although, not to insult a valued colleague, ""David's"" version was also ""very creative""). So the pumped bass and vocals Iggy has uncovered on the original tapes, which were supposed to coexist with their high-end screech to begin with, are a quantum improvement. Plus you can finally hear the celeste on ""Penetration""--sounds great! Only the slow ones, which like all of Iggy's slow ones are not as good as his fast ones, stand between a statement of principle and a priceless work of art.

With nary a nod at the virtuosities of desert guitar gods like Bombino, their second international release rocks without hesitation or apology. So if you're one of the mutants who's moved by this groove, go for it.

They're true to their alt-bred school--foggier and coyer, yet sweeter than ever if you prove you love them, and hardly averse to reminding whoever's listening that they're ""fucking congressmen,"" say.

Pop isn't an ambition for these smart people with other things to do, it's a discipline--the tunes strong, the beats solid, the vocals lightly yearning and pungently sweet. As if they've actually been listening to the radio (watching MTV, more likely), they bear down on the rhythm tracks, which I hope doesn't mean they think the whoos and handclaps on ""Baby"" will get buzz-binned in this day and age.

Where Sonic Youth are at least sonic, these men and women are far from imperial. Just masterful. They sharpen their hooks and spin their lyrics not for art's sake, but for the artists' pleasure, and for the ears and minds of their discerning fans. The result are songs that illuminate a subcultural dilemma other bands ignore or wallow in: how it feels to stick with your music even when you are going on middle age is plenty full without it. ""Room With a View,"" with the ""20 for life"" line everybody quotes, lays out the terms. But the opener's ""Pump my heart until/Bleeding heart be still"" is just as apt. Can't last forever.

It might even be easier for a guy to identify with her, although since women tend both more empathetic and more polymorphous than men, maybe not. But either way there's a healthy temptation to believe Syd's desire is also affection. Her small, confident, capable voice is tough because, as a lesbian competing in a man's world both musically and erotically, she has to be tough. But it's also tender.

And fine though she is solo, you can hear why she sticks with her group. Steve Lacy's skittering subtlety on guitar and solid quietude on bass suit what we might as well call her spirituality, a gentleness that never comes across genteel or weak or connects explicitly to her unassuming lesbianism, although you begin to sense a yen for serious romance after enough fooling around. ""Look What U Started"" is a kissoff song. But not only do you believe she's in the right, you notice how unvindictive she sounds. And then you go back and suss that ""Next Time/Humble Pie"" posits a second meet-up with a honey she has her eye on before she can finally dare a simple ""I said hello.""

Latin jazz-rock for real, from Cuba. They're hot, they have amazing chops, and they've absorbed four continents' worth of music--who else would back an African ""mass"" (explosive) with a Mozart adagio (unintegrated)? Next time I hope they get to record in a studio rather than a concert.

FALSE,A-,Best of Gregory Isaacs Volume 2,Gregory Isaacs,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5011,"
Jamaica's reigning crooner is what people mean when they say reggae all sounds the same. Like most great popsters, he has a genius for the disarmingly memorable ditty, but initially he makes Shoes or the Ramones sound like a veritable smorgasbord. And while James Brown is an apter analogy, Brown's rhythmic attack is just that--vocally and instrumentally, he aims to get you up on one leg doing splits, while Isaacs and his band favor the skank, that metasexual trance best described as trucking in place. Me, I think he's kind of great. Prolonged exposure to this collection of mostly recut hits reveals his hooks at their semiglossiest, his usually romantic lyrics at their dreadest, his rhythm players at their trickiest, and his cool, drooning baritone at its most plaintive and hypnotic.

FALSE,A-,My Number One,Gregory Isaacs,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6191,"
Isaacs has got to be the sameyest great artist in pop history--though I own only four of these 13 tracks from his big youth on Alvin Ranglin's GG label, two of them on a tape I haven't played since I got it, just about every tune sounded like an old friend after a brief, casual interchange, because just about every one has been sending its cousins by for years. Coolly crooning lyrics that declare for self-determination up against romance or oppression, caressing and suffering with equal imperturbability, Isaacs is the aural image of an unconquerable, ganja-guzzling serenity. With ace toasters pitching in on four de facto disco discs, this is the U.S. release that will convince doubters until he gets the boxed set he deserves.

FALSE,A-,Best of Volumes One and Two,Gregory Isaacs,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1461,"
After roots reggae and before dancehall there was lovers rock, a tag devised for U.K.-based women singers and soon seized by JA crooners who'd never escaped their tight little island. Usually for good reason, too--if you don't believe me, check out Dennis Brown next time you have a week to kill. But even if few non-Jamaicans know it, the equally prolific Isaacs--I bet by now he's recorded 500 songs--is a master. Cooly crooning lyrics that declare for self-determination up against romance or oppression, caressing and suffering with equal imperturbability, he's the aural image of an unconquerable, ganja-guzzling serenity. This showcases keepers from back when sheathing his sexism and talking that dread both came naturally, though great titles like ""Slave Master"" and ""Night Nurse"" and ""Extra Classic"" would follow, as would a sweeter version of the chilled baritone he eventually macked to shreds. It supplants the now semiredundant My Number One as your chance to decide whether to agitate for a box.

Although his alt-Americana base may find him less ""authentic"" now, it's a musical positive that getting sober has finally cheered Isbell up. The resigned confidence of his singing signifies mental health. His contained Alabama drawl and guitar-bass-drums aesthetic mark his people as Southern whites of modest prospects subject to the ""powder keg ready to blow"" that is God's will. Talk of The Bell Jar and ""character sets"" mark him as a participant-observer while reminding bicoastalists how many Southern whites of modest prospects live in a larger world than bicoastalists imagine.

Not counting them Beefheart digs, this triple is the single-artist box of the year by acclamation, and why not? It does an honorable job on a significant band whose catalog cries out for landscaping. And compared to the completist monoliths on the Isleys from UA and RCA, it distinguishes hills from dales pretty nice. But folks, this is only the Isley Brothers. They gave us ""Twist and Shout"" and ""It's Your Thing"" and, um, ""That Lady,"" they hired Jimi Hendrix young and learned a few things, they formed their own label and held on like heroes. They have a great single disc in them. But who's up for canonization next? Frankie Beverly and Maze?

Took this for yet another of JA's hookless wonders until Bob Palmer advised me to concentrate on the singing, at which point I realized that the precise harmonies framing Keith Porter's Marleyesque tenor were fine gospel music. Except for a perfunctory nod to lovers rock and a ""thou shalt not steal"" for ganja pirates, every one of these dauntless outcries of tribulation and deliverance could be sung comfortably (with a few modifications of terminology) by African Methodists on a Sunday morning, and in a few cases I bet they'd know the tunes.

She's still Janet Jam-Lewis to me--Quincy Jones's natural bodily rhythms are nothing like Thriller's, but every Flyte Tyme production has showed off these angular beats. Not so smashingly is all--if the P-Funk pretensions of ""nation"" are a little much from somebody whose knowledge of the world is based on the 6 o'clock news, the ""rhythm"" is real, and I give her credit for it. Her voice is as unequal to her vaguely admonitory politics as it was to her declaration of sexual availability, but the music is the message: never before have Jam &amp; Lewis rocked so hard for so long. Best slow stuff: the murmured moans and irregular breathing of the sexually available ""Someday Is Tonight.""

At least the money that went into this obscenely expensive record comes back as physical luxury: the difference between hearing it on a cheap box and a booming system is the difference between daydreaming about sex and having somebody's crack in your face. Which is only one way it's more pornographic than obscene. And which doesn't make it Jam &amp; Lewis's. This achievement is Janet's, period--those who disagree should send me the name of that hot number in the S.O.S. Band they couldn't wait to boff. Better nose than Michael, better navel than Madonna, better sex than either.

Why do I believe that this self-made object's mild kink and coyly matter-of-fact bisexuality are functions of flesh pure and simple? That for her sex really is about pleasure rather than power--or even, except as a side issue, love? Because her sex songs are flavorful where her love songs are all cliche, and because her much-berated fluting little-girl timbre whispers innocence even when she's loosening her new friend's pretty French gown. So in the absence of total personal fulfillment, here's hoping she retains her ability to feign delight, to fool herself as well as everyone else.

I'm converted. Because it's possible to believe that their sincerity is neither feigned nor foolish, it's good in theory for children to sing romantic ballads. The reason it doesn't work is that the sincerity is so transparently manipulated from above. At 16, however, Michael's voice combines autonomy and helpless innocence in effective proportions. He also gets production help from Brian Holland (who begins one side like Barry White and the other like the Ohio Players) and a few romantic ballads (sure hit: ""One Day in Your Life"") that are as credible on their own terms as the rockers.

FALSE,A-,Dangerous,Michael Jackson,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2375,"
It's hard to hear through the oversell, but--especially if you ignore the faith-hope-and-charity, bringing it down under an hour--this is plainly his most consistent album since Off the Wall, a step up from Bad even if its hookcraft is invariably secondary and its vocal mannerisms occasionally annoying. Teddy Riley acting alone has never manufactured such abrasively unpredictable beats, much less the singer to top them--if they're not as catchy as a 10-year-old might hope, that's just Michael riding the rhythmic moment, as always. And though it's futile to analyze the love life of an invisible man who's convinced he's more popular than the Beatles now, he's hawking the most credible sex-and-romance of his career. ""In the Closet"" implores his mystery woman to keep their--get this--""lust"" behind closed doors. Soon he's going wild, or fabricating desperate nostalgia for their used-to-be. And then he's muttering ""Can't Let Her Get Away"" through clenched teeth--mantralike, over and over into the void. Coulda happened, doncha think? With Brooke Shields maybe?
"
FALSE,A-,Invincible,Michael Jackson,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10913,"
Jackson's obsession with fame, his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth, are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that he's a great musician is now often forgotten. I use the present tense because (a) his skills seem undiminished and (b) as only Frank Kogan has listened dispassionately enough to remark, he's doing new stuff with them--his funk is steelier and his ballads are airier, both to disquieting effect. At 78 minutes this is too long, and especially given his history, ""The Lost Children"" is offensive. But the first three tracks are the Rodney Jerkins of the year, ""2000 Watts"" is the Teddy Riley of the past five years, and even the prunables offer small surprises. Don't believe the hype matters.
"
FALSE,A-,Caught Up,Millie Jackson,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2413,"
Jackson rights the flaws of a promising career with this concept album about infidelity. The other woman starts an eleven-minute version of ""If Loving You Is Wrong"" by talking big, briefly allows herself some typical other-woman complaints, reasserts her independence, then suddenly finds her predicament untenable. She gets better lines than the wife's, which are on side two, but any artist sharp enough to cut through the overstatement of Brad Shapiro (production) and Bobby Goldsboro (one lyric) won't let that ruin her record. If you liked Quadrophenia (or still recall ""A Quick One""), you have no excuse for not liking this.

Millie was made for live albums, as the rap-and-belt format of her studio work suggests, and the drama here, with its raunchy audience interplay, is at least as natural as anything she's ever devised for vinyl. Her timing keeps getting sharper, her voice keeps getting bigger, the songs amount to a best-of, and you also get a monologue about soap operas and the ""Phuck U Symphony."" Certainly her best since the Caught Up diptych, and probably definitive.
"
FALSE,A-,Totally Unrestricted! The Millie Jackson Anthology,Millie Jackson,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6049,"
Maybe the reason rock fans have never gotten this brassy, bawdy, moralistic yenta isn't that she's too black but that she's too country--starting with 1974's Caught Up, she's adapted a powerful yet not finally distinctive delivery to half-spoken sexual-domestic minidramas that still sell tickets in the South, often as fully scripted theater pieces. Of course, I mean country in worldview, not geography. The implicit locale here is the kind of black lower-middle class neighborhood that takes another hit with each new ""economic downturn""--in bed as everywhere else. Jackson describes this world as if she's internalized Billie Holiday on God blessing the child. She's not nice or even all that compassionate about it. She's just strong, convinced that good feelings have to be stored up against times of trouble like everything else.

FALSE,A-,When Colors Play,Ronald Shannon Jackson,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3004,"
It's good that Jackson's avant-fusion sounds like no one else's and a little confusing that it always sounds exactly like itself, presenting the average consumer with the jazz-rock equivalent of the choice among Ricky Skaggs albums. As always, this studio-tight live set is dominated by andante unison statements of medium-complex themes that sometimes break down into vamps for counterpoint. It leans more than usual toward both small-group jazz (""Blue Midnight""'s blue saxophones) and hard fusion (""Good Omen""'s raving guitars). Skaggs's live album is one of his best, too.

""Small World,"" featuring the unison horns of Lee Rozie, Charles Brackeen, and Byard Lancaster, is the most fiercely swinging track in all avant-fusion. After that Jackson carries rhythm and melody on his kit for ten minutes as the vibes swirl around him, and then there's a haunting harmolodic blues. But overdisc it's back to eso. The title piece is OK if you can't get enough Ornette homages, but ""When We Return,"" which takes up almost a third of the record, is your basic freebie-jeebie noisemaking session, more accomplished than ""Radio Ethiopia"" but less endearing conceptually. By now, Jackson's supposed to know better.

FALSE,A-,Mandance,Ronald Shannon Jackson and the Decoding Society,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3002,"
Despite Jackson's Blood pedigree and predilection for electric plectrists, I'm hard-pressed to describe this as ""rock"" or even harmolodic funk, because while Jackson is the master of every drum rhythm from march to free time, the feel of the record is more swinging than funky, with heavy doses of Tony Williams force-beat. What it really adds up to is a fusion album on which the soloists are forced to think concisely by compositional structures that are more than cute riffs. Guitar hero: Vernon Reid, who also gets to play banjo.

He wouldn't connect without Shannon writing the tunes and swinging the funk, but the star is Vernon Reid, especially on straight Les Paul--he articulates with so much more delicacy and incisiveness than the perfectly suitable horn players, who often serve as his scrim. On Stratocaster he's power-packed. On guitar synth he's fusion or wah-wah. On banjo he sets down and thinks for a spell. On steel guitar he sounds like he's playing something else. And on ""Say What You Will"" he writes the tune himself, reminding us who's the leader.

Although she wasn't quite Nick Tosches' ""greatest menstruating rock 'n' roll singer the world has ever known""--check the Chantels, or the redundant originals and unoriginal covers on Wanda's Charly 32-track--she did leave more than nine hormonal epiphanies. Why no ""Who Shot Sam,"" no ""I Gotta Know,"" no (pthhh, wah, neeny-neeny-ni) ""Tongue Tied""? To give country purists their due, I guess: her evolution through rockaballads toward the spunky c&amp;w morality of ""My Big Iron Skillet"" and ""A Girl Don't Have To Drink To Have Fun"" is archetypal. And her Betty Hutton rip makes ""You Don't Own Me"" sound stingy. Hot dog, she made him mad.

This justly renowned tenor-sax honker's first tracks as a leader are generic music by somebody who happens to be inventing the genre. Having literally made his name on Cootie Williams's ""Gator Tail"" in 1949, he recorded all over the place before he died in 1987, but back in 1950 Apollo elected to withhold some of his wilder three-minute rides, including the incendiary ""Blow, Jackson Blow.""

I wish they were on the same side along with the second-line fast ones so the hits could just keep on coming, you know? Admittedly, the boys do have a cute, astute way with a ballad, too.

This three-song skyrocket of an EP begins with the opener and closer of the pained, poetic album it renders a luxury instead of proving a necessity. With a reformed Blood Brother shrieking his mad visions like Kathleen Hanna on Halloween and a Pretty Girls Make Graves guy overseeing the hooky noise-punk, it's like riot grrrl turned into a style after its surprise factor played out. The non-album track shouldn't have been. It's about one Townes Van Zandt fan ditching another in a Spanish train station after the ditchee tells him he's knocked her up.

Here we find an English hard-rock trio who wear short hair and dark suits, say ""fuck"" a lot, and sound rather like The Who Sing My Generation, even mentioning James Brown in one song. They also claim a positive social attitude--no police state in the U.K., but no anarchy either. Is this some kind of put-up job, pseudo-punk with respect for the verities? Could be, but it doesn't matter. When they complain that Uncle Jimmy the ""red balloon"" (or is it ""reveloo""?) never walks home at night, they've got his number, but when they accuse him of sleeping between silk sheets they're just blowing someone else's hot air. In the end, they could go either way--or both. In the meantime, though, they blow me out. These boys can put a song together; they're both powerful enough to subsume their sources and fresh enough to keep me coming back for more.

Already leading what must have been a pretty damn raucous Mississippi horn band by 1939, James is the missing link between Robert Johnson and Hound Dog Taylor. Johnson taught him, or couldn't stop him from stealing, the ""Dust My Broom"" lick he lived off of; Taylor converted his slashing simplification of Johnson's slide into something even simpler--boogie. These are the Bihari brothers-produced originals of tunes he recorded as often as he could get paid before drinking himself to cardiac arrest at 45 in 1963--not subtle, you could even say monochromatic, and they rock like nobody's business. I miss the endless despair of ""1839 Blues"" and the post-Bihari classic ""It Hurts Me Too."" But if you're so culturally deprived you can't hum ""Dust My Broom,"" here's your chance to become an addict.

The oft-bemoaned limits on her fame and fortune can't be passed off on her habit, her realness, or her distribution. Sometimes it was just that her music wasn't so hot. Between inconsistent material and workaday studio support, even her hits are a motley bunch, and crossover mentors Gabriel Mekler and Esmond Edwards never let their failure to map a plausible direction stop them from taking her for a ride. But even so, the tiger in her kittenish timbre combined formidably with her undeniable, unreliable smarts for r&amp;b as seminal as ""In the Basement,"" ""Sunday Kind of Love,"" and ""I'd Rather Go Blind."" And Esther Phillips was the only peer to take so naturally to the likes of ""One for My Baby"" and ""Prisoner of Love.""

FALSE,A-,Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday,Etta James,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1206,"
Holiday is a great American artist, a genius whose musical improvisations only deepened an unfathomable persona that was sweet, willing, knowing, suspicious, sly, cynical, and impossibly unhappy before she hit 25 and then gained texture as her body broke down. James is merely a fine r&amp;b singer who's been stroking her cult since before she had one. Entertaining an audience of self-anointed sophisticates who had a thing for earthy music, she fell into the habit of cutting her own earthiness with a flattering wink and coasting from there, and as she herself would tell you, preferably while signing your CD booklet, it would be stupid to buy this before taking on Holiday--Columbia's young three-disc box (with Billie, crappy material just adds to the challenge), or Verve's mature two-disc set (with Billie, a ravaged voice ditto). But short of Chess's young two-disc Essential Etta James, it's Etta's most consistent and musical album--her melodic nuances are every bit as hip as the ace backup of Cedar Walton's tight septet. Beyond repertoire, it has little to do with Billie--at most, Etta suggests Holiday's tough soul the way Diana Ross did her pop smarts. But compared to Miki Howard's disgracefully self-aggrandizing ""tribute"" or Terence Blanchard's dismayingly schmaltzy ""songbook,"" it's an act of love. It's also a hell of a torch record.

Churning out an album a year as she advances on 65, James has actually gotten better, settling into her iconicity more confidently than, for instance, Buddy Guy. Next to Aretha, she's the greatest black woman singer of the rock era hands down. Yet rock doesn't bring out the best in her, because it tempts her to overstate, and resisting temptation has never been her gift. On this straightforward standards collection, cut like the 1994 Billie Holiday tribute Mystery Lady with Cedar Walton and friends, she takes it easy, letting the songs do the talking and leaving you to wonder whether her modest melodic variations bespeak sly musicality or weathered pipes. Both, bank on it. In 1994, the Billie shtick seemed slightly presumptuous. No more.

A hard liver, she's sounded old for a while. This is different--weary, diminished. Yet the physical and even mental diminution enriches the music. It was cool for her long-passed youngblood homeboy Johnny Watson to claim he was ""Too Tired,"" but it's cooler for James to remember that song half a century later and sing it against tempo as if she may not get all the way to 2:34. The ""Surely someone will understand me"" of Bobby Bland's failed crossover title tune resonates differently from a dying woman. It's also different for a ghetto woman born and raised to seize ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and tell Axl, ""If you got the money we got your disease."" And having eased right into Otis Redding's blissful ""Champagne and Wine,"" she then transforms his bone-tired, just-off-the-road marriage proposal ""Cigarettes and Coffee"" into an evocation of old love so calm you believe she achieved some bliss of her own, and domestic bliss at that.

With awe for the atypical Arlene Smith and respect to the late-breaking Wanda Jackson and Brenda Lee, Jamesetta Hawkins had the most physically remarkable female voice of the '50s. ""So gritty it was filthy and so sweet it was filthier than that"" is what I came up with to promote 2000's Chess Box. But on these 15 pre-Chess tracks, the first recorded when she was 15 and the last before she was 20, the grit is sometimes a gurgle in a soprano on its way down to alto, a serration in an instrument she used to cut--quite a weapon for jailbait whose flirty ways survived well into her long junkie decades. Relieved by straight novelties like ""Shortnin' Bread Rock"" and ""The Pick-Up,"" where Harold Battiste's tenor sax plays the part of the mack, the material tends boilerplate r&amp;b, and half a century later, Leiber-Stoller's ""Tears of Joy"" doesn't sound all that much craftier than Davis-Josea's ""Good Lookin'."" There's too much of the same on Flair's 25-year-old R&amp;B Dynamite, which omits ""Shortnin' Bread Rock"" and adds only the very early ""Be My Lovey Dovey"" to her A list, though it includes all the obvious keepers. I prefer this in part because it's shorter. Makes the voice easier to treasure.

There's never been any doubt that James was commercial, as they say, but this time that's a plus--when he's not rocking, which is mostly, he even comes up with some dynamite love-man bullshit. And the street simulations are convincing enough.

James is in the canon for a few wildly unprecedented guitar and piano solos captured in 1931, his only session until he was yanked from his sickbed by the folk movement 33 years later. Although the two '60s albums he cut for Vanguard were hailed by the country blues claque, they lack the charm and commitment of John Hurt's. This contemporaneous exhumation isn't brilliant either, but it has more life. A detached noninnovator by the time it was recorded, James nevertheless maintained a personal take on an enduring entertainment music, notably in a falsetto that breathed mystery and sexual magnetism. A minor moment in the tangled history of a seminal genre.

James isn't all he's cracked up to be, especially in the '60s. If the catwalking guitar line of ""I'm So Glad"" could still give Eric Clapton penis envy, his piano had lost its atonal abandon; if the song he wrote for his D.C. M.D. has God in it, ""Careless Love"" is barely filler. But always carrying the music is a tenuous falsetto that's been through a lot of bad medicine, a voice that's looked at death from both sides now and done what it could to aestheticize the terror.

Now suddenly he's got two albums out, and on this newer and less Madagascar-specific one the emphasis doesn't require punctuation marks. The first three tracks work up a drive absent from Salegy! before settling into a supple complexity that isn't above putting its point across by reprising old tunes you and I don't remember. Salegy! sounded singer-with-backup. This is a band record--a rocking band record, with two guitars and guest horns and accordion-harmonium keyb and four backup females.

Kind of heartwarming that it's still possible for a young band to rock out with palpable joy about the pleasures, terrors, and life lessons of the road--the songs of experience thing, as if the road is reality in a way their jobs in Vancouver weren't. Helps that they're a duo--decreases the mathematical likelihood of a member nutting out, increases each member's share of the measly take. Also helps that they're not actually young--around 30 is my guess. Rendering this an escape into youth rather than from it by guys old enough to realize that if they hope to make a success of their hustle they need to turn into something like professionals--tunesmiths, even.

FALSE,A-,Fervor,Jason & the Scorchers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1669,"
Crossing Gram Parsons's knowledge of sin with Joe Ely's hellbent determination to get away with it, Jason Ringenberg leads a band no one can accuse of fecklessness, dabbling, revivalism, or undue irony. The lyrics strain against their biblical poetry at times, but anyone who hopes to take a popsicle into a disco is in no immediate danger of expiring of pretentiousness. And to spice this repackage of the Praxis original, somebody came up with the perfect perfervid gesture--Blonde on Blonde-era Dylan at 180 miles per hour.

FALSE,A-,Yasimika,Jali Musa Jawara,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6262,"
A 1983 French release picked up by U.K. Oval in 1986, this is the renowned album that made Mango's 1989 Soubindoor inevitable. Though only vocalist-koramaster Jawara plays on both, the bands--each featuring balafon, two guitars, and two women singers--achieve an identical sound. Yet though I heard this one second, it grabbed me where Mango's entry rewarded my dutiful attention. Can't pin down why in the musicianship or composition, and note dutifully that Soubindoor is two songs and 15 minutes longer. Maybe I just needed a break after Soubindoor softened me up--comparison has certainly been painless. Or maybe not--I swear the emotion is higher here, the weave a quantum more intense. And of such quanta are world-music classics made.

Gram Parsons comparisons get you nowhere, but I'm not kidding--this is the obliquely songful followup the Burritos never made. Mark Olson is spared Parsons's obsessions and probably his genius. When he sings about death--there are three angels in the first four songs, two grievous though not identified as such--you suspect Gram rather than Thanatos got him thinking on the subject. But his ""Commonplace Streets"" are his own.

FALSE,A-,Reasonable Doubt,Jay-Z,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1672,"
Designed for the hip-hop cognoscenti and street aesthetes who still swear he never topped it, his self-financed debut album is richer than any outsider could have known, and benefits from everything we'vesince learned about the minor crack baron who put his money where his mouth was. You can hear him marshalling a discipline known to few rappers and many crack barons, and that asceticism undercuts the intrinsic delight of his rhymes--not once does he let go like Biggie spitting his viciously funny little ""Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle."" He's so set on proving how hard he is that his idea of a hook is the piano loop Premier runs behind the magnificent ""D'Evils."" Once he became a rap baron he could afford less austere producers.

What is it pigs like Jigga say as they spread your legs and accuse you of wanting their money? Lay back and enjoy it? Assuming you don't believe this album is great art or reparation for chattel slavery, that's the way it is with Jay-Z's power pop. His flow is fluent, sure. But his confidence reigns supreme. Likewise his hooks, whether purchased, hired, or just what he was feeling at the time, and his rhymes, whose deepest cleverness is in their apparent effortlessness. Like Star Wars or Windows 95, he unlocks the gate to a luxurious passivity that may not be good for you in the long run but does the trick at the time.

For a record consisting almost entirely of boasts about being the best, the ex-prexy's official comeback--and also, let it be noted, his inaugural project with or is it for his new corporate partner--is fairly superb. He brings it off because he is the best, because he's documented more achievements than most bigmouths, and because he holds chits for miles. Not only are chief beatmakers Timbaland and Kanye West co-equals, he's gotten A work out of them--cf. Timbo's sample-free spirals on the atypically unbraggadocious ""Venus Vs. Mars"" and the atypically staccato clap-for-'em West designs for ""A Star Is Born."" Both are buried mid-disc, just where you'd think Jay would be sneaking in the weak s---. None of that here--though you have a right to think he's coming on too strong.

FALSE,A-,4:44,Jay-Z,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17093,"
At its frequent peaks, this unusual album nails the understated mastery it's going for--the calm candor of a titan with plenty to own up to hence plenty to teach. He's so discreet you may not notice that he can still outrhyme the small fry--""fuck with me""-""cutlery""-""butlers be""-""hustlers be,"" say, all parsing as ""The Story of OJ."" But clever's not his program. From the subtle beats No I.D. builds from Sean Carter's all-time playlist, he means to pretend he's just talking to us, nowhere more than in the painfully detailed ""4:44"" a.k.a. ""I Apologize"" a.k.a. ""I suck at love."" But just as ""4:44"" resorts for no discernible reason to an ""I cut off my nose to spite my face,"" ""The Story of OJ"" is marred by a pun on ""Dumbo"" that's funny twice max and very nearly wrecked by the deplorable ""You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America?"" The answer, in case you were wondering: ""credit."" Which is an OK principle--Jay-Z isn't the only rap elder advising youngbloods to buy property instead of Lambos. But there are plenty of similar lapses on an album where ""Legacy"" celebrates his money, some of it secured by other people's artworks, rather than his art. He's teaching black capitalism, not weighing every word much less manning up and learning to love. Compared to white capitalism, I'll take it. But unlike learning to love, it has plenty of downside.

FALSE,A-,Watch the Throne,Jay Z Kanye West,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15454,"
The three minutes of silence that rope off the first 12 songs signify that those songs constitute a unity and the deluxe edition's four bonus tracks are too much. Soon, as if on signal, two matched operatic choruses take the project's regal grandiosity over the top. But nowhere else does this gorgeous show of power trigger your gag reflex; in fact, the echoing grunts and swooping oohs of the Pete Rock-produced, Curtis Mayfield-keyed 16th track would have provided a hell of a regular-album finale with no loss of unity whatsoever. The only question is whether these guys' regal glory is of any intrinsic interest to those of us who regard power as something to speak truth to, and the answer is hell yeah, because it's been forever since stars of this magnitude were also so dominant artistically. Predictably, Jay's power is more interesting than Ye's, which was funnier and sicker on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Think the patron's proximity made the protegee nervous? Think the patron figured it would? I do.

FALSE,A-,Individually Twisted,The Jazz Passengers Featuring Deborah Harry,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3670,"
A friend of Roy Nathanson since long before this band began a decade ago, I've loved the Passengers on stage, where the saxophonist kept the interactions grooving like the comic actor he also is, and found their records arty. Here the artiest track is Elvis Costello's (and bassist Brad Jones's) long-lined ""Aubergine,"" the runner-up ""Imitation of a Kiss,"" originally the pick to click on In Love, counted the Passengers' pop move in 1994 because it had lyrics. From Nathanson and Harry's slantwise opener to Blondie's loopy closer, from David Cale's mock-'40s exotica to Nathanson's jump blues homage, its pleasures are various and manifest, and if they're over the head of the average Costello completist, that's because this pop move isn't aimed at any kind of average. Starting with the girl singer, it's real musicians tweaking real sophistication into something genuinely cooler--and warmer.

FALSE,A-,Wyclef Jean Presents the Carnival Featuring Refugee Allstars,Wyclef Jean,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4211,"
From kompas to reggae, Celia Cruz to Neville Brothers, the diasporan flavors (""Jaspora,"" one title spells it, nicely kreyolizing the Greek/Jewish term) are half decoration, half concept, and less than integral either way. Like his soul brother Puff Daddy, master of the simplistic strategy with which the Fugees wrested dominance of hip hop songwriting from the moribund Death Row consortium last year, Wyclef doesn't feature the grandiose depth charges with which Wu-Tang torpedoed hip hop beatmastering well before that. He uses the sampler--augmented by the live quote, the honored guest, and now the genre excursion--like MC Hammer before him, for one-dimensional tunes on which to float his well-articulated morality tales and popwise carnivalesque. Cognoscenti may bitch that it's only r&amp;b, but r&amp;b has been the shit for half a century, and this is where it lives.

FALSE,A-,The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book,Wyclef Jean,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4212,"
Last time he merely claimed African diaspora. Here he casts his net wide enough to snare all of pop if it'll have him, as in ""Kenny Rogers-Pharoahe Monch Dub Plate,"" featuring live appearances by both luminaries, or the pot song illustrating the proposition that if hip-hop is his wife, the guitar is his mistress. He sings roughly but warmly, and makes up as many hooks as he samples, a ploy I'm glad he can afford--one more way to mix things up. His obligatory shout-outs to the hood reject thuggism as good-humoredly as his voluntary testimonial for the red-light district rejects moralism. Clef is obviously bitterer than he lets on about the respect he doesn't get. That he keeps it to himself is the essence of an appeal that tops any schoolmarm's I can think of.

FALSE,A-,King of the Country Blues,Blind Lemon Jefferson,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11457,"
In part Jefferson's prestige was a function of pop process--he made relatively accessible records for a relatively powerful company. What was revelatory about his music was its formal master, its eloquent lyrics and integral structures. In the absence of Blind Willie Johnson's big voice or Charlie Patton's emotive incorrigibility, that master does date some, especially because Jefferson was so ill-recorded, which Yazoo's best efforts can minimize but not mitigate. Also, I miss ""Black Snake Moan"" and glumly note the melodic leap that occurs when we come across the gospel number. Nevertheless, this is a document that rewards close attention with unparalleled pleasures. Making Jefferson a not atypical songpoet.

Four years is a long time between LPs; if Jeffreys sounded like a talented cult artist on Atlantic in 1973, by now he's collected so much material he sounds like the most fecund singer-songwriter since whoever. Well, save that for the next time. Meanwhile, the racial paradox is dramatized audaciously, the dreams of showbiz glory rendered with an uncommon knowing subtlety, the reggae natural-born, the voice fuller and more passionate, and the album a great buy.
"
FALSE,A-,The King of In Between,Garland Jeffreys,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15414,"
Formally, the biracial Coney Islander is a singer-songwriter in the manner of his artistic contemporary Bruce Springsteen and his college buddy Lou Reed--a singer-songwriter who needs a drummer. Jeffreys is a good guy with loyal friends who made a small name for himself in Europe but faded from view in his hometown 20 years ago. Now at 67 he beats the odds by surpassing 1973's Garland Jeffreys, 1977's Ghost Writer, and all their lesser successors. Doing right by titles like ""I'm Alive"" and ""In God's Waiting Room,"" it's another mortality album, and sure as bank fees there'll be more. But the good ones will all be different. Although in his in-between way Jeffreys was on reggae early, the only attempted skank here is a pointedly entitled economic crisis song called ""All Around the World"" that you'll wish bit down as hard as the not-dead-yet ""'Til John Lee Hooker Calls Me."" Boogieing with a quickness, Jeffreys believes ""Rock and Roll Music"" will pick you up off the floor at 64, and Dylan guitarist Larry Campbell backs up this idea throughout. But Campbell isn't on his Eurohit cover of David Essex's schlock classic ""Rock On,"" and Jeffreys rocks on all over it anyway.

Pistols comparisons are Anglocentrism--from fuzzy vocals to minimalist tunes, from hard-and-fast surface to sweet-and-chewy center, the formal coups that have made this such a sensation are pure Ramones. My favorite parts are the cheapest; when the feedback wells up over the chords in perfect pseudomelodic formation I feel as if I've been waiting to hear this music all my life. And when the fuzzy lyrics hint half-decipherably at a luxuriant doom impervious to democratic device, I worry that maybe Ian Curtis knew more than I gave him credit for.

Some of these songs are funny, the rest very funny. ""Connecticut's for F*cking"" seems self-explanatory, ""Ellen's Bicoastal"" cl*se enough; ""Happy Me"" is about falling in love on meds, ""Vampire Girls"" about sucking knowledge from your boyfriends. The jewel is the jealous fit ""Obviously""--""I don't care. I mean I think she's a skank, but whatever, I don't care.

Remember Lina Lamont in ""Singin' in the Rain""? Imagine a woman who sings the way she talks--only she can carry a tune and use her brain. Most guys consider her affected, but therapy has taught her that that voice is just part of who she is, like her insecurities, and she copes with both. Mostly in the first person, she explores characters like the compulsively obliging half-Broadway chameleon she is, even a guy once. She's manipulative in ""Back Burner Guy,"" desperate in ""I'm Around,"" over it in ""I Miss Your Arm,"" not actually over it in ""I Hope You're Happy"" post-celibate in ""Dry Spell"": ""Suddenly she feels pretty/Suddenly she feels young/Suddenly her neighbor on the co-op board is not wrong.""

Fans of Slayed?, Fanny, ""Rock and Roll Part Two,"" and Arthur Kane before he hurt his thumb should give thanks that nostalgia has finally come this far, and then check for lines around the eyes. Producers Kenny Laguna and Ritchie Cordell make the old glitter formula of readymade riffs 'n' blare sound suitable for albums, and they get plenty of help from reformed Runaway Jett, who has writing credit on four of these twelve tunes and comes on tuffer than any gurl in history.

Somehow this soundtrack to the new biodoc of the same name manages not to impinge too drastically on such previous best-ofs as 1993's Flashback, 1999's Fit to Be Tied, 2010's Greatest Hits, or the inferior 2013 comp she also called Bad Reputation. In fact, it's the most impressive of the bunch, mostly because it enlists outside help she's manifestly earned. Sure I miss ""Light of Day"" and ""Fake Friends"" and would respectfully suggest she exhume the XXX version of ""Fetish."" But what rock and roller can get too much of ""I Love Rock N Roll,"" ""Rebel Rebel,"" or ""Bad Reputation"" itself? Of the new ""Fresh Start"" earning its lead position, the Runaways' ""Cherry Bomb"" a crucial quantum louder than the Blackhearts', a ""Crimson and Clover"" born to be obliterated by its Stooges B side? Or, especially, of the three inspired guest add-ons: Bikini Kill's generation-bridging ""Rebel Girl,"" Rea's defiant anthem-in-waiting ""Feminazi,"" and--perfect--a remake of Jett's cover of the Replacements' ""Androgynous"" that puts Miley Cyrus in the same studio as Laura Jane Grace?

A career's worth of outtakes, half covers and 13 of 22 from her 1983-86 heyday, this may end up a last gasp. But her simultaneous rediscovery by Warner bigshots and angry old gurls leaves room for hope that instead it will prove a marker. And either way it's her strongest album ever, full of stuff originally judged not weak but impolitic--the censored ""Starfucker,"" the girl-loving ""Play With Me,"" ""EMI"" as ""MCA""--as well as Jett standards backed by Sex Pistols and Melle Mel and L7, soundtrack finds penned by Bruce Springsteen and Janna Allen, oldies new to me like ""Hide and Seek"" and ""She Lost You,"" oldies forever young like ""Rebel Rebel"" and ""Call Me Lightning,"" and ""Activity Grrrl,"" in which she advises her spirit children to forget the animal rights stuff and buy a set of leathers.

Won over by their yearning cover of Steely Dan's ""Hey Nineteen,"" which for once encompasses all the ironies of middle-aged acolytes singing teen music in a world whose teens are beguiled by almost middle-aged pop pros, I developed an addiction to side one, then checked out their Relic/Beltone best-of. A find, that one, not only unpretentious but fun (oh those pop impurities), and the beauty part is that on their mature album they've bettered themselves. Pitt's doowop has absorbed soul usages without getting soggy, and he writes (and rewrites) originals which neither abandon the style's romanticism nor turn it into a silly lie. Also, somebody up there knows how to pace and program an album. And isn't above fishing for hooks.

I give up--it would be as perverse to resist his razzle-dazzle as to pretend Led Zep doesn't knock your socks off. Songpoetry, rock and roll, the showtunes to come--such categories just get in his way. He's pure Tin Pan Alley, George M. Cohan if not Irving Berlin for a self-conscious, neoprimitive age, and in this high-quality context his soft early successes--""New York State of Mind,"" ""She's Always a Woman"" may the Lord forgive me, the image-making ""Piano Man""--sound like the consumer durables there can be no doubt they'll be. It's unfortunate that the confessional codes of contemporary pop put his eternal insecurity around independent females up front, but his woman problems are no worse than Bob Dylan's--or for that matter John Lennon's or Bruce Springsteen's, although he's less pious, hence stupider, about them. He's pretentious, but never pious--going for the pop jugular is all he knows. The worst you can say about him is that half the time his aim isn't perfect. And the worst you can say about this album is that he baited it with two new misses.

Balancing the unrecorded classics of the Dolls' rent-party phase--""Girls"" (""I love 'em seizin' the power""), ""Funky but Chic"" (""Mama thinks I look pretty fruity but in jeans I feel rotten""), and ""Frenchette"" (as in laundrette)--against ground-breaking love/heartbreak songs like ""Donna"" and ""Pain in My Heart,"" this is in many ways a ""better"" record than either Dolls LP. Sound quality is fuller, the rhythm section funks and flows, the guitarists play genuine solos and respond to the call, and Johansen's voice is as open and direct as his new songs, finding an almost soulful musical and emotional range. Conceptually, though, it's singer-with-backup in a post-garage mode, packing no distinctive structural or sonic kick, pretty conventional for the pied piper of outrageousness.

With the help of sideperson extraordinaire Blondie Chaplin, the pater-familias has finally mastered his own fast, vulgar studio-rock style, and this is his best solo, though only we who truly love him will hear it that way. True, the words aren't what they were in the Dolldays--""Marquesa de Sade,"" which rhymes ""girl,"" ""world,"" ""pearls,"" and ""social whirl"" with an insistence that makes me wince, is typical. But like almost every other song here, ""Marquesa de Sade"" is also hooky and hearty. If In Style sounded desperate, this one sounds past caring, and carelessness was always the Dolls' secret.

The inspired deployment of taste, always Johansen's specialty, is why his solo career has flourished live even when it's floundered on record. By kidding around with such florid models as Eric Burdon and Levi Stubbs, he can make a populist commitment that never seems cowardly, condescending, or corny--and bring off an in-concert LP (featuring six cuts he's never recorded in his present incarnation) that conveys all his good humor, deep feeling, and entertainment value.

The synbeats and keyboard colors on his first studio LP since 1980 don't flush away the corn that is his destiny, but after years of records geared to grandiose AOR-cum-band-bar guitarism, they update its context. Just in time, because--ignoring a few easy rhymes and possibly excepting ""N.Y. Doll""--his best solo album ever showcases his best songwriting since the N.Y. Dolls, including but not limited to the hedonist ""I Ain't Workin' Anymore"" (he got money), the hostile ""The Stinkin' Rich"" (they got too much money), the fast-talking ""King of Babylon"" (baby he was born to rap), and the explicit ""Heard the News"" (in solidarity with the people of El Salvador).

But on the other hand, no ""Melody,"" no ""Marquesa de Sade,"" no ""Flamingo Road,"" no enjoyable-to-forgivable gestures that aged even more awkwardly than the rest of his Grass Roots phase.

Fortunately, Johnson didn't therefore go reinvent the wheel, mostly because he's got no minimalism in him--his sound and his backdrops are bigger and hotter than his predecessors'.

Most likely the smattering of albums by the Nashville pro who came up with ""I Fall to Pieces"" and ""Make the World Go Away"" deserves one of those Rhino cherrypicks of yore. But there's a reason he had more success as a songwriter than a singer, and this collection of 15 duets and a solo showcase makes a nice alternative. Although it may omit other semi-classics as well-turned as (""If she's anything like her memory . . ."") ""She'll Be Back"" and (jukebox not route number) ""A-11,"" both new ones on me, I actively miss only ""She's Got You"" and ""It Ain't Love, but It Ain't Bad."" And vocally, duet partners from 41-year-old Alison Krauss to 86-year-old Ray Price outdo themselves keeping the young powerhouse in check--only on the ill-advised showcase does Johnson get to show off.

Politics aside, Johnson has fresh musical gifts--an inside-outside awareness of the inherent musicality of Caribbean English and a rhythmic touch as uncanny as his band's. On this album they're enhanced by insinuating horn charts, even melodies. While some prefer his debut, the bloody Dread Beat an' Blood (Virgin Front Line import), for striking closer to the broken bone of British racism, I actually like the abstractions here better, especially on ""Reality Poem.""

His voice quieter but undiminished, his band subtler but no less tricky or effective, he unblushingly repeats five songs from the 1985 set, and although I wish he'd tapped Tings an' Times more--""Sense Outa Nansense,"" certainly--I sure didn't mind hearing the early material again.

All three formed duos; occasionally they even ganged up into a trio I'd love to hear. But on the basis of the records I know I'll just note that the hierarchy was designed for jazzbos. Especially on this mostly solo Hot Club of Paris session, but also on Delmark's small-combo Central Avenue Boogie, Johnson is the barrelhouse piano player of rock and roll dreams--he plays more fast ones and flexes more right-hand muscle. So I prefer him straight up--sidemen just get in his way.

When Billboard wondered whether Freedy could fill one of those solo-male chart niches left inexplicably vacant by Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams, the object of their affections had the artistic integrity to keep a straight face about it. He's a cardplayer--so committed to the mystery of the ordinary that you have to poke a stick beneath his placid, bland catchiness to glimpse the empathy and compulsion it conceals. With '70s studio hero Danny Kortchmar replacing the mismatched Butch Vig behind the board, Johnston not only regains his grace but spells it out--most of these lyrics tell a story suitable for paraphrasing. But he'll never be accessible to consumers who can only read a heart when it's bloodying a sleeve. Our blessing, his curse.

John Lennon gets to unveil a throwaway like ""Oh Yoko"" as the stroke it is. But can an unknown risk such a thing? Not if he craves respect. As it turns out, there are several such strokes among these demos, all preceding or circa 1989's overworked The Trouble Tree and 1992's fine-tuned Can You Fly. Johnston would never put the multi-tracked talkathon ""Happy Birthday"" or the folkie rave-up ""Friend in the City"" on a real album, but both achieve a fun his real albums avoid with no sacrifice in ambivalence or bite. And then there are great lost outtakes like ""I Do, I Do,"" in which the excited suitor awaiting the delivery of his mail-order bride croons, ""I'm the guy you're belonging to""--not, for instance, ""I'm the guy you're longing for."" Get somebody else to splice on the guitar-bass-drums and that would be a Can You Fly bonus track to remember.

It's hard now to grasp that, generation gap aside, this native of Lithuania was nothing less than the Elvis of the first half of the 20th century. But fame was fleeting in that trendy, technology-driven era, and by the mid-'30s, as foolish kids and fickle oldsters embraced the big-band fad and ""crooning"" style, ""The World's Greatest Entertainer"" was slipping badly. While it's true enough that his emotionality was too cornball for an emerging generation of pseudosophisticates, the biggest problem was his resistance to new media--his radio shows were spotty, and much worse for history, his studio recordings were stiff. As anyone who screens The Jazz Singer learns, however, movies were the exception. Hollywood let him roll his eyes and shake his fanny in front of onlookers who could feed him the approval he craved. Whether he's wearing burnt cork or pancake makeup, appropriating Irving Berlin or an Oedipal kiss from his mammy, his verve, spontaneity, and sexual magnetism are as startling as, well, Elvis's.

Although it sticks too close to heart songs, this comeback-to-basics statement is the best country album of the year and far surpasses the rest of Jones's recent work. I'm getting to like the over-forty Jones as much as the rawboned honky-tonker anyway--what's amazing about him is that by refusing the release of honky-tonking he holds all that pain in, audibly. The result, expressed in one homely extended metaphor per song (the only one that's too commonplace is ""diary of my life""), is a sense of constriction that says as much about the spiritual locus of country music as anything I've heard in quite a while.

This collection of ten collaborations with outlaw old-timers, country-rock phenoms, Staples, Tammy, and someone named Elvis has low points, as you might expect. But its quality has more to do with what's being sung than with who's singing it where. James Taylor, harmonizing from New York on his neo-classic ""Bartender's Blues,"" sounds fine; Emmylou Harris, chiming in from El Lay on the lame ""Here We Are,"" fares only slightly worse than Johnny Paycheck does on poor old ""Proud Mary,"" which comes complete with made-in-Nashville interaction. Must-hears: ""I Gotta Get Drunk,"" with Willie Nelson, and the amazing ""Stranger in the House,"" which gives an unexpected clue about who taught Mr. Costello to sing.

Smiling corpse or committed cuckold or drunk peering over the edge of the wagon, a sinner is what he am, and he's never sounded so abject or unregenerate--the twenty-years-in-five thickness of his Epic voice only intensifies the effect.

Sure he's inconsistent and self-destructive, but he's such a natural that all his insanity goes into the mix, and such a pro that the greatest performance on all four sides, ""He Stopped Loving Her Today,"" was recorded with a year between the first verse and the bridge. Note also that it was completed in 1980--the strictly chronological sequencing clarifies how he and Billy Sherrill grew into their collaboration. As countrypolitan evolves into country-pop, yielding a standard country best-of on the first two sides, Sherrill gives up on forcing Jones into the mold, instead encouraging his prize to be what he is, the greatest country singer in history--not so much with arrangements, though they do get sparer, as with increasingly hyperbolic and goofy material. Jones's Starday and Musicor best-ofs are as essential as Jimmie Rodgers or Robert Johnson. Side four--ruminative, mannered, dripping with pain--cuts them.

You never know with George. On Starday's 16 Greatest Hits, which I purchased for $3.88 in 1978, are Jones originals called ""Eskimo Pie"" and ""No Money in This Deal"" that I've always loved. Now I check Joel Whitburn and discover that neither was ever a hit, great or otherwise. These were--they constitute as complete a tour of Jones's early best-sellers as has ever been conducted. That doesn't make ""Tender Years"" half the record ""No Money in This Deal"" is--Nashville hits are often cornier than city folks prefer. But he isn't the greatest country singer in history for nothing. Let a dozen compilations bloom. Just watch out for duplications.

The cassette-bound are advised to fast-forward to side two, CD investers to program, oh, 6-4-7-8-9-10-1; there's no true filler here, but ""Wrong's What I Do Best"" is far more thematic than ""I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair,"" in which 10 suburban cowpeople sing the praises of 61-year-old youth, and which I conceive as a coda. George has been hitched and on the wagon since well before he cut his late-'80s dreck, but he can still sing the likes of ""Drive Me To Drink"" (if she can't be his wife she can be his chauffeur) and ""There's the Door"" (if she can walk out of the house maybe he can walk out of the bar) as if he does a lot of listening at 12-step meetings. His problem wasn't authenticity--it was Billy Sherrill.

Be they literal rereleases like New Favorites and The Race Is On or circumscribed compilations like Razor &amp; Tie's UA-only She Thinks I Still Care, they rise and fall with the quirks of a taste that isn't yours. But here partnership is a steadying influence, as Montgomery props up the flatter material with her cornpone contralto. George isn't just being polite when he claims Melba was a better match than Tammy--anyone who counts that Birmingham beautician deep country should check out the hollers near Iron City, Tennessee. Montgomery is less original than Jones, as is Pavarotti. But she's so downhome that she never got her druthers or her just deserts. And she's also so downhome that Pappy Daily didn't even think about countrypolitanizing her.

If rock and roll plunges forward like young love, then country music partakes of the passionate stability of a good marriage, and here's one couple who know for damn sure that the wedding doesn't end the story. Their hits are alternately tender and recriminatory, funny and fucked up, but they're always felt and they're always interesting. And even though George and Tammy eventually succumbed to d-i-v-o-r-c-e, they don't give you the feeling that that's the way it has to come out.

Suggesting both Dusty Springfield's breathy yearning and Karen Carpenter's AM plainstyle, Jones is a Bonnie Ronstadt for the local-band era--a nonwriter ready to raid the enormous store of good songs only pop cultists have ever heard. Of course, in the CHR era her audience may never get beyond pop cultists, which would be doubly unjust: it's bad enough when a dB's album leads off with two Peter Holsapple sure shots and stiffs, but this record leads off with two Peter Holsapple sure shots and then goes on to mine Richard Barone, Elvis Costello, even producer-svengali Don Dixon. And topping them all is a loony vow of romantic devotion called ""Follow You All Over the World,"" by one B. Simpson. Wonder how many more B. Simpsons have hidden such stuff away on their demo cassettes. (Please do not mail tapes to The Voice; Donald Dixon c/o A&amp;M Records, 595 Madison Avenue, will do fine.)

Everyone who called Janis Joplin a great blues singer was wrong. She was, and is, a great rock singer. She needed Big Brother more than any of us knew, not just for image, but musically, and not as a complement but a parallel--their crudeness defined her own. Janis has been struggling to shake off that crudeness, and while this record doesn't quite do what she has in the past for most of us, it is a surprisingly strong try, with a lot of help from producer Gabriel Mekler. Anyone who has given up on Janis along the way ought to try again. She's coming on.

Nevertheless, they and their soul/blues do her a disservice. I miss Big Brother, whose bizarre lumpenhippie ""acid rock,"" when combined with her too frequently ignored country roots and her blues allegiances, made for an underclass triple-header altogether too threatening and unkempt to suit the kind of professional advisors who help singers assemble backup bands. No accident that the only transcendent tracks here are ""Me and Bobby McGee,"" an country song, and ""Mercedes Benz,"" an impromptu (or simulated impromptu) hippie goof.

It's the usual overstatement to call him the Jimi Hendrix of Tex-Mex--though I don't doubt he's the finest improvisor in his idiom, Jimi cuts him deeper than the assailant who took two years out of Jordan's career in a New Mexico bar in 1973.

With Ian Curtis having hanged himself from the apex of a love triangle well before this 1979 U.K. debut came out in the States, it's hard to pass off his depressiveness as affectation even though critiques of his sincere feelings are definitely in order: the man is idolizing as fast as he oxidizes, a role model as dubious as Sid or Jimbo for the inner-directed set. Nevertheless, it's his passionate gravity that makes the clumsy, disquieting music so convincing--not just a songwriting stroke like ""She's Lost Control"" but gothic atmosphere like ""Candidate"" and ""I Remember Nothing.""

Le Tigre had a sisterly ebullience sometimes, and on her 2013 Julie Ruin comeback she sounded so glad to be alive everything else was secondary. But here she's grrrlish once again, proudly indulging her inner brat as she and her crack electropunk band launch putdown after empowering putdown at a fearsome dad, a pickup creep, a bullshitting promoter, a pushy fan, a pushier friend, a troll, and assorted conversationalists. Since the most painful and effective of these seems to implore a lifemate ""Let Me Go,"" it's a relief when the enigmatic finale wonders quietly what made her think she could fly and then thanks the unspecified person who gave her the courage to try.

Crew name turns an insult around while permitting some light pan-Africanism, a Melle Mel hook, and the simple point that anywhere people get killed for the color of their skin is a jungle for sure. Samples come every which way--here Mingus, there Farfisa-cum-Hammond-B3, and over there drumbeats so offhand I'd half swear they were live. And reinforcing their professions of solidarity is the fact that they hardly boast at all--unless you're afraid claims that their jimbrowskis are seven feet tall will be taken literally by their tragically ill-informed audience.

From falsetto-Afrochant-over-hummed-beat to Middle-Eastern-popsong-with-show-jazz-brass, his music seems ecstatic even before you know his border-crossing backstory.

This Carolina-based union organizer--who dedicates his second album to his father, Rabbi Benjamin M. Kahn--is the most gifted songwriter to come out of the folkie tradition since John Prine. His overview is political and his songs personal, their overriding theme the emotional dislocations of working far form home. No doubt part of his secret is that he lives among folk rather than folkies, but his understated colloquial precision is sheer talent. Some will consider the all-acoustic music thin (it's often solo or duet, twice a cappella) and the voice quavery. I find that both evoke the mountain music of the '20s in a way that makes me long for home myself, and I'm from Queens.

Pomo folklorists Henry Kaiser and David Lindley stick their fretboards into these 18 Malagasy songs at will because despite their thing for Madagascar's isolation (you'd never guess from title or music that hundreds of thousands of strikers filled the capital's streets during their two-week visit), they understand that this Indian Ocean island is as multicultural as it gets--an Asian/Malaysian/Polynesian part of Africa that's been fucked over by Europe like everywhere else. The 13 artists represent a profusion of mostly commercialized styles, yet between their euphonious language and the indigenous timbres of their lutes and flutes, they blend gracefully together. Fittingly, the gentle Japanese pop tune the foreigners feed them melds better than ""I Fought the Law."" From lullaby to jamboree, melody is clearly treasured in this place.

Much commoner were references to ye olde Sonic Youth, whom they resemble somewhat less than they do the Go-Go's. Guess indie rock is wasted on the young, because Liliput is the analogy even if Nikki Colk has never heard of them either. Kaito are noisier, faster, girlier; Colk mispronounces her English not as a Marlene Marder homage but so people will think she's from Sweden. But the two share a rare, rambunctious sense that noise is fun and life is livable, a tremendous relief in a time when so many new guitar bands never hint at their reason for existing. Eventually Kaito might get full of themselves like Bis. Or they might cover ""Ain't You."" Not both.

Collectorama in extremis: seven-track, 35-minute album recorded circa 1993 in Toronto by Ghanaian emigre Yaw Atta-Owuso and then mastered back home where costs were cheaper. Some 50 cassettes were manufactured. of which an estimated three were sold. The only playable one known to survive was purchased from a Ghanaian roadside vendor in 2002 by Brian Shimkovitz, who began Awesome Tapes From Africa so he could release it. And Shimkovitz obviously has better ears than most collectors, because his pet rarity is infectious, charming, and idiosyncratically stripped-down. Credit not its preset beats but the bright tune sense and chipper singing and rapping of Atta-Owuso and the female chorus he had the sense to enlist. Atta-Owuso had no inkling that hiplife tyros in Accra were doing something similar--his Westernized Afropop is pure self-expression. Because no one heard it but his posse, it says nothing about the cultures that produced it but a lot about the musician who felt compelled to put it on tape--a lively, focused, friendly guy unlike any other you can bring to mind.

Neither his beats nor his flow are as musical as Cube's, and there's no line as killer as ""Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA.""

Maybe those who find Afropop too ethnic will appreciate the confident compromises of this Guinean griot turned Malian pop star turned Parisian bandleader. Unlike his rival Salif Keita, he considers dance music his mission--even the title song, a romantic showcase for his flawless tenor, maintains a groove. Not out of hopes for world peace did his hyped-up arrangement of the traditional ""Yï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"" become a giant single in Europe last year--his mix of brass, synths, polyrhythm, and kora is a typically hokey Eurodisco alignment.

For a while I thought the only thing Capitol had done right was sign them, but between the exuberant Katrina Leskanich and the surefire Kimberley Rew this band would be hard for any label to fuck up: not one of the twenty songs on the band's two Attic LPs--Walking on Sunshine and 2, both recommended as Canadian imports--is a loser. U.S. producer Scott Litt's tricky new version of ""Machine Gun Smith"" makes up for the Motown horns he adds to ""Walking on Sunshine."" The hyped-up drums of his rather glaring remix don't really hurt anything. And if his selections favor Rew's conventional side, well, after earning his art badge with the Soft Boys the composer is working fulltime for Katrina, and hence making a specialty of direct expression in any case.

On his first album with Keita, Nicolas Repac distinguished himself from her original svengali--Marc Minelli, who eased her into a loungey Euro-Africana whose acuity and integrity defied all odds--by balancing canny synth inventions with a wealth of Malian instruments and voices. Its charm, which in retrospect helps explain Minelli's success as well--and which eludes analysis because the grooves and melodic contours are so un-American--is the uncanny way Keita's own voice recalls the young Billie Holiday's plush, unpushy croon. The effect is about sound, not meaning--far from suggesting Holiday's irony or humor, the unrhymed summations the package provides are long on Afro-homilies, though the straightforward adoption advice and disdain for clueless elders have a sharpness to them. But after half a century of hopeless Holiday imitators, the physical fact is exceptionally seductive--and clearly not an imitation at all.

So the straightforward rhythms mesh imperceptibly with the traditional instruments Keita is forever rediscovering, and though it's not clear from the credits whether such Bamako big men as Toumani Diabate (kora) and Ousmane Kouyate (guitar) ever occupied the same room as such New York delegates as John Medeski (organ) and Henry Schroy (essential on bass), their spiritual confluence is in the grooves. Above it all Keita soars gravely in Bambara and sometimes English, his sand-blasted yearning finally kept in focus by a production that knows the difference between embellishing and bedizening.

The auteur is Lebanese oud maestro Marcel Khalife, the ensemble his son Rami on piano, his son Bachar on percussion, and Jilbert Yamine on the harplike qanun. Conceptually, this quiet, emotional, sometimes lively, always intense, nonetheless calming music is said to fuse two things: first, the same longing for physical love--not mere sex, eros--you get in Omar Souleyman's macho dance workouts, and second, an intellectual nostalgia for the pre-Columbian Andalusian accord, where Jews, Christians, and of course Muslims lived together in harmony in the south pain, supposedly.

Certainly no one in rock or musical comedy maintains such a consistent level of lyrical sophistication, even if he does overdo the brittle satire at times like these (which may be because brother Stoney is helping out again). And those who would bewail his relationship to the great European harmonic tradition should remember that Cole Porter was a rhumba man and ponder the title of Andy Hernandez's attack on white-collar crime: ""Dowopsalsaboprock.""

FALSE,A-,"I, Too, Have Seen the Woods",Kid Creole and the Coconuts,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1923,"
Mr. Softee isn't the type, but somehow August Darnell has turned into Old Faithful. Mortality impinges attractively on this typically elegant and literate dance album, which few will dance to and enough buy--especially in Europe, where they think he's Josephine Baker. If you've never gotten him, chances are you're stuck with your deaf spot. Otherwise, get it.

Although he claims he's set ""to leave his beloved Isle of York once and for all,"" Manhattan toned up the Kid's politics. The Cory Daye feature ""Consequently,"" which starts with Columbus sailing the ocean blue, is as cold-eyed as the Mekons' Sally Timms feature ""Brutal,"" and ""Oh Marie"" and ""Madison Avenue"" are more realistic about crime in the streets and crisis in the schools than most rap or any Lou Reed. As for the love songs, they're fine when love has nothing to do with it--when he's hot for a party girl, or insisting a sex object meet his plastic surgeon.

FALSE,A-,12 Bit Blues,Kid Koala,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15797,"
The turntablist prankster has set himself up to fail here, which he may think is blues and I don't, just as he may think blues recordings should be rough stuff in the Alan Lomax mode whereas I think they're better served sonically by Leonard Chess. Anyway, nobody who knows blues as well as I do, which is medium well at best, is also going to know enough about turntablist technology to truly understand what it means to eschew sequencing software in cobbling together bits and pieces of a blues album on a classic and therefore long outmoded E-mu SP-1200 sampler. Too crude not just for Muddy Waters but for one of those also-rans the Revenant and Yazoo folk sneak into their secret histories, the songs Koala fabricates are songs in form only. Yet this isn't to deny their tunes or even hooks, nor to deny they're blues. After more time than anyone from either camp will be inclined to give it, the album takes on a compelling, sui generis sonic identity, at least for someone from the blues side. What the turntablist side might think I am unqualified to guess.

Wish this ""illegitimate son of man"" would stop pretending he's a pimp--he tours so much he can't possibly provide the necessary continuity. But not since great Motï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""I don't like small cars or real big women/But somehow I always find myself in 'em."" Belatedly fulfilling the rap-metal promise of Licensed To Ill, he makes the competition sound clownish, limp, and corny, respectively, and the Eminem cameo is a draw--his flow is surer even if his sound isn't. Lickin' pussy underwater blowin' bubbles up your ass, he is, and I quote, all of that and a bag of chips.

Departed non-drum machine Steve Goulding rock-'n'-rolls away and Gary Lucas signifies untoward virtuosity with his guitar as Jon Langford hectors, derogates, prophesies, and propagandizes. Sure hope ""It's Happening Again"" is the best song about the return of fascism I ever hear.

Outgrowing art-garage blues worship, they cop tunes, big up their sound, and spank basic rock beats. As vision, still somewhere between narrow and ignant. Yet not a boho archetype for nothing.

FALSE,A-,In Session,Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=48,"
About a year later, in October 1984, Vaughan would throw a birthday party at Carnegie Hall with his brother Jimmy, Dr. John, and the Roomful of Blues horns. This was just a Canadian TV taping with the stalwart bluesman, who barely remembered jamming with the skinny young kid in Austin years before. With Vaughan dead (oh right, King too), both these events are now CD-available for keepsake-hungry fans. Rockers always overrated Albert King, whose broad aesthetic was longer on power than definition, but here his presence has a quieting effect on his disciple, who in the end did far more with a closely related aesthetic. And since King is the putative star, we get his repertoire, a big problem with the endless Vaughan reissue program, and his singing, which is stronger than Stevie's. So to my surprise, this is the one to wear around your neck.

In between B.B. socks home old hits as familiar as ""Sweet Sixteen"" and as worthy as ""Darlin' You Know I Love You"" with a tough intensity he rarely brings to the studio. I prefer the horn arrangements on the Kent originals, but the unpredictable grit with which he snaps off the guitar parts makes up for any lost subtlety.

FALSE,A-,The Best of B.B. King,B.B. King,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=245,"
King is human and then some--never less than intelligent but often less than inspired, especially with words. So I'm delighted at how many high points this captures--""Caldonia"" and ""Ain't Nobody Home"" from London. ""Nobody Loves Me but My Mother"" (marred by unfortunate engineering tricks) from Indianola, two classic blues, and ""The Thrill Is Gone,"" one of his greatest ballads. And though I still find ""Why I Sing the Blues"" self-serving and ""Hummingbird"" silly, they sure make classy filler.

FALSE,A-,Tapestry,Carole King,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=549,"
Pacific rock, sure, but with a sharpness worthy of a Brooklyn girl--if there's a truer song about breaking up than ""It's Too Late,"" the world (or at least AM radio) isn't ready for it. Not that lyrics are the point on an album whose title cut compares life to a you-know-what--the point is a woman singing. King has done for the female voice what countless singer-composers achieved years ago for the male: liberated it from technical decorum. She insists on being heard as she is--not raunchy and hot-to-trot or sweet and be-yoo-ti-ful, just human, with all the cracks and imperfections that implies. And for the first time she has found the music--not just the melodies, but the studio support--to put her point across as cleanly and subtly as it deserves.

Grand, powerful, grating, and surprisingly lyrical, with words that cast aspersions on NYC (violence you know) and make me like it, or at least not hate it (virtually a first for the Crims), this does for classical-rock fusion what John McLaughlin's Devotion did for jazz-rock fusion. The secret as usual is that Robert Fripp is playing more--he does remind me of McLaughlin, too, though he prefers to glide where McLaughlin beats his wings. In compensation, Bill Bruford supplies more action than Buddy Miles. Less soul, though--which is why the jazz-rock fusion is more exciting.

John S. Hall wants you to believe he'll be cracking wise when the world ends, an event he once projected for 1992 or 1993, although now that he's on a major he's trying to push the date back. About time, I say--the major, I mean. Hall is completely word-dependent--when his imagination flags second half, so does the album. But it isn't just the consistency of the sarcasm that distinguishes this one. It's the way he's putting his hard-rock comedy, shaggy dog fables, and sophistical shit across. Rarely has a performance artist made a more forceful adjustment to guitar-bass-and-drums, or a college-radio band a tuffer adjustment to clean-yet-heavy. Credit indie engineer Lou Giordano for his postindie production, and Atlantic for its venture capital.

It says something about the limitations of the Kinks' professional renaissance that this belated compilation of B sides and outtakes, most of them recorded pre-renaissance, at around the time of Village Green Preservation Society, stands as the group's best album of the decade. Fragile, unkempt, whimsical, sometimes thrown away, with brother Dave left room for a cinematic fantasy of his own, it sticks close to the harmless eccentrics who comprise the only socially significant subculture about which Ray has ever had anything interesting to say.

FALSE,A-,Just Between You and Me,The Kinleys,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3679,"
So womanly they seem almost kinky, harmonizing twin sisters explore a range of Nashville life choices--crazy in love or desperate to get back there, lazing around or sleeping around or pondering separations that put mere breaking up in existential perspective. Sound pretty relevant to me. Young or old, married or single, straight or gay, janitor or schoolteacher or constitutional lawyer or championship computer nerd, most people I meet lead emotional lives like these, and the songs get stronger as they go along. In ""Contradictions"" two mothers let their kids go and the first kid is older than the second mother. Then they go out on ""Dance in the Boat,"" which rocks same.

Atypically, she was just starting a learning curve when haha i'm sorry got her the online attention she craves and braves. She raps better now, shaping her breathy little-girl pout into vulnerability and defiance as circumstances dictate, which often means simultaneously. She rhymes better too, parting ways with fellow K-holes Kreayshawn and Ke$ha by flaunting disgusting conditions unlikely to innarest the audience that licks its chops over barely-legal porn-lite. Which isn't to say she can't brag, or command the beats and collabs to match. This is one of those artists fans worry about--she has not only talent but heart, and too many insecurities.

FALSE,A-,Jews With Horns,The Klezmatics,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3681,"
If I was a maven, maybe the hodgepodge of influences would grate, but more likely they'd just delight more. Conceptually, the pleasure here is how subtly a free and easy universalism animates a style that's often provincial on purpose and sometimes culture-bound in spite of itself. And musically, it's how unassumingly these folks show off their endless chops. That goes even for the wonderful singer Lorin Sklamberg, who never betrays the slightest emotional or physical strain even though he's as transcendent a tenor as today's semipop can offer--and for my second favorite, violinist Alicia Svigals, and for avant-clarinetist David Krakauer, and Miles-inflected Frank London, and loose-limbed David Licht, and no doubt bassist-vocalist Paul Morrissett too. This is a wedding music for listeners of every sexual persuasion. Its object is joy. Its miracle is that they come by the joy honestly.
"
FALSE,A-,Possessed,The Klezmatics,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3682,"
Modern klezmer obviously celebrates Jewish roots and identity--often mixed in with Jewish eclecticism, usually with Jewish secularism, occasionally with Jewish avant-gardism, and always with Jewish celebration itself. The Klezmatics assume all that and then intensify the Jewishness as they transcend and/or escape it. Lorin Sklamberg's ethereal yet sensual tenor epitomizes sacramental seriousness while suggesting the slippery skepticism of all traveling musicians, and the rest of the Klezmatics make congruent artistic choices--as in the ""Reefer Song"" Frank London composed with Yiddish lyrics by Michael Wax, or the bewitchingly traditional melody Alicia Svigals provided lyricist Tony Kushner's bereftly postmodern ""An Undoing World."" Anchored and turned inside out by that song, the first half of this record reaches Jewish heaven--where the undone are restored, where the Messiah gathers the gays and blacks and reefer-smokers to his bosom, where the just feast on a ""fabulous and tasty wild ox"" called the Shor-a-bor. This is a vision band with a genre, not a genre band with a vision. And both are open to all.

Their first true album in six years would have arrived in 2002 if the release date had survived whatever squabbles delayed it. But with only violinist Alicia Svigals gone her own way, blame the mood shift on history rather than personality--lots of slow ones to go with lots of grief. Leaning on the mournful Eastern European modalities the shtetl assimilated long ago--check especially the Matt Darriau threnody and Frank London prayer--the Klezmatics conjure an album as soaked in 9/11 as The Rising, whose similar title is no coincidence. But this doesn't mean they jettison the jazz passages and upful wedding tunes. The marriage of heaven and hell, Blake called it.

Recorded in 2006, this concert program performs roughly the same function as Piranha's 2008 cherrypick Tuml = Lebn. But personally, I'd rather hear these New Yorkers trying out their English than honoring tradition on a German best-of boasting ""7 songs in Yiddish, 1 song in Yiddish/English + 8 instrumentals."" Thus I gravitated to the four Woody Guthries and one Holly Near on the second disc, wished Susan McKeown would join the band already, welcomed cameo-ready Joshua Nelson, and was perfectly fine when half the Tuml = Lebn songs showed up. And then in a contemplative mood I sat still and listened to the first disc's 12-minute, quarter Yiddish, quarter English, half instrumental ""Dybbuk Suite."" Understood every note, I swear.

Whereupon follows a famous sample from the MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"" and a welter of pop-industrial body grooves. These voracious smarty-pants Brits--a/k/a the Timelords, the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, the Jams--are sampling less and copycatting more these days, and whatever they mean or don't mean, deconstruct or reify or exploit, they like everything I like about house and are canny enough to can the boring parts.

The rare great lost album that justifies its legend, this was held back by Elektra in 1993, supposedly due to the lynching cartoon on the cover, although the fading sales of conscious hip hop and the death by automobile of 20-year-old D.J. SubRoc couldn't have helped. Not quite great, maybe; slightly dated, even. But it moves more confidently than 1991's Mr. Hood, and confident movement freshens the St. Ides and Somalia references decisively. Right or wrong, the crew's two founding brothers are exhilarated by their belief that hip hop can persuade the youth to watch out for cancer sticks and nibble plum pudenda, by their mastery of a sonic layering that assumes the Bomb Squad and has fun with it, by bass player B. Thompson. Of course, they're also exhilarated by each other, and that wasn't gonna last. But make a face at Elektra anyway.

What makes K'naan's hip-hop Somalian is less the authenticating stories he tells than the atmospheric samples he claims--after a snatch of Marley ska, the borrowed stuff is all Buda Musique swing from up Addis Ababa way. But lest you think him a do-gooders' rehab project like Emmanuel Jal or Sierra Leone's Refugee All-Stars, be hereby informed that when this ambitious and optimistic fellow talks ""song hook,"" he knows whereof he speaks--just as he does when he rhymes in the English he learned as a teenager, though I hope he outgrows ""Somalia""'s -ation rhymes. Chubb Rock and Mos Def cameos are about it for his hip-hop cred, but Damian Marley-Adam Levine-Kirk Hammett is a pretty good pass at pop cred. Not that they guarantee sales. But after what K'naan has been through, bless him for trying--the ebullience he extracts from a life much tougher than North Americans can know is worthy of soukous, mbaqanga, the highlife of Ghana's most punishing inflationary spiral. Spiritually Afropop, rhythmically Ameripop--instead of hip-hop, maybe we should call it rap. He likes the word fine himself.

Celebrating the lighter side of alienation, the cunning Olof Dreijer elbows comely synthesizer tunelets with sharp synthesizer beatlets as his wacky sister Karin applies a kiddie screech to various bad things. Exactly what these are is hard to say because the lyrics resist parsing as sound and sense.

This being Nashville, of course they claim his secret is reality, but I say it's literature. He's a writer pure and simple, schooled in the economical everyday; if he'd grown up in California instead of Kentucky, he'd have tried his hand at sitcoms. I love the way he finds a pungent trope and tops it--drives his truck to Timbuktu and then lies down on a bed of nails. The music is spare enough to signify reality, and big enough to heighten it.

Oddly, this Brussels-recorded ""mini-album"" lasts six minutes longer than 2004's presumably full-length Kinshasa-recorded debut and repeats only two of its songs. Not that songs mean much with such a sound- and rhythm-driven crew--certainly less than the professionalism they've gained since Vincent Kenis lured them from obscurity or retirement early in the decade. Stepped-up force, drive and pace render it the most intense of the three extant Congosonics showcases--the one I'll play when I crave their paleo-futurist fusion of village dance-trance and hand-crafted electronic distortion. The limits of that fusion will be tested by the 2008 album for which this is said to be a placeholder. See them live while you can.

I don't expect their diminishing lo-fi claque to care, but the third album from these briefly modish Kinshasa techno-primitives is also their best, for solid yet marginal reasons that boil down to recording quality: the buzzing distortions of their DIY-amped likembes are more distinct, and so are the unpop although not therefore untrained voices of three singers it is safe to assume got their first lessons before they were three. A jam band to the core, they don't craft their ""songs"" any more cunningly, but the effect is more song-like. Then, after 52 minutes, there's an unbuzzy finale: four minutes of acoustic likembe and aged voice which I call a coda and you may call a bore. To my medium-fi ears, this is where to begin. If having begun one then chooses not to continue, that would be reasonable. There's a lot of great music in the world--even in Kinshasa still I bet.

I always knew Batida's hard-ass beats were why I plucked his eponymous 2012 CD out of the welter of DJ albums--and knew they meant to be hard-ass, because that's how you translate the Angolan kuduro style he went electro with. But it took Crammed Discs schemer Vincent Kenis to alert me to the obvious: just as soukous's rippling polyrhythms once migrated south from Congo, there's a congruence between the modern Lusaka sound and the unforgiving attack of Kinshasa's 21st-century street bands--the much-missed Staff Benda Bilili and the self-renewing Konono No. 1. Now led by Agustin Makuntima Mawangu, whose late father originally rigged up their battery-powered likembes, Konono have always seemed a touch spare and samey at album length, and Batida is just the hard-ass to fill out their sonics without softening them. Here be guitars and handclaps, thick electronics and stuttering glitches, guest singers who can actually sing. Konono's steady improvement over four albums may have cost them primitivist cachet and novelty appeal. But don't be the kind of fool who thinks they're just repeating themselves.

His braggadocio and jibes at the fair sex also won't mollify liberals, but that's even less the point than it usually is. This man boasts for the sheer joy and truth value of it. He loves words more than any thesaurus or rhyming dictionary can teach, and though I'm sure he owns several, they're not where he got ""I'm a rap warrior/Elite Astoria/I'll take on a hundred and four-aya,"" not to mention ""Drip-drip-drippin' and pus-pus-pussin'."" Which latter isn't even the raunchiest moment on ""Go See the Doctor,"" a safe-sex song followed hard on by yet another monitory tribute to the dumbness of dick.

As a solitary rapper of the old school, locked into praising his own dick, mouth, and brain, Moe Dee doesn't have much room to stretch, but does he make the most out of it. He never lets the jaunty, out-of-kilter swing generated by his electronic percussion lie there--trick rhymes, variable lengths, filters, double tracks, sung refrains, and the occasional extra instrument all work to shift the beat without undercutting its dominance. He never throws a song away, and makes a virtue of ""sticking to themes""--last time sex, this time rap itself. The story of ""Wild Wild West"" and the sound of ""Way Way Back"" establish his back-in-the-day credentials. ""Don't Dance"" is the boast to end all boasts. And lest you think he's hung his jock out to dry, ""I'm a Player"" features the most realistic assessment of male chauvinism yet attempted in a music that makes a fetish of the disorder.

But none has rocked harder or livelier than Bassekou Kouyate's family business, where the part of the guitar is played by one, two, many modified lutes called ngonis. Even harder and livelier than 2013's breakout Jama Ko, this lacks the righteous fervor that fueled that explicitly anti-Islamist defense of a Mali ""where Islam and tolerance exist,"" as the new ""Abe Sumaya"" puts it. Its fervor is formal. Four tracks add trap drums to the hand-held percussion, Jon Hassell haunts another with trumpet and keyboards, and auxiliary white musicians pitch in without butting in. There are also full translated lyrics, which as happens with Afropop isn't always a plus. I'm glad Kouyate's lead singer and wife Amy Sacko gets one called ""Musow Fanga (Power of Woman)."" But especially given how powerfully she makes herself felt whenever she opens her mouth, I'm not so glad it equates that power with motherhood.

The rockish grandeur of this Guinean world-music ensemble sounds like it owes Santana. Probably doesn't, of course--we know where the polyrhythms started, and in 24 years Carlos has never risked a singer who could steal his thunder like this hereditary troubadour. On the other hand, Carlos can outplay the troubadour even though the troubadour counts himself a guitarist by trade. The crux is that most of the time Carlos's corn just sounds like corn. Kouyate's sounds like the staff of life.

No, I have not shorted out or fallen in love with a cyborg. No, I do not like Kraftwerk's previous craft-work, Radio-Activity, which consists mostly of bleeps. But this shares with Autobahn a simple-minded air of mock-serious fascination with melody and repetition. Plus its textural effects sound like parodies by some cosmic schoolboy of every lush synthesizer surge that's ever stuck in your gullet--yet also work the way those surges are supposed to work. Plus the cover and sleeve photos are suitable for framing.

FALSE,A-,Citizen Wayne,Wayne Kramer,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4154,"
The punk line on the MC5 is that their revolutionary pretensions were imposed by conniving hippie John Sinclair. So how come it was Fred Smith who got ""People Got the Power"" out of Patti? And how come Wayne Kramer has now enlisted ex-rad David Was in the most political record of either career? Despite one small-minded sectarian dis--nobody in my Trotskyite cell would be so gauche as to serve chips with pesto, let me assure you--these songs talk class and counterculture simultaneously, a rare thing, especially with the emphasis on the class. And musically, the two Detroiters tear up each other's roots as Was tilts Kramer's good old guitar toward the avant-funk it has long since deserved.

FALSE,A-,Now That I've Found You: A Collection,Alison Krauss,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=91,"
Even with the greatest voices, tastes are personal--where you might prefer Aretha's Diane Warren song, I'd probably go for Al Green's. Krauss isn't quite in that class, but after this compilation-plus overcame my personal penchants, I began to think she was only a notch below. However much fans appreciated the child prodigy for her fiddle, they love the woman for her kind, precise, intent soprano. And not only is this a singer's showcase, it's a pop singer's showcase. Sure she's still country--bluegrass, even. She's nothing if not principled. But she also ropes in not just the Beatles but the Foundations and, believe it or not, Bad Company. And by reclaiming guest tracks from specialist albums by Jerry Douglas, Tony Furtado, and the Cox Family, she oversteps the sonic boundaries of her admirable but specialized band. Best in show (after the Beatles, the Foundations, and Bad Company): a sexy little sacred number.

FALSE,A-,Totally Krossed Out,Kris Kross,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1966,"
One step up the evolutionary ladder from the cute boy on the steps who's rechristened Fabian or Vince Eager, these two Atlanta 13-year-olds are totally fabrikated. They contributed less to their beats, lyrics, and look than the New Kids. And not only is ""Jump"" one of those works of art that makes rock and roll worth living for, a trifle that sweeps all questions of import and integrity aside, but there's an album to go with it. Nineteen-year-old producer Jermaine Dupri writes for irrepressible 13-year-olds so set on enjoying the full privileges of adolescence that only a bad cop would enforce their curfew. Dupri exploits their preadolescent tempos and timbres to the max. And he shades their ebullient music with subtly disturbing samples only lil boys from the hood could be sad and savvy enough to call their own.

FALSE,A-,Floodplain,Kronos Quartet,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14625,"
Usually this staunchly eclectic string quartet forges alliances with non-Western musicians I'd as soon stand alone or works with Western composers who aren't to my taste. This collection of traditional music, classical music, pop songs, and special commissions from a broadly conceived Middle East is different. Dumb me found out from the notes that it was the two pop songs that always rang my chimes--one from Egypt circa 1940, the other from '70s Iraq. In the wrong mood, some of the others can seem too solemn, histrionic, drawn-out--slow. But there's nothing here that doesn't suit the right mood. There are cathedrals in Sicily that overlay Christian imagery on Islamic design in buildings that can accommodate all comers. This album brought them back.

His best, because the music has finally subsumed the lyrics--with outside guidance from Gang Starr's DJ Premier and others, the rapmaster's bassy beats and monophonic hooks have never sounded more catchy or more his own. Horn blats, ""Three Blind Mice"" guitar, siren imitation, human beat-box, whatever--all recur hypnotically and leave you hungry for more. Nor have the words fallen off. The history he teaches is mostly his own. And a couple of times he just kills the cops.

Listening to this selection bound all over his vast corpus, you're struck by two things. First, even striding off a Blondie sample he wouldn't have stooped to in his proud twenties, he always sounds like himself. Second, he never sounds like anyone else of much moment--except Run-D.M.C., called out on the early ""South Bronx."" His musical forthrightness has no modern-day parallels--Gang Starr are scatmen by comparison, the N.O. Bouncers parademasters. How much impact the right voice and beat could make back in the day--and still can, especially boiled down to stark strokes that stick in the mind. To hear in one place ""South Bronx,"" ""The Bridge Is Over,"" ""Criminal Minded,"" ""Black Cop,"" the sociologically perfect and metaphysically weird ""Love's Gonna Get'Cha,"" and the bullheaded history lesson ""Why Is That?"" is to learn that sometimes all a man needs to make great music is an idea he believes in.

Kris Parker has never been more didactic, and he's still working the same WTC-equals-WTO jive he was on in 2001. Motored by an exceptional collection of simple, clever hooks, however, his moralism packs considerably more wallop than the whining of white strivers and black artistes who think they're, you know, real hip-hop. Highlights include the cash-conscious ""Mr. Percy,"" the sin-naming ""F-cked Up,"" the enlightened ""Woke Up,"" and, most intense, ""Gimme Da Gun,"" in which Parker spits reasons not to do that crime as fast as he can, and his boy Raphi explains his side of the story. It ends with a shot.

A prize-winning Townes Van Zandt, Roy Orbison, and Roland Kirk biographer renowned in new-folk circles as the mandolin-motorvating founder of free-conceived NYC world-music troupe TriBeCaStan, Kruth got interested in Croatia because that's his artist wife's heritage. Recorded with on-site Croatian and overdubbed US musicians of casually impeccable chops, these melodically bent, structurally straightforward, verbally concrete songs were inspired by multiple visits to the bustling old Croatian beach city of Split. Delivered in Kruth's raspy, plaintive mandolinist's voice, they're a writer's songs whether praising women or lamenting politics--simple and pointed with just a few duds. And the four instrumentals are intro, interlude, and farewell enough.

On Kruth's second Croatia album, mostly American musicians render the tunes Kruth wrote for English translations of the poems of a wandering modernist bard who died blacklisted by Tito 60 years ago. It's more haunting than Splitsville, with Kruth's deliberate, nuanced, murmured, pitch-challenged, and once merely spoken vocals deepening its affect. The brief plucked folk-dance intro and Ujevic-inspired Kruth original ""Girl From Korcula"" brighten things up. But a six-minute ""Daily Lament"" that earns its title seems the peak--until it's topped by the five-minute closer ""Blood Brotherhood of Persons of the Universe,"" which also earns its title.

The book-length celebrator of Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Rubber Soul and leader of the departed TriBeCaStan is a native New Yorker who gets around. So having upped his game with two albums rooted in summers spent with his Croatian-born wife in the holiday port of Split, he crossed the Adriatic to cut 14 of his songs in Spoleto with a Neapolitan mandolinist he met in Manhattan. Thematically and geographically, the material gets around too, from a Milwaukee pal loading up a bag of Christmas goodies for poorer folks across the river to a tuna melt heated up on a desert dashboard to a cautionary reflection on Croatian Catholici""There's only one thing that I fear / When the old communist goes to church."" Switching among seven instruments including his own mandolin, honoring Sylvia Plath's paranoia, or playing checkers with his cat, he's no kind of singer except the kind Dylan let in the side door with his everyman impressions. But he sure has a broad compass. And he lives to convince anyone who'll listen that that's the best kind of compass to have--by miles.

Candidly commercial if not cockeyed drunk, a veteran entertainer from the melanin-rich upriver highlands leads a thoroughly modern band that favors the same stop-and-go tricks polka strategists love so.

Situated in that strangely familiar territory between kinda boring and utterly weird, Kuban was modernity's musical ambassador from Nubia, which some--mostly boring Afrocentric weirdos, but that doesn't make them wrong--regard as a prime source of the Mediterranean culture all Americans share. And though it says something about developmental feedback and lineaments of greatness that this wedding singer from an ancient land was known to tip his kufi to James Brown, his funk has always sounded indigenous to me. For one thing, it's melodic in an ancient, pentatonic way--that's the Nubian part. The instrumental sound is Egyptian right down to its big-city horns and accordions. And the vocals would fit into many black African contexts--think flat rather than showy, Wassoulou rather than Wolof. Kuban cut four albums after he began playing Europe in the '80s, and sometimes it's hard to tell whether they're trancelike or soporific. This draws on all of them. The best-of as public service.

FALSE,A-,Zombie,Fela Anikulapo Kuti,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1236,"
Fela Anikulapo Kuti is a Nigerian pianist-saxophonist who makes real fusion music--if James Brown's stuff is Afro-American, he is Amer-African. No U.S. percussion ensemble would distinguish between first and second conga, but Fela's harmonic, melodic, and improvisational ideas are all adapted from Afro-American (which means part European) models. His sax style recalls the honkers, but it's more staccato, more complex rhythmically. Not only that, there are lyrics, in English, with crib sheet--very political, very associative, explicitly antibook.
"
FALSE,A-,Army Arrangement,Fela Anikulapo Kuti,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1237,"
I've never had complete confidence in Fela's myth. By both African and Euro-American standards, his arrangements are repetitive, his singing and playing nothing special, and his political ideas ill-informed and grandiose. But as pop pros of any culture go, he's an original and a radical, and even if he weren't his music would deserve our attention and his imprisonment our abhorrence. Let's hope this Bill Laswell remix proves propitious. Rather than bedizening it with aural gee-gaws, Laswell imports sympatico cousins to beef up the groove--Bernie Worrell (on Hammond B-3!), Aiyb Dieng (on five different percussion devices), and, most spectacularly, Sly Dunbar, whose Simmons pulse could make a skinhead dance once foot at a time. Fela's best album--wonder if they'll let him hear it.

At 25:36, the 1974 ""Confusion"" is one Fela song/track/album it would be a waste to edit--from free-form intro to multiple solos to Tony Allen's one-man polyrhythms, it's the proof of Africa 70's presumptive funk. The horn work introducing ""Gentleman,"" omitted from the Best Best version, embodies the contradictions of that song's anti-European message. Two eight-minute Africanisms carry the package off into the bush.

FALSE,A-,The Best of the Black President 2,Fela Anikulapo Kuti,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16020,"
Compiled by U.K. Afropop advocate turned Fela specialist Chris May, this follow-up to the first volume (which adds naught but a DVD to MCA's essential 2000 Best Best of Fela Kuti) sets itself to showcasing the hero's stylistic range and political significance--rather than, for example, selecting another dozen slightly less compelling jams to spread over another two slightly less compelling CDs. There's a soulful slow track, a hoarse late track, a longer version of the first volume's ""Sorrow Tears and Blood,"" and not one but two Ginger Baker features, the earlier of which is, by the artist's very high standard, untogether groovewise. Fela's striking clarity reflects an arrogance his singing progeny Femi and Seul can't duplicate. His power to project like the rebel son of a politically prestigious mother he was lends authority to his ideas whether right-minded or wrong-headed. Most righteous by me is the song May can't resist repeating, an attack on state repression where Fela repeats ""Sorrow tears and blood"" again and again and a council of men and women chants back ""Dem regular trademark."" Why shouldn't it go on for 17 minutes?

Afrobeat is America's most imitated Afropop style because its Americanization runs so deep, and because its protest component appeals to the kind of Americans who think playing Afropop is a cool thing to do. The loping, polyrhythmic, funked-up groove Fela Kuti invented is pretty surefire, too--until you cue up an actual Fela record and remind your body how dynamic that ride can be. Not that Antibalas should feel bad--African Afrobeat musicians, what few there are, rarely hold up against Fela either, including his well-bred eldest son Femi. That's why this album by Fela's youngest son is such an event. Commandeering his father's old band, he generates surer and leaner propulsion than Fela himself did in the decade preceding his 1997 death, and though Seun's rough pidgin doesn't rivet you like Fela's speechifying shout, he projects a sense of mission and outrage rare in scions claiming a genius's revolutionary legacy. Plus this: Smack in between ""Na Oil"" and ""Mosquito Song"" comes ""Fire Dance,"" where Fela's 69-year-old trap drummer Baba Jasco gallops louder than ever before over the cantering legacy of his famed bandmate Tony Allen.

At this historical distance they're at least as far out there as their inspirations Will Shade and Gus Cannon, neither of whom followed his harmonica player onto a commune when he decided he was God (Mel Lyman, you could look it up), and their selected works pack more fun than Yazoo's muddled Ruckus Juice and Chitlins comps: ""Beedle Um Bum,"" ""Ukelele Lady,"" ""Borneo,"" ""Never Swat a Fly,"" and a Maria Muldaur ""Richland Woman"" that couldn't make you forget John Hurt but might just inspire you to look him up.

Not all pretentious records are even difficult and many fewer are worth the trouble. This is both. In the past I've found myself unmoved by Patti LaBelle's high-nosed histrionics, but Allen Toussaint grounds her (and Nona and Sarah) in a funk that's just right, more modernistic and mechanical than he usually favors. And for once there are songs. Three of Nona Hendryx's four could be called tunes, Bob Crewe and Kenny Nolan's ""Lady Marmalade"" is great synthetic French-quarter raunch, and Toussaint's own ""All Girl Band"" is unautobiographical and more charming for it.

Two Kosovan masterminds, two Macedonian horn players, and two Serbians manning guitar and bass pursue pan-Balkan dub in Austrian exile. The music isn't as hot or goulash-like as stay-at-homes will hear from cosmopolitans who slum around looking for ""interesting, romantic people,"" to quote chief mastermind Irina Karamarkovic. It's sprightly, light, controlled, although danceable if you know the steps and probably if you don't. Karamarkovic's small, supple voice and Anglophone lyrics infuse the lightness with brains and laughter, which for me equals sex appeal. Keep all your smoky EU chanteuses and their safe-word s&amp;m. I'll take this sometime voice teacher tempting a fate she defies by name, warning of bandits who rob the brain-dead, chiding slivovich-sipping tourists in one verse and cheerfully encouraging them to come on come on the next.

I liked the 14-track 2008 version of this album, augmented in this two-CD set by an eight-song EP of comparable quality. But only after being overwhelmed by the sheer visibility of her warp-speed relaunch did I realize how enjoyable and inescapable her hooks and snatches had turned out to be. Even if you consider her videos and such overelaborate, as I do, her songs are streamlined pop machines. Some are more efficient than others--I prefer the ""Poker Face"" hook as jacked by Kid Cudi and Lil Wayne to Gaga's sandbagging original. But even the slower ones have a way of taking off, in part because she writes lyrics like a paper gangster. The tell is ""Money Honey,"" an apparent descent into ever crasser materialism that instead revives a short-lived slang usage of ""money."" His Jag, enjoyable. His kisses, money.

First of all, avoid the ""Special Edition."" Of the three extra songs, only ""The Queen"" would be a decent B side, and the remixes are as unnecessary as usual. Even at normal length, moreover, this isn't up to The Fame or The Fame Monster. But both of those keep growing, and with its mad momentum and nutty thematics, this one could too--despite being laid down on tour trailed by 28 semis. Ever the non-Catholic, I let ""Judas"" and ""Bloody Mary"" slide while going all googly-eared for the hilarious ""Hair,"" where the nimbus of every woman's vanity becomes the cutting edge of every woman's freedom, and ""Americano,"" a marriage proposal to a Chicana in a flowered skirt that's as sincere and unreliable as The Fame Monster's ""Alejandro,"" where the title inamorato keeps morphing into Fernando and Roberto. This lags seriously only on the one with unicorns in it, a no-no not even Gaga can safely defy, and a big closer that just doesn't take the whole effort over the top where it belongs. The country song in particular is a hoot, which reminds me that the title track wasn't inspired solely by ""Express Yourself."" Close your eyes on the refrain and you can almost hear Carl Perkins lining out ""You've got the right string baby but the wrong yo-yo.""

This immensely successful South African vocal ensemble isn't my kind of thing. Their lyrics are in Zulu, which may be just as well, since they probably serve culturally conservative values. They employ no instruments, drums most certainly included, and generate almost no pulse; they sound like a glee club. And since I've never heard them before, I can't tell you how their umpteenth album stacks up. All I know is it's amazing--serious, intricate, droll, eerie, precisely rehearsed, and very beautiful. It's too thoughtful to fade into the background, but like so much good African music it possesses calmative properties. Anyone who thinks he or she might like it probably will.

How does one distinguish between this album of a cappella Zulu gospel music and the other album of a cappella Zulu gospel music available in discriminating record stores? Well, this one came out first back home, which may mean it's purer and may mean it's less advanced and probably means nothing. On this one, they wear choir robes instead of tribal garb and say amen and hallelujah, which may be why it's not as much fun. The easiest way to tell them apart, though, is that the other one is called Induku Zethu. Write it down. They're both pretty good, believe me.

Unless I learn Zulu (long shot) or someone starts providing trots (great idea), chances are my favorite Ladysmith album will always be the first one I listened to, 1984's Induku Zethu. But your favorite will probably be the first one you listen to, and if you were busy in 1984 you might help Paul Simon do a good deed and start here. By now you should know what you'll get: a male a cappella chorus comprising two families of brothers and cousins in which Joseph Shabalala's cunning tenor darts in and out of the harmonic brush. Though they can dance to it, you probably can't, but unless you're hopelessly culture-bound you'll soon hear how beautiful it is. As a crossover gesture there's one song in English, full of sly domestic observations that provide welcome insight into how they deploy both words and sounds.

Though I continue to prefer the curlicued sound effects of Induku Zethu, the lyric sheet alone (with four songs in English!) makes this the Ladysmith album of choice for any normal U.S. dabbler. Roy Halee separates the harmonic elements just enough to enhance their fit and shows off Joseph Shabalala's grainy tenor, which anybody but a devoted family man would go solo with tomorrow. The politics settle in around a generalized gospel yearning, but the sheer sound is gorgeous enough to embarrass most Americans.

Joseph Shabalala is a modest fellow only on the surface--black South Africans neglect that role at their peril. From the stylistic revolution he imposed on his chosen style to his principled pursuit of international glory, he has the lineaments of a pop visionary, and here he arrives at a crossover that does the style proud, moving gracefully from Zulu to English within and between songs and pumping the a cappella rhythms with instruments on three cuts. Twice Ray Phiri masterminds suitably simple mbaqanga tracks, but the big man is George Clinton, whose ""Scatter the Fire"" neither obscures nor ignores the singers with their name on the cover. I urge the Jungle Brothers to volunteer for a remix.

By selecting for ""musical quality"" from the wealth of product Joseph Shabalala has conceived for his group's presold Azanian fans, Randall Grass concentrates the lively and tuneful while respecting the intricately harmonized and subtly dramatic.

But not only have they avoided the rut, they've reinvented themselves--with one brother murdered, another departed, and a cousin also gone, Joseph Shabalala enlisted three of his sons and pushed on. And if anything, he's gotten better at arranging and producing the comic details that are the unsung delight of the vocal beauty he perfected.

Their sound effects ought to be funny enough in themselves (try the kisses on ""Hello My Baby""), but their awkward repartee will convince the properest sobersides that it's OK to laugh. Their rhythms are more pronounced as well--too bad you can't see the steps. Their English repertoire is limited, so the half where you'll understand the words is re makes; their Zulu repertoire is vast, so the half where you won't isn't.

Often this highly evolved, showbiz-savvy family choir have courted their international target market of congenial folkies by keeping company with their many admirers in Western pop. This has been dodgy musically, and although their filigreed tenor blend is hard to ruin, 2006 collaborations with Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Natalie Merchant were not propitious. But on this self-released album a South African female provides blessed relief: semi-retired 73-year-old Joseph Shabalala's late wife Nellie, who was murdered in a murky 2002 incident just as her Women of Mambazo choir was about to go international itself. Through the earthly miracle of magnetic tape, Joseph's men and Nellie's women join their voices, and the differentiation is just the thing to make Ladysmith's fifty-somethingth album ring out. Gorgeous has never been their main thing--they're wittier and more intricate than that. But this is gorgeous.

She tried to show the Yanks at Def Jam how funky she was, only she wasn't, so now she's stuck on a DIY imprint that with her chin-up sass she claims leaves her free as a bird. Actually, of course, she'll take any job she can get, and pragmatism suits her. Rapping or singing, club or pop, she's cranking ditties so insignificant they're precious, like a bottle shard that resembles a bulldog's head or a constable's badge. For her grime now is punk. Soused at the student union bar, licking Haagen-Dazs off her beau in literally filthy foreplay, she's weird and you're weird. That makes you mates.

Despite Young Thug, Nicki Minaj, the incomparable Lil Wayne, etc., my working assumption is that mixtapes are uneven-by-design promotional come-ons doubling as status markers for early adopters. But with the artist formerly known as K-Dot so iconic he's marketing outtakes as a concept album, it was clearly time to check out this easily downloaded 2010 double-dare-ya, the crown jewel of more freebies than I can list. And soon I found it was on a par with official debut Section.80. Only three classics: the besotted ""Alien Girl,"" the merely sexed-up ""P&amp;P 1.5,"" and ""Average Joe,"" a position paper for the gangsta realism to follow. But the many cameos document a party-crashing crew utterly delighted by how good they are at this shit. There's a sense of fun and antic possibility here Lamar abjured on his road to iconicity. In pop music, that's a spiritual resource there's never enough of.

The rap-versus-real dichotomy Saigon moralizes anthemically Lamar enacts softspokenly in this so-called ""short film."" (Concept album? In 2012? Nah.) The accuracy of its intimate autobiographical details is irrelevant--what matters is that this album helps you feel the internal struggles of a good kid who may not be good enough as he risks derailing his life by succumbing to the kneejerk loyalty, petty criminality, and gang warfare of the hood he calls home. Nobody is heroic here, including Lamar--from Christian strivers to default sociopaths, all the players are confused, weary, bored, ill-informed, with disconcertingly naturalistic, almost verit? skits dramatizing their limitations. The commitment to drama has musical drawbacks--there are no dancefloor bangers here, and not many fully distinct songs, although more hooks than you'll first believe. But the atmospheric beats Dr. Dre and his hirelings lay under the raps and choruses establish musical continuity, shoring up a nervous flow that's just what Lamar's rhymes need.

FALSE,A-,To Pimp a Butterfly,Kendrick Lamar,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16327,"
What I admire most and enjoy most about this album is that it addresses African-Americans straight up and leaves the rest of the hip-hop audience to listen in if it wants. It's a strong, brave, effective bid to reinstate hip-hop as black America's CNN--more as op-ed than front page, but in the Age of Twitter that's the hole that needs filling. Fortunately, the concept starts with the music, which eschews party bangers without foregoing groove, sampling rhythm godfathers P-Funk, Michael Jackson, and the Isley Brothers and building a house band around jazz pianist Robert Glasper and what-you-got bassist Thundercat. But it's even more racially explicit in lyrics that don't protest racism because what good does that ever do--just assumes it as a condition of life for his people, root cause of the cultural breakdowns he laments and preaches against throughout. Acknowledged only in passing is a mega-success too obvious to go on about, not to mention enjoy--a privilege that's also a temptation, to which he responds not with hater paranoia but with a depressive anxiety that resurfaces as a narrative hook without ever starting a pity party. Lamar knows he's got it good. For his people he wants better. Few musicians of any stylistic persuasion are so thoughtful or so ardent. Few musicians have so little need of a hooky review.

I can't stand Bilal's endless Barry White impression, ""untitled 07"" proves the young artiste is right to question his own self-regard, and to beware of the crappy jazz lesser rappers will soon foist on a gullible marketplace. Right, even these negatives have positives--with Bilal sated ""untitled 01"" sets an aptly apocalyptic tone, Lamar doesn't wander out of control until the last third of that overblown eight-minute track, and Thundercat's exceptional bass finds drums to match all over the record. Moreover, the darkness of tone suits the connoisseurship and marginality this side project's format and release strategy insist on. So right, said project is worthwhile, occasionally exciting. But in addition to untitled and unmastered, it's unfinished, and a bit of a cheat.

Thematically, these thoughts of a pushing-30 superstar are almost conventional compared to the rest of his official output--good kid, m.A.A.d city's top-this narrative, To Pimp a Butterfly's political ambition and jazz-hip sweep, even untitled, unmastered's barrel-scraping scatter. Old head Greg Tate is reminded of De La Soul Is Dead--it's the kind of album you make after you've experienced fame's drawbacks from the inside. But this one's much harder to resist. Lamar's pensive self-doubt and modest buying habits are reassuring if you wish him well as a person, as why shouldn't you, and the simple keys-percussion-chorus beats flatter his cushiony timbre. Musically, Damn. is as calm as To Pimp a Butterfly is ebullient; lyrically, its only misstep is a pseudo-scriptural ""don't call me black no more"" that inspired Tate to quote Franz Fanon. Remaining skeptics should proceed directly to what vinyl fetishists know as side two, with its hit single, its ""Lust""-to-""Love,"" its remembrance of ass-whuppings past, and its autobiographical miracle. He got what he wanted without squandering what he had.

Of course she's quieting down as she grows up, plus covering her bases, so after half a dozen winners she levels off into a nine-song sequence that begins lame with ""Makin' Plans,"" ends lame with ""Virginia Bluebelle,"" and strides along quite nicely in between. And since growing up also means learning to hit your target without discharging your weapon, the grinning ""Only Prettier"" and the killer metaphor ""Me and Your Cigarettes"" establish a welcome lightness. In case you had any doubts, Lambert asserts her distance from Music Row by covering John Prine, Julie Miller, and Fred Eaglesmith, the last of whom buys her a gun. Which I guess is how it comes to pass that, in the one that she wrote with her squeeze, the girl catches the boy in bed with some other her and shoots that sinner dead.

Lambert's not in it for another ""Kerosene,"" not with the Pistol Annies ready whenever she feels like a joy ride. She's in it for another ""The House That Built Me""--a heartsong that lets housewives-they-wish forget their day jobs for the length of a bathroom break. She's too brand-savvy to lead with the soft stuff: ""All Kinds of Kinds"" stars a cross-dressing congressman, ""Fine Tune"" links Auto-Tune to sexual excitation, and the Angeleena Presley-assisted ""Fastest Girl in Town"" ends with Miranda abandoning her man for the cop who caught them speeding. But this does wind down into your basic quality country album. Corn is fine with me--the two-sided ""Safe,"" say. ""Dear Diamond,"" ""Oklahoma Sky,"" the oh-so-soulful Blake collab ""Better in the Long Run""--they're cornball.

The difference is palpable. The Mekons, Waco Brothers, Killer Shrews, and I forget who are/were groups that couldn't do without Langford, whereas this is Langford deploying backup musicians, aides-d'arte who happen to be Wacos as well. There's no band feel, no sense of music-in-process--the garrulous artiste is audibly up top, organizing structural support for a sheaf of good tunes, and while the best of these is courteously passed on to Gertrude Stein, who wrote the words to ""Butter Song,"" all the rest belong to Jonboy. Anyone who's tried to keep up with his one-liners knows he's an articulate bastard, but he's better off when he doesn't have to get to the end in 75 words or less, which is why his country band has always thrived on covers. Here he runs on, confessing his antisocial tendencies like the singer-songwriter he temporarily is--without forgetting that capitalism is antisocial too.

Right, he's got all those other albums--Pine Valley Cosmonauts, Mekons of course, Waco Brothers. But there he was just the compere, or had to share the writing with his mates. This isn't enough when you have a calling to pursue, a family to support, a world to curse and mourn--when nothing can shut you up. Lyrics that despair of politics, find true pain in true love, unhinge from terra firma, and gripe about the road are delivered with country plainness, glimmers of spirituality, plenty of rolled r's, and the sense that by singing reality you can make it mean something, at least while you're at it. Not ""Before they stop me""; more like ""As long as I still can.""

Once it hits home, the opening ""Summer Stars"" could be the gravest song of his life, a threnody for an earth ruined by the ecological/economic catastrophe most of us foresee in our grimmer moments--a vision no less vivid or plausible for its reliance on metaphor. The metaphors that follow are easier to duck and in the case of the amelodic ""Mars"" ignore. But starting midway in with ""Drone Operator,"" the lyrics become more pointed, one political indictment after another, with Langford's precisely articulated, barely contained rage his version of what they call soul.

Blimey, another pop group with guitars--quartet from Liverpool, no less. Once in a blue moon, though, somebody with the gift comes along, and frontman Lee Mavers is that somebody. Given his spunky-to-grotty voice (think Colin Hay or early Cat Stevens--of Men at Work and ""Matthew and Son"" respectively, you uncultured dolts), they don't sound enough like the Beatles, and I hope that in a hit or two they find themselves a drummer they can tie to his or her chair, because too often the beat is vestigial (think Quarrymen).

Having folded all three of their live caterwauls into one hedged pick in 1987, I missed the real album a year later, but 27 years after that it still rocks. Studio provenance is the ticket. There's a shape and specific gravity to these 10 sub-five-minute tracks that I attribute to Laswell, who's always specialized in getting legible music out of the avant fringe, and a life force I attribute to Jackson even more than Sharrock--solid as the music is, he never stops bubbling under. When ""Sick steers in a farm field moo amid a tornado, then Sonny Sharrock's guitar starts yanking the sound back in, restating a warped melody from one of his own records.

Lyrics Born is deep and contemplative, Lateef speedy and confrontational, and together--on DJ Shadow's heads-up lead track, simultaneously, with only a balance knob and some small print between you and the crash of your rhyme-processing program--their playful mastery has no parallel in today's rap. Not all that many precedents, either, although it's significant that several aren't ghettocentric: early De La, 3rd Bass. They take more pleasure in words themselves than in tales, messages, explicit content. That granted, note that Lateef's riff on ""those that talk most got the least to say"" merits all the attention it gets, and that Lyrics Born's ""Balcony Beach"" is rap at its most spiritual--motherfucker actually seems wise. Except on the predictable boast tracks toward the end, their language elevates the music even when homeboy Shadow isn't producing, as he usually isn't.

A Detroit-born, Memphis-based ex-punk with a soft voice and a boyfriend who gave her the business, LaVere leaves her wan alt-country debut behind with help from producer Jim Dickinson and a song about killing the boyfriend. Dickinson provides the hint of a groove that his young admirer Paul Taylor failed to deliver last time--and maybe also, songcatcher that he is, a few of the seven tracks his charge didn't write, like the tipsy ""Pointless Drinking"" or the insatiable ""Washing Machine."" The song about killing her boyfriend provides the shock that will convince you there's a solid substratum underneath. ""Killing him didn't make her love go away,"" she coos sadly, looking at herself from a distance she's not sure she ever wants to breach.

A self-made orphan and lousy pretender according to her titles, she purrs her post-blues in her soft little soprano like a pussycat lapping up cream before climbing that tree, which is where she begins the one that ends ""Leavin' is gonna rock."" Any horndog who thinks strong women rough up their voices and show off their tits is fixing to wind up with his tail between his legs.

She spent years playing acoustic bass for rockabilly pilgrims at Sun Studios; he was shoehorned into her tiny road band until they figured out how good they were together. Now married and on perpetual tour, they recorded these many remakes and few new ones to analog tape in a Memphis studio that could be their living room, and there's terrific synergy to it.

Unless you're down with his clubrat semblables, James Murphy is hard to like, projecting cynicism with that chansonnier-derived Bowie-thrice-removed theatricality the Eurofied slip into like a thrift-store tux. That said, cynicism always has yuk potential, as in the debut's ""Losing My Edge,"" the follow-up's ""North American Scum,"" and this supposed finale's wicked ""Drunk Girls."" So I gave the lyrics some time and got somewhere with them. Witty, yes--the nonstop plays on ""present company"" in ""Dance Yrself Clean,"" the tossed-off nay-saying of ""You Wanted a Hit,"" a bounty of individual lines. But I reserve my love for Murphy's post-cynicism--romantic regrets and longings that might as well be autobiographical. Sweetening his electrobeats with concessions to tune, his gibes with pained entreaties and funny stumbles, he reaccesses the humanist inside him as if that's every hipster's right--which it pretty much is.

By arty I mean Art Ensemble or maybe just AACM: several tunes where all the hook and half the pulse is a bass part that's more ostinato than rhythm line, plus a lyrically desultory duet between main man Arthur Blythe and weak link Kirk Lightsey and a group improv that grows out of Lester Bowie's mute.

Plus, right, this: ""My love of fashion came of being poor."" Everything else we must infer from her lyrics. On her new album, for instance, there's enough detail about historically black colleges in the Greek victory chant ""Roll Call"" to suggest she attended an HBC herself, although the Broad and Lombard hint places it in Philadelphia, which isn't home to a single one, a smokescreen typical on on album that gets down to cases even so. Articulated in a Lauryn Hill fan's clear, island-tinged flow is a tour of a shy, smart, moderately successful young woman's hood: the nail salons and girl blunts, the sexist UGs and subway makeout sessions, the dumpster babies and relatives who need more help than you can afford to give them. The evidence that she's as musical as Hill, much less her beloved Michael Jackson, is sketchy. But what an up it is to hear a soulful survivor-and-then-some try to get there.

But unlike Richman, he's devoid of irony, slapstick, or post-rockist snark--his words and melodies project his innocence so unassumingly you have to assume that's who he is.

On the merry ""Folk Music for the Midlands,"" the energy sustains even when Lennon and Flynn are bidding each other a resigned and lyrical farewell.

In other words, more Celtic Tiger jeremiads in which Lennon mocks a prosperity that's leaving everyone he knows behind. Maybe he wasn't yet economist enough to understand how its banking and real estate scams would soon blow up in the nation's face. But he was scold enough to see how fucked up things were anyway. Highlights among these 30 stabs at enlightenment in 60 minutes include: the health-conscious ""Don't Lose a Stone for Xmas,"" the jerry-built ""Houses Everywhere,"" the disquieting ""Balaclava Boys,"" the lulling ""You Shouldn't Try to Fuck Someones Head Up,"" ""Next Slow Song You Hear May Leave You Pregnant"" with its flavored condom, ""550 Euros"" with its princess pram.

Although he dedicates these 18 tracks to his wife and little girl and sings them more than he recites them, this tenacious hospital porter and chronicler of the so-called Irish Free State hasn't softened up any unless you count rooting for a gal who takes a bread knife to the turkey-neck bully who's kicking her out. He's still hectoring layabouts, chronicling toilers, and mocking nouvies, although these days he's also skewering the bogus trappings of Irish patriotism and the porousness of the Ulster border. In addition, his specialty in the working class makes Trump a snap. Why aren't more Americans writing mean, obvious songs like ""Silver Spoon""? 'Cause they know shit about the working class and care less is what I figure.

I grant that it's superfluous--basically an Apple best-of plus John's songs from Double Fantasy. It goes on my A shelf because John was John, not just half of John &amp; Yoko. Also because it omits the half-cocked ""Cold Turkey"" and ragtag ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" from the official Apple best-of and doesn't medley ""Give Peace a Chance.""

As someone who scoffs at the outtake collections of known improvisers, I doubt I'll be delving into the box too often, although the live stuff is worth hearing. But not only does this one-disc distillation spare borderline obsessives financial anxiety, it proves Lennon the great singer he's rarely remembered as. Whether the alternate rearrangements are drastic (Cheap Trick on ""I'm Losing You,"" strings on ""Grow Old With Me"") or subtle (pianoless ""God,"" single-tracked ""Oh My Love""), every song is renewed by a vocal commitment that shades the canonical take, usually toward sweetness or rage. There's new material, too: blues cover, Platters cover, pledge of love, and the priceless Dylan answer song ""Serve Yourself."" Lennon wasn't above dabbling in religion. But he never got so down he mistook God for more than a concept by which he measured his pain.

Declares big-bearded performance poet Pip: ""I ain't riding the beat, it's the beat that's riding me."" Take it or leave it. But Pip and his beatmaking partner, both denizens in good standing of London's working-class suburbs and record-store culture, are certainly more musical than the Streets, arguably more musical than Dizzee Rascal, and stick Art Brut in there too. As U.K. electro goes, they're varied stylistically and open-minded about hooks, and Pip's articulated Cockney has a lilt. More rhetorician than storyteller--most momentously on the bandname-checking Brit sensation ""Thou Shalt Always Kill""--he distinguishes himself from yer average pop philosopher by having something to say. Try the suicide advisory ""Magician's Assistant."" Or ""Letter From God to Man,"" which makes the Big Fella a ""curator"" rather than a ""creator."" Or ""Tommy C,"" a definition of beauty that tells a comedian's life story, philosophically.

Pip's as unapologetic about being a self-conscious artist as he is about being a words-first artist, so he begins with a recitation on the unpromising subject of writer's block that becomes genuinely rousing as the words build momentum willy-nilly. There's also a chorus for kids consisting entirely of the words ""get better."" And there's ""The Beat"": ""This one ain't about the words the words the words the words."" As well it shouldn't be: Just because Dan le Sac knows where his synths and samples belong doesn't mean he isn't an equal partner. Great Britain doesn't make ""the best music in the world,"" you silly beardo. But A Tribe Called Quest should be proud they got you going.

Though it's billed as ""dance music from West Africa"" (these folkie labels, anything for a buck), what you notice is more for the ears than the feet--the emotional range of Mali tenor Salif Keita, a far more stirring singer than the renowned Rochereau, and the way Kante Manfila's guitar anchors synth here and horns there. Gorgeous. And if you wonder what Keita's emoting about, read the notes. He doesn't much like war, prefers past leaders to present, hopes the poor man's prayers will be answered but que sera sera, praises not just cops but also informers for combating the drug scourge, and passionately opposes the newfangled practice of men marrying women older than themselves. Oh well.

Where Rounder's first Ambassadeurs reissue was a vocal treasure-house billed to the band, this attempt to cash in on Keita's modest portion of fame is a band showcase headlined by the vocalist. Keita had left before one track was recorded, and on all five the instrumental bed is more seductive than the excellent singing it supports. You wait for Kante Manfila's guitar, for the oddly tuned horn riffs, for the unidentified keyb (Farfisa? Casio?) that evokes heavy wah-wah, cheap alto sax, unalloyed synthesizer. Penciling shadows of kora and kalimba behind local beats and copycat tintinnabulations, it documents a moment before West African dance music had figured out what to do with Congolese hegemony or its own traditionalism, and a lovely moment it must have been.

Root as in cheer and root as in stick your snout in the mud, and though I wish their vision of apocalypse had more finance and less earthquake in it, maybe the protagonists of the lead ""Appetites"" cover that option. The reason you'll care is that these guys came to understand how much Fugazi would be improved by songcraft and also how to provide same. The reason you may not care all that much is that the songs do cheer ruin on. ""Excess Energies,"" which depicts a scenemaker's progress from fake ID to broke 35 and beyond, feels more autobiographical than it probably is. ""Lips 'n Stuff"" celebrates and dissects the friends-with-benefits trap.

Here's one new rock record whose optimistic abandon is specifically conceived as a response to deprivation and attack. Or so I theorize--could just be that they got more jam than Sum 41 or the Strokes. They're not at their best when they catalog grievances (e.g. ""F.Y.R.,"" for ""fifty years of ridicule""). Who is? But over and above their jam, they're committed to naming names and utterly unwilling to give up on lives they're still learning to enjoy. It's not just ""the ladies and the fags"" who need that example anymore. Never was.

Fortunately, they also do what all maturing s.-p.o.w.t.a. wish they could do--write better songs. I noticed the guitar roar first and the tunes second. But I stayed for the lyrics. ""There's a Rockstar in My Room"": ""But they wouldn't want to stay."" ""I Forgot"": ""I may be a few hours late."" ""In the Suburbs"": ""I'll have dinner with my mother then play computer games all night."" ""For My Mother"": ""If the children need to go to school/Well I'll do that.""

So maybe the idea of this oddly constructed album is to ""turn"" from some OK meditative songs at track five, commencing a run of six A-OK outgoing ones before re""turn""ing to three meditative ones--and then breaking a minute of silence with the gangsta-ripping ""Mosquito Mass Murderist""? That's a guideline, anyway. Try ""Cult Boyfriend,"" one of the funnier and more philosophical of the many reflections on romantic frustration this lifetime bohemian's cult career has afforded. Or ""When You're by Yourself,"" one of the sadder and more touching of the many reflections on romantic frustration this lifetime bohemian's cult career has afforded. Or the all-encompassing ""Krongu Green Slime,"" a cartoonist-cum-folkie's six-minute history of consumerism from ""the time before land"" to ""the time after land."" It's also about the meaning of life, if there is one.

Wry and contemplative, suddenly established anti-folkie delivers strophic tunes about the riddles of eternity, a pet pig of questionable historicity, trying to catch some Z's on a Greyhound bus, and that greatest of all riddles, love. Aided by his rickety little band, every one flows unimpeded by musical fooforaw, the occasional chorus included. At his worst, Lewis can be a wise-ass scold. At his best he's a vulnerable master of the humorously ineffable and a tribute to the humanism of a SUNY education and the Lower East Side.

After a five-year absence if you don't count the time she threw herself away on Johnathan Rice--which if we are to take these songs autobiographically (as of course we are not) is kind of a syndrome with her--Lewis's formal command remains a wonder. If terse, well-turned, literal, indelible songcraft is so easy, why can't Aimee Mann or Gillian Welch or for that matter a more attractive character like Elizabeth Morris bring it off right down to the B sides? Every melody stands alone; every arrangement tops it off; every vocal nails it; every lyric parses with just enough mystery and mordant self-regard to make you crave some backstory. But her bad romances are so nonstop that their cumulative effect wears thin. You begin to suspect that her characters never achieve the consummations they think they wish because it isn't love they're looking for--it's perfection, or control.

More autobiographical, less dynamic--that is, a solo debut. Fortunately, the story outlined in the blurred title tune has the virtue of setting the record straight if you take it literally, always a chancy tack. Child actress or no, the Rilo Kiley frontperson says she grew up poor. Last time she heard (or is this just narrative compression?), her mom was living in her car and putting stuff up her nose. And though the singer-with-backup music relies on formula that won't set anyone's life straight, her melodic chops--sweet as a writer, supple as a singer--put the songs across. Dramatic and literary chops also help.

His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable boogie-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of the void make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller. He's a country artist out of geography and simple pique at rock's scared-shitless powers-that-be--it was the inadequacy of country's moralism, after all, that drove him to rockabilly. So though sheer talent insures that his reading of such great songs as ""Another Place Another Time"" and ""She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye"" will be definitive, he doesn't sound at home goody-goodying ""To Make Love Sweeter for You."" Nor are all of his throwaways as startlingly on top of it as ""One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)."" And it's only when he can repent of his sins from the luxurious slime of the pit--on ""What's Made Milwaukee Famous"" and ""She Still Comes Around""--that he comes completely into his own.

Last time I saw this fugitive from Madame Tussaud's was a 1984 performance video that convinced me Mr. Scratch had collected his half of the bargain in advance. So I expected nothing from this live-at-the-Palomino rehash, James Burton or no James Burton. And was immediately confronted with a ""You Win Again"" so bitter, so reconciled, so defeated, so above-it-all, so miserable that for a few songs I suspected the monkey-gland shots had worked--except that he sounds old, old and lecherous, old and lecherous and determined to enjoy it. Things do wear down in the middle, and the voice can get weird, and caveat emptor: if these versions aren't identical to the 11 duplicated songs on Tomato's companion volumes, the country Heartbreak and the rockin' Rocket '88, Jerry Lee taught his best tricks to Milli Vanilli. Nashville-haters may prefer Rocket '88--""Chantilly Lace"" and ""Headstone"" are keepers. But the true-pop ""Harbor Lights"" and ""You Belong to Me"" suit his ecumenical voracity, and James Burton is hot wherever. When and if he finally dies, Jerry Lee's gonna challenge Mr. Scratch to a piano-playing contest. Then he's gonna show Cousin Jimmy his ass.

But though I'd love to hear her ""Harper Valley P.T.A."" (or ""Fist City,"" or ""9 to 5""), she's Jerry Lee's sister, wild-ass before she's anything else. She doesn't ignore country on this band-centered studio job, but except for Billy Swan's ""I Can Help"" (""If your child needs a mama we can discuss that too""), the standouts are from Wolf-Justman, Dave Edmunds, Bob Dylan, all of whom should be damn proud. Covering ""They Called It Rock,"" she gets up to ""Someone in the newspaper said it was shit,"" and instead of rushing discreetly on to the next line she draws out that last word with the relish of a gal who's waited to sing it all her life.

Nobody's gonna sit and listen for two hours and 20 minutes without even a chorus to ease the rush of words and riffs and bumpy beats--not unless they're working, like I was when I did. But the sheer bulk of these two CDs is their charm. Debut and singles and EPs andcompilation cuts, almost every piece of crap this Minneapolis four-piece ever recorded except an album that's less impressive for being better shaped, and not counting a few early losers stuck in back they form one pretty damn good song: postpunk noir at the economic margins, drugs and sex and rock and roll in that order, an epic best intoned in toto around a verboten communal ashtray in some after-hours den. Craig Finn spouts like a jaded Conor Oberst and tells his underworld tales like a slacker Hamell on Trial, whose fame he may yet match. I wonder how many he made up. That's the fun part, right?

Since neither sex mystics nor Phil Spector fans favor deep thought or articulated emotion, I'm sure the lissome Li has no more to say in Swedish than in the English she writes in. The meaning's in the music, which to her considerable benefit shares the widespread Stockholm suspicion that the distinction between pop and dance music isn't worth troubling yourself over, but is nonetheless pinned for appearance's sake to the shades of yearning that mark it verbally. Philosophically and psychologically, it's pretty silly. But it would be priggish to show the door to a gal who can add so much pseudotribal percussion to a perfect 10 in the tune department. Ah to be young and full of come. Dumb I'll leave to those who think she's got a bead on tragedy and whatnot.

He moves in more select company: less genius than late Chic or recent Prince, but far more daring than Daniel Bedingfield or Craig David. Although Lidell's voice lacks muscle and butter, he knows how to launch a falsetto, and the beats on ""A Little Bit More"" and ""The City"" should not be played within earshot of anyone wearing a pacemaker. He goes out on a wan five-minute ballad called ""Game for Fools."" But before then he's stated his creed with a lyric recommended to all white guys in the future-funk game, which also isn't for fools: ""I'm a question mark, walking talking question mark/But what is the question again?""

Words come first in even the best underground hip hop. This Oregon trio leads with a sound, less catholic than that of their teachers De La Soul but still plenty absorptive--jazzlike, with a fluid Jamaican under-current. Although the record would stop dead if beats didn't switch from song to song, the same bounce brands them all. Then come the rhymes, which are witty, humane, political, all that good underground stuff (also Christian, a virtue, and speaking of virtues, anti-obscurantist). In my favorite, Vursatyl fends off annoying visits from a braggart MC (""we're 30 deep and each member's a mutant combination of six animals""), only to realize the egomaniac is himself, and a good thing too--without his secret belief that he's the greatest rapper in the universe, he couldn't be a good one.

They care about tune, and though they're all-instrumental they're about as ""post""-rock as Slayer, Nine Inch Nails, or Sonny Sharrock. Brian Gibson's bass sounds like a guitar half the time, especially when he's stating themes, which tend to be droll, perhaps because they anticipate the cacophony to come, perhaps because you do.

Two major negatives: David Burd has zero-to-crap politics despite the liberal parents who wish he'd stuck with the ad agency, as documented by ""Oh Well,"" and he can't sing, as documented by many assiduously Auto-Tuned singsongs. But that's the way most rappers sing, and he has learned to rap, as documented by how deftly this born comedian holds his own against Snoop Dogg in the opener, pitching hip-hop's underexploited little-bitch market with rhymes of true wit, speed, articulation, and rhythmic panache. As a born comedian, he of course risks offending, but there's plenty of cultural resonance on this double-disc official debut, especially as regards sex, about which it is detailed and proudly self-deprecating. As Lil Dicky's rap career progresses along with the album's narrative, the word ""girl"" fades as ""bitch"" asserts itself, and I believe he knows it, though not that he regards ""woman"" as an alternative. But he never gets to ""hoe,"" and throughout there are individual females in the relationships he details so loquaciously. ""White Crime"" is borderline offensive, ""$ave Dat Money"" no-holds-barred cheap. His parents' cameos are no-holds-barred droll. His reflections on the contradictions of his career path are smarter than he'll ever get credit for.

Title and label approximate. I prefer the other version of this ad hoc collection in my possession even though it slices the ends off tracks--it's louder, with hotter unmatched songs. But I'm reviewing this because it's obtainable online even with mixtape4u.com now drawing a blank. Look above Wayne's name on the cover image for ""The Empire,"" words that repeat in annoying voiceover ad infinitum; note also the Arabic three as opposed to the Roman numeral of the official release, which shares only a more casual ""La La La"" with this supposed leak. Skip it and you never hear the actually believable love plaint ""What He Does,"" the in-their-face Beatles rip ""Help,"" the celestially drugged-out ""I Feel Like Dying,"" or, for instance, ""I Know the Future"": ""Like a circle of knives/I got the sharpest flow around."" Granted, maybe it's the jaggedest flow around, or the underground stream that slices through rock to move mountains. But superlatives apply. Snicker-snack, snicker-snack, he can't contain himself, the rare modern pop artist who says he's in it for money but always gives up the love rather than vice versa.

From the start you know this is no mixtape because it's clearer and more forceful. Every track attends to detail, with fun tricks like the chipmunk-chorused ""Mr. Carter""'s sudden descent into screwed-and-chopped before Jay-Z comes in. But from the start Wayne worries about his image like a pop star, swearing he got shot for two songs running as if 50 was still worth a few bucks. Soon come the auto-T-Pained ""Lollipop"" follow-up ""Got Money"" and the soft slow jam ""Comfortable,"" as pro forma as his laziest thug jobs back when he was little. So it's call the doctor--""Dr. Carter"" himself, a rap-ologist complete with post-Yiddish ""acchh"" who will soon lose two impatient patients to their fakeness and his own do-as-I-say malpractice, followed by the space-tripping ""Phone Home"" and the N.W.A.-copping cop love of ""Mrs. Officer."" On ""Let the Beat Build,"" Kanye compensates for ""Comfortable"" with an off-the-cuff fusion of grandiose and primitive. Also mixtape-worthy is the bonus disc, previously known as the download-only The Leak EP.

Pretty rich, yet far from the finest lines on his best mixtape since ""The Carter III,"" and farther from the funniest. They're merely consecutive ones I could quote whole without distracting asterisks--the river of scat jokes, the garlands of garden tools, and the off-rhyme with ""grandma's cookies"" you'll have to transcribe on your own. Squinting at jail time and offering a welcome alternative to his underrated rock album, he recycles beats from Dirty South throwaways whose originals you need never think of again, shows Fabolous how fabulous the ""Throw It in the Bag"" remix might have been, holds his own with Jay-Z and the Black Eyed Peas, and eases the title onto every track.

In fact, I say it's progress that 11 of the 15 tracks here deploy the P-word the way God intended (as opposed to the p****-a**-n**** form, which I'd as soon he s***can myself). It suggests that, unlike most rappers and related pop lifeforms who brag about sex, Weezy really seems to savor it (especially--psst--oral--both ways!). Plus his posse cuts are finally showing some savor too, albeit not on the vestigial guns 'n' violence ones--the Gunplay collab is easily the dullest music here. Brightest: a pro-sex theme song featuring Drake and Future and called, officially, ""Love Me."" You want socially conscious themes? Really? A loose-lipped ship-sinker is what he was meant to be.

So now Arto flexes his connections and writes his own jazzboistic verse, and, well, there's nothing like a lyric you can understand. After leading with something about the colors of the sky that's way too sensitive for this reporter, the man sounds like the bedroom astronaut he says he is even when he's celebrating a superbright two-year-old on the most seductive song here--even when he reverts to Portugese.

Although he'll never make as much money at it as the samba masters he takes after, Lindsay's jeu d'esprit has turned modus operandi. He seems fully capable of an album like this every year or two: a dozen or so songpoems in English or Portuguese, floating by on the sinuous current and spring-fed babble of a Brazilian groove bent, folded, spindled, and mutilated by the latest avant-dance fads and electronic developments. The weak link is the poetry, which wouldn't be as fun as the music even if it was as well-realized.

Crank it up, and out of the trad percussion and futuristic programming leap Hiroshi Sunairi's performance-art vocal, Vernon Reid's acoustic guitar, Sandra Park's viola da gamba. Lyrics come clearer, too--especially in the translated Portuguese.

""Your time on earth is precious/Let's go fast and not go slow/Your time on earth is precious/Let's go high and not go low."" Pretty sensible as excited statements of musical purpose go, and we can't get too many of them these days. Because this Vietnamese-Chinese Copenhagener has plenty of spritz rhythmically and personally, she and her band's EP goes fast, four songs in 16 minutes, and aims high. Displaying more flow in English than many American-born Anglophones, she's always on top of the jingly M.I.A. style now designated grime by young people who believe pop electrohop stands in perpetual need of reclassification so they can own it. She's always beaty, always catchy, always cheeky. Not as deep as M.I.A., granted. But not as foolish, either.

The funk of these two black Brits is so light you could mistake it for 3-in-One oil at thirty yards and Pablo Cruise at fifteen. Well, don't. They're sly devils from the doorslam drums of ""Throw Away the Key"" to the slick antiliberal militance of ""Don't Get in My Way,"" and that's only side two. On side one they make clear that they've thought more about love than Pablo Cruise, who wouldn't know what to do with a steel drum if they got shipped home in one.

Former college sportswriter Todd Wilkinson didn't get to host K-Rock's syndicated Saturday-night mix show by pumping exotica. The interlocking beats and catchphrases of his first mix CD aren't what any Z-100 fan would call pop, but they're cheap, effective, and party-hearty enough to insure fun-fun-fun from beginning to end, which is more than Prodigy, the Chemical Brothers, or Fratboy Slim himself has managed. Having gotten our attention with the church-bell tune of Mike &amp; Charlie's ""I Get Live,"" he cedes the floor to Fratboy Slim for five minutes and we're off to the races. The ebullience flags as ass-shaking turns endurance contest, but never settles for the functionalist minimalism this supposedly hedonistic scene runs on. Compiling such an hour from the tens of thousands of hours of techno product out there ought to be easy. I've begun dozens of CDs that prove it isn't.

It would be nice to think Rick Estrin cares that his persona is an anachronism--that in 1995, the streetwise standard of automotive savoir-faire is the Lexus, not the Cadillac. But houserockin' bands are proud to be retro, so thank whomever there's one that doesn't stop at fleet solos and beer-soaked boogies. Estrin sings in the voice of a natural sophisticate whose day is made by a few pithy lines of well-chosen vernacular. He punctures phonies, rolls with the woman problems, has trouble buttoning his lip before his foot jumps in. And his best buddy is a guitarist who can play the blues and tell Charlie Parker jokes simultaneously.

The latest target of the black superman theory won't write history like Harold Cruse and spout Afrology like Robert Farris Thompson any more than Darryl Strawberry will act the mensch like Don Baylor and hit .330 like Rod Carew. That's not his job--leading an arena band is different, and plenty difficult. It's amazing enough for a jazz musician like Vernon Reid to make the transition to pop accessibility, proving that even art-rock can signify with the best album in that meaning-laden genre since Pink Floyd was in mourning. Though the striking choruses and fancy structures are pretty Euro, the proximate model is Bad Brains sans Jah. And though MTV's millions have heard Reid's more panhuman messages before, they've rarely heard them expressed so coherently--or by a black person. Both factors count for something.

The best thing about this excellent record is how hard it crunches. From the antiliberal ""Go Away"" to the propansexual ""Bi,"" the first four songs combine simplicity and smarts like no big-guitar music since vintage Aerosmith, and these smarts ain't stoopid. After that the songwriting dips some, although God knows they write about alienation as knowledgeably as any college-rock band. The weak link is Corey Glover, who still sings too well for his own good (cf. Jack Bruce). The fresh blood is Doug Wimbish, who still plays great (also cf. Jack Bruce).

Lillian Berlin is Johnny Rotten with politics. His art would be nothing without his rage; he's so possessed by the need to get his point across that he grabs his brothers' music by the throat and makes it bellow his tune. But his rage wouldn't be much without his analysis, which however simplistic--and it is, though at this perilous moment no more so than apolitical cynicism or liberal equivocation--gives shape, purpose, and a referent outside his tortured psyche to feelings that emanate from who knows where. A more balanced person would have gotten this cleansing full-length released in the U.S. last fall, when we needed it so much, but a more balanced person wouldn't have recorded it. The Berlins have bought it back from UniMoth, and maybe some patient U.S. bizzer will put it out eventually. Meanwhile, my advance is identical to the U.K. version, while the Japanese boasts two bonus cuts that'll cost you 12 bucks apiece. Like it says inside their EP: ""Just one enemy--The Exploiters.""

Sooner than I figured, given their anger management problems, a U.S. rejigger of the politically explosive Black Skies in Broad Daylight, which DreamWorks sat on nervously in explosive 2004. The new ""Bom Bom Bom"" is the pick of the seven songs involved in the substitution game played to sell mad fans the same record twice. But the deleted ""Standard Oil Trust"" is more than a good title. Sane fans will just have to do without.

Five years after this St. Louis brother band dropped their bomb, they drop their follow-up, and somehow--though kneejerk revolutionary Lillian Berlin has since had two kids with the director of his first video--they're still true believers in the cleansing if not excoriating power of rock and roll. Leading their theoretical followers into the streets in ""Brass Knuckles"" only to pine for ""the good life"" in ""Mercedes Marxist,"" they aim for a higher consistency: a collective grandeur that evokes AOR and punk simultaneously. Their retro is familiar in outline even though you can't name a single band who sound like them. Well, maybe the MC5 a little. But Rob Tyner was a blues-stud wannabe. Lillian murmurs his provocations from within a chorale.

From self-centered teenager to man with a mission: ""I hope to prove to the world that I can reach all materialistic goals and be young, black and legal."" On the cover he and his panther wear gold while his three women sport tight dresses and Moet, with not an Africa medallion in sight, but call it part of a larger strategy: justifying conspicuous consumption with conspicuous production. His output totals 16 tracks for 68 minutes on a single vinyl LP, with three extra on CD and the superhard B-side ""Jack the Ripper"" completing an 85-minute, 20-track cassette. Though one of the ballads is a killer, the other two are, well, changes of pace; the (vinyl) side-closers make ""Jack the Ripper"" sound slow; the arrogant sense of humor comes with a snide, irritating, completely original laugh. My standard response to such overkill is to wish someone had boiled it down to the great album it contains, but with this egocentric, hedonistic, workaholic materialist, I'll take it all--definitely including the nonvinyl ""Change Your Ways,"" which preaches compassion to the young, black, and legal competition.

DeJ rhymes with ""beige"" and is short for Deja; Loaf signals style and is short for her shoes. Although the girlish Detroit rapper's second mixtape was sparked by her fuck-you earworm ""Try Me,"" which used to cap it off but isn't on the one I bought two years late, I found her hammer-to-your-head manifesto for her ""unborn creations"" so irresistible that I never much missed it. It's the voice only that's girlish, clear and fluting although also calm and composed. The persona is more ""I'm gonna shit on all these bitches and their daughters,"" in that particular case echoed by a crew I bet she enlisted at a middle-school playground. What's irresistible is the form-content disparity--a rapper who brags so un-macho, a rapper whose greed is so explicitly for her family, a rapper who's ""Grindin'"" at music. Plus her flow is a brook, her producer respects her space, and her two sex rhymes are into it and into it more.

A studio group fabricated by superproducer Glyn Johns around the unbankable Andy Fairweather Low, they're really international men, but the conceit suits Andy somehow. His aphoristic colloquialism and cracked, unassumingly intense vocals carry everything on the record except the lovely, Lofgrenish ""Angels Falls,"" which belongs entirely to the second banana (and sometime Who keyb man) Tim Gorman, and the overblown, Springsteenish ""Shoot Out on the Highway,"" which must be somebody's idea of AOR.

FALSE,A-,As Good as Dead,Local H,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2099,"
Quintessential exponents of what the cynics at Spin call scrunge, these two young guys from Illinois are a study in the uses and limits of originality. After their debut proved only that singer-guitarist-bassist-headman Scott Lucas and drummer-dynamo Joe Daniels were to the bash-roil-howl born, they figured out enough about riffs and hooks to transform sound into song, and now evoke a tragic Seattle trio who shall remain nameless. I wish Pearl Jam, whose leader stars in the title song, packed such isometric power--that sense of tremendous force bravely exerted against implacable reality--and I say the exercise makes all of us stronger. Even if it develops further, which is about as unlikely as it having gotten this far, it will never replace the original. But these days we need any reassurance the music machine can cough up.

At first I was just glad to ascertain they weren't a fluke. Now I think they've gone and made themselves the straight rock album of the year. Their idea of roots Husker Du, their idea of avant-garde also Husker Du, they attack the 100-bpm four-four with a singleness of purpose unknown to rap-fearing new metalists, ska-loving old hardcorists, and indie adventurers adrift on the great unknown. They're not true believers, writing early and often about just how far straight rock can't take you. They address an audience they swear is still there. And they have something to prove, even if it's only that a duo from the same Illinois town that produced the Shoes can make more noise than a pumpkins-smashing factory.

The formal double-bind of the Delta blues these two students and near-contemporaries of Robert Johnson pursue so loyally isn't as constricting as that of the more recent Chicago style--there's no dated ""commercial"" formula, so attempts at progress aren't as likely to sound like awkward compromises. The acoustic duets, alternated (never shared) lead vocals, relaxed two-man horn arrangements, and funk-influenced drumming of their recording debut may read like a mishmash, but Shines's singing and songwriting fills in the holes for Lockwood, who has made unpretentious eclecticism a specialty for years.

Six titles, six composers (three singers, two guitarists, one drummer), each of which achieves the same HI-NRG with a different deployment of stripped-down resources (the aforementioned plus bass, synth, percussion, a two-man horn section, and the occasional female chorus). Sure it's all up-up-up. They'll take you there.

It's a conspiracy because it requires confederates. Without them, the trumpeting Klezmatic would lead one more blotto wedding band. Aided not just by such co-klezmerists as singing Klezmatic Lorin Sklamberg and singing Brave Old Worlder Michael Alpert but by a Brazilian drumming school and a Ukrainian avant-folksinger and nine Orthodox women set on defying the Orthodox ban on men hearing women sing, he unleashes track after track of internationalist anarchism. Lead elements shift, but every song partakes of the Eastern European breakout Gogol Bordello rocks so hard--and Gypsy-Jewish-Moorish myth London promotes so well.

Make-or-break is ""Sleeping Pills,"" when Brett Anderson drawls/whines/croons ""You're a water sign, and I'm an air sign"" so tunefully, repetitively, naggingly, inescapably that you swear he said ""I'm an asshole"" even though he pronounces ""air sign"" a lot more clearly than the line about Valium that follows. It's fingernail-on-blackboard city for anyone who doesn't believe Marc Bolan is Chuck Berry, and at first I couldn't stand it. Now it's a fave moment on this appropriately overhyped, surprisingly well-crafted coming out. More popwise and also more literary than the Smiths at a comparable stage, Suede's collective genderfuck projects a joyful defiance so rock and roll it obliterates all niggles about literal truth. If you think their victories over depression have nothing to do with you, be grateful you can make do with a report from the front.

It isn't just ""D--k in a Box"" and its explosive sequel ""J--z in My Pants."" Andy Samberg and his Berkeley homeboys are the funniest musical comedy act since Spinal Tap. Actual musicians help--world-beating T-Pain more than world-weary Julian Casablancas. So do other actors--foul Natalie Portman more than hammy Jack Black.

Here's a bonus DVD you'll want to waste a little time with. Funny thing is, though, some of these songs are funnier without the videos that are their reason for being. The Mr. Softee boasts of ""We're Back!"" need no visualization in a musical mode that's pumped phallocentric nonsense since Eazy-E was a woman beater, and ""I Just Had Sex"" seems less pathetic than it deserves when you glom the hotties who are putting bags over our antiheroes' heads. Then again, the over-the-top ""Motherlover"" is cut down to size when you glom its confident middle-aged sex objects, whereas Michael Bolton's ""Jack Sparrow"" feature falls flat without the movie takeoffs you can only find online. Parody is hard to sustain. That this follow-up provides so many laughs without flailing around in can-you-top-this? is a tribute to the comedians' musicality and their musician friends' sense of comedy.

Reminding us that gangsters are an old story in the entertainment business, impressionistic beatmaster samples multiple subnoir flicks with occasional Bogart for a touch of class. The verbal content is murmured by an L.A.-based Flying Lotus subaltern constantly off kilter and on point: ""Kept the spirit like K-Fed/Now I'm aiming with the crossbow off with his head/Running jewels with the Pro-Keds/We wanna run from the man for the street cred."" So yes, there's a message, laugh lines too. Homeboy Sandman gets a 16. But the pull is musical, particularly the way L'Orange's rhythms shift texturally as well as temporally--every minute, new effects daub and stipple the groove. Although lighter in tone and bottom, it had me going back to Ghost Dog. Hip-hop soundtracking doesn't get more evocative than that.

Only indie perverts would hyperventilate over Lord's breathy voice, which needs every booster jet mind can devise or money can buy. And only indie perverts would object to her long-aborning major-label debut, where she gets the help she needs. The production is Amy Rigby-style neotraditionalism, with Roger McGuinn rippling under one flowing surge just to mark the concept, and, overcoming her fondness for Nick Saloman (Bevis Frond, don't you know anything?), she makes the most of covers from Elizabeth Cotten to Freedy Johnston. Equally impressive, every once in a while she finds the gumption to eke out a song so winsomely conceived and solidly constructed it belongs in the canon she adores. Sometimes Saloman even helps--the cowritten lead track is a hummer worthy of Stuart Musgrove (Belle and Sebastian, don't you know anything at all?).

Although he doesn't have the voice to ape Cassius Clay or picong-wrestle with Sparrow, he does have the lyrics. A good half of these songs abound in calypso's outrageously observed hyperbole, and his failures with women are a relief from the usual BS even if they're hyperbole too. As for ""Crazy Love"" and ""My Baby Is All Right,"" well, they don't merely justify his sobriquet--they make you think maybe this plug-ugly cared more for women than his better-endowed rivals. I still covet his gibberish-German Hitler farewell, not to mention the original of Harry Belafonte's ""Mama Look at Boo Boo."" But the compilation he deserves might as well be this one.

You must know that today's pop gets a lot more pretentious than this, and a lot deader, thus testifying to the perfection of your match. Pretty sharp for Cardiff U kids--Raymond Williams would be proud (I hope). Do they really dance to ""You! Me! Dancing!"" in Wales? They'd better, since it lasts six minutes and claims, credibly, that you yourself ""can't dance a single step."" Which, right, you also hoped I'd quote.

Spawned by the steady old Cuarteto Patria, the most renowned of Santiago de Cuba's dozens of son ensembles, this young quintet hypes things up--leads keener, harmonies tenser, percussion busier, guitar more intrusive.

At first I suspected tokenism or worse, but that's because the solid craftsmanship of a committed club band only gathers full impact at LP length. Once I saw them--felt them, really, in my bones more than my soul--the suspicion that maybe hip white Angelenos were working off Chicano guilt never entered my mind again. I just wondered whether there weren't more where they came from, and decided that finding competitors of equal chops, breadth, and reach would be pretty tough, especially with young Mexican-Americans so heavily into metal. Good old rock and roll East L.A. style, with a lope Doug Sahm fans will recognize long before Joe ""King"" Carrasco fans.

These guys are a world-class band. If they want to go Motown, who wouldn't? If they want to downplay the accordion, they have the guitars to compensate. But if they think pop means compassionate generalizations after the manner of John Cougar Mellencamp, they're selling themselves short. Though they're less confused for sure, with a gift for snapshot images that suggest the dimensions of suffering in this trouble land of ours, only on ""The Hardest Time"" do they drive that suffering all the way home. Leaving us with world-class jukebox grooves and vocals and some affecting protest songs.

This Paris-rerecorded compilation of top tunes by Cuba's top band is tasteful like Sesame Street rather than Masterpiece Theatre, stealing wittily from commercial culture rather than embalming good ideas in respectability.

Catchy, simplistic, ramming home the clave, not shy of syndrums or syn-anything else, Los Van Van are the class of Castro-era Cuban pop. I still prefer Mango's rerecorded Songo, where four of the great hits here got richer, longer, and an elegant touch slower. But these cheesy '70s originals are the golden oldies of underdevelopment. Sometimes their high spirits seem forced, and sometimes their forced quality seems a mark of distinction, like the ingrown musical resources Juan Formell and his comrades had no choice but to make something new of.

Like James Brown in the '70s, they record too much. But if the Duke Ellington Orchestra was this vital after 30 years on the boards, it didn't showcase the new songs to prove it. Find the right section of any large metropolitan record store and the array of Los Van Van titles will make you dizzy; for those of us without Spanish on our tongues and Latino in our marrow, they blur together. But I've never heard a compilation that didn't reconfigure my cerebellum, and on this '94-'97 selection I note that, remarkably, the remakes are on average slightly less memorable than the newer compositions--which is not to suggest that the one that crowned the last show I caught, the Yoruba-based ""Soy Todo,"" was truly new whenever it was written.

Determined to become the thinking man's David Sanborn by hook or by crook, John Lurie swallows his indignation and elects to market himself--you achieve retail access by dialing the label name on your home telephone. And dial you might. His tone is as rich as his tunes, his solos are lifelike, his musicians thrive as individuals, his musicians function as a unit, and his arty moves kick in with a satisfying thwock. As usual, free jazz meets Henry Mancini meets Kurt Weill meets Peter Gordon meets the Ramada Inn. But the pomo patina has worn away--he's lyrical and catchy rather than ""lyrical"" and ""catchy.""

""Art-rock,"" sneers my wife, who's never heard it before. ""Movie music,"" Greil Marcus recalls fondly. ""I just played it this week,"" R. Meltzer tells me--and then places its release in early 1968 because it came out the day before a well-remembered abortion. All wrong. It came out November 1967, and neither art-rock nor movie music, no matter how fondly recalled, will permit a song that begins with an elegantly enunciated ""Oh, the snot has caked against my pants/It has turned into crystal."" Arthur Lee was always too oblique for his own good. Here he counterposes a background-music feel and a delightful panoply of studio effects against his own winning skepticism and the incipient Jaggerishness of his pseudo-Johnny Mathis vocals. Perhaps because it retains so much humor, his battle cry--""We're all normal and we want our freedom""--hasn't dated, the melodies really hang in there, and only Steely Dan has ever attempted a record so simultaneously MOR and anti-MOR.

Fired on the opening cut by some lead guitar from special guest Jimi Hendrix, the first side is new funk at its best: complex, carnal, and crazy. Arthur Lee has never sung so soulfully, and while new guitarist Gary Rowles ain't Hendrix, he's willing to fake it. Side two gets poppier, with fey moments that aren't up to what Lee has accomplished in that mode before. But since that's as much as anybody, big deal.

But rhymewise--contentwise--they're just getting started. Connected to the street and her family's front steps, Monie's shtick is proud rather than hostile, as in ""R U Single,"" where she sees through a casanova's bullshit to what's ""cute and smart"" about him. She radiates sisterhood even though she concentrates on the guys, and positivity and tradition even though her only political/cultural move is ""Swiney Swiney,"" the most disgusting antimeat song you ever heard.

What they can tell us about is the persistence of punk. Unlike the Hives, who I bet they look down on, they're avant formalists as opposed to pop formalists, twisting funky drumming and weird guitar. Love them for getting excited about these time-honored usages.

FALSE,A-,A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night,Love Is All,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14271,"
As intense one of those hummingbirds that consume twice their own weight every day, Josephine Olausson makes being tiny a virtue. She wants it all, which scares her half to death--her multiple paranoias provide an album title. But tune and tempo conquer all even if love doesn't, and soon, if you listen up, you'll hear her toss her head and move on, jubilant in her capacity for jubilation. Well past thirty now, she's one of those happy punks--in art and, one hopes, in life.
"
FALSE,A-,Two Thousand and Ten Injuries,Love Is All,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14968,"
As a punk-loving music journo with a sense of humor, Josephine Olausson is definitely my type. Cute, too. But I'm already taken--and also, I admit, way too old for her. So I was genuinely tickled for her when an opener entitled ""Bigger, Bolder"" started, ""Faster, harder--my love for you,"" and touched down on a dozen superlatives before it was done cycling through its guitar hooks 2:12 later. But the very next track she was all, ""You know that this will never last,"" and then the next one repeated the same last four words as she, well, ran away. Sigh--she is paranoid, as her last album explained in wondrous detail, and hence maybe not my type after all. On the other hand, there are many more male jerks than female jerks, and most of the latter are annoying at best about their fears. Olausson is funny and candid and multi-hooked and--if her delivery means anything, which this being music rather than life it does--indomitable. So much so that she and her guys have now delivered three straight albums of precisely that description.

FALSE,A-,Stateless,Lene Lovich,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2031,"
It took me half a year to get through my head what an original Lovich is. Women who know how to say when, while not unheard of in rock, tend to come on macho--tough mamas with hearts (and heads) as soft as Papa Hemingway's. But Lovich's goofy energy doesn't distract her from her feelings or damage her sex appeal or conceal a mawkish underside. And although it took an outsider to define her in a ditty (""Say When,"" which isn't on the import), Lovich does provide her own love song, which has integers in it.

So what happened to John Sebastian, anyway? Was it the drug busts, the drugs themselves, group hassles, mob-based management? All these and more, but listening back to this slight improvement on Rhino's Anthology, I infer something more fundamental. Figure the reason no one was better at translating the flowery optimism of the middle '60s into folk-flavored pop song--""Do You Believe in Magic,"" ""You Didn't Have to Be So Nice,"" ""Daydream,"" ""Summer in the City,"" ""Rain on the Roof,"" just look at those titles--was as much spirit as talent. Figure he was so eager, so well-meaning, so fun-loving, so warmhearted, such a simpleton, that when the times demanded cynicism this John--unlike natural-born reprobate Phillips or designated reality principle Lennon--didn't have it in him. The three-four-five dogs among this album's 26 selections barely slow down its historical mission of evoking the balmy upsurge to the Summer of Love like no other body of music.

The great originals--keynoted by the title song, which commenced their 1965-66 run of seven straight top 10 singles--are all on the best-of. But on their debut album the filler was prime too, because unlike the Dylan-chiming Byrds, their folk-rock revved a jug-band strain that was plenty lively to begin with. Their ""Blues in the Bottle"" owed the Holy Modal Rounders and contended with them. And on the best bonus track, Will Shade sneaks away from Beale Street to mastermind the Hollywood Argyles.

Low may be wide-eyed and legless, but I wouldn't compete with him over the long haul--he's got staying power. What he sees is often connected to the downs and ups of the biz, but because his metaphors are vernacular and his attack allusive his songs sound like the outcries of anyone who's ever felt outclassed, outcast, outranked, or outraged by the money boys. And although he's half-way to everything, he never whines or comes on as a misunderstood artist--just swallows it all but his pride. And then jumps up and turns around.

The anthem here is ""Shit Shower &amp; Shave,"" in which scuzzballing Adam Weiner explains how ""cleanliness is godliness"" for a guy embarking on his quest for nocturnal emission, especially if he aspires to better than the handjob-for-hire of the album title. Less mannered here than on his pseudo-doowop project Ladyfingers (lady fingers? do we detect a fetish?), Philadelphian Weiner and some Brits with nothing better to do churn out a resolute rock and roll whose joyless momentum and stubborn little tunes will tell you more than you want to know about the pursuit of pleasure in America's deader downtowns and strip malls. My guess is that he romanticizes this pursuit some, perhaps because he believes the alternatives are measurably worse. You don't have to share his cynical sentiments. But there's a bitter pleasure in hearing his point.

Trying to make ends meet as the bar band of their dreams, they add muscle to their sound and lose a smidgen of edge in their writing. But that doesn't stop them from preserving 15 songs for posterity instead of the 10 they settled for on their equally self-financed debut. Adam Weiner shouldn't feel obliged to prove he's got big ballads in him, and ""Cleveland"" proves it. Right afterwards, fortunately, the final five tracks turn out to be where the edge takes over: two simultaneously lively and soulful Dan Finnemore love songs and three Weiner numbers, one stranger than the next and all redolent of a piano man's bar-band life. ""Scoliosis in Secaucus"" breaks up the love songs. The low-key voice-and-guitar envoi ""Dreams Don't Come True"" speaks for itself and Frank Sinatra. And done as a final-call blues, ""(No More) Wet T-Shirt Contest"" is Weiner's most twisted fable of the down-and-dirty life to date: ""I feel like my Christian phase is comin'/My fans are gettin' pretty bored/But meanwhile I just keep on hummin'/Here in the bosom of the Lord.""

Fourteen tracks recap the two great albums of 1978 and 1979, when he declared himself pure pop and spelled out the sound of breaking glass--roadie with arm torn off, actress eaten by dog. The remaining thirteen cull from the six good albums of the subsequent decade, when the fringe professional proclaimed a ""Lovers Jamboree."" The rowdy songs know whereof they kick, ""Stick It Where the Sun Don't Shine"" wounds all heels, and every decent half-boy/half-man has a couple of good love songs in him--""Heart"" pure pop, ""Raging Eyes"" true romance.

The latest old fart to slip into limbo and come back to play another day, Nick the Knife is a writer again, every song honed and there for a reason. With the likes of Ry Cooder and Jim Keltner spiking his wry cool, he yearns for yen, makes Boeing a modest proposal, spins off pungent epithets (""Refrigerator White""), nonsense syllables (""Shting-Shtang""), sexual metaphors (""Honeygun""). In a shameless bid for the rockcrit vote, he also finds the perfect rhyme for ""ghastly"" (starts with ""Rick,"" lest you already forgot). And just like with Labour of Lust in 1979, he makes it sound so easy you expect a reprise a year for the rest of his life.

FALSE,A-,Hungry for Stink,L7,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1978,"
Always a song band, they reverse the usual evolution by slathering themselves with grunge, which they play for weird sounds rather than dull despair. Hence their anger seems more metal-generic than punk-programmatic--rooted in the rock and roll everyday, where it belongs. It should go without saying that it's often about gender nevertheless; how anyone can accuse them of riding a bandwagon is beyond me. Every day, women is what they are, and there are lots of ways that can be shitty--the rape avoidance diary ""Can I Run"" describes only a few. But every day, rock and rollers is also what they are, and they're much better at it than Candlebox or Alice in Chains. And yes, the songs help.

Divested of Jennifer Finch's liberal conscience, bad girls Donita Sparks and Suzy Gardner are she-cats with a bitch's vocabulary, yowling and whining the basics: ""Me, Myself and I,"" ""I Need,"" ""Must Have More.""

""Femininity is sensitivity with a light, delicate touch. But femininity is also intensity when it comes from four fine hard-rocking ladies--L7."" So intones a menacing Donita Sparks to kick off the 1992 Radio Brisbane performance that precedes a 1990 Detroit show on disc two, both of which show off this feminist song band's equal commitment to feedback-drenched aggro. Basically a lotta noise with tunes buried in it, I've come to dig their ballroom blitz as much as disc one's winning array of stray live and tribute-record covers: not just the Runaways' ""Cherry Bomb"" but Willie Nelson's ""Three Days,"" not just the Dead Kennedys' ""Let's Lynch the Landlord"" but Ray Barretto's ""El Watusi."" This 2016 double-CD was released to whip up word-of-mouth for a comeback expected to generate a new album that has yet to materialize beyond a single that doesn't live up to the title ""Dispatch from Mar-a-Lago.""  Get it while you can if you can.

Delicate, nimble, tripping the light fantastic where Diblo Dibala and Syran M'Benza peal and billow, he is nevertheless delighted to feature each on a different three of these nine tracks. Generic Franco-Zairean at its most beguiling--the kind of record that makes you want to get serious about unlocking your pelvic girdle.

FALSE,A-,Music From Max Fleischer Cartoons,Gary Lucas' Fleischerei Featuring Sarah Stiles,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16764,"
The master guitarist's avant-garde playmates have included Stampfel, Pulnoc, Beefheart, the Beefheart repertory band Fast 'N' Bulbous, and bigger weirdos than that. So for him, this re-creation of pre-Code animator Max Fleischer's leggy sexpot-ingenue Betty Boop is a pop move. Lucas ups the musical ante, of course--while respecting the cinematic idiom, his Gibson acoustic and Sesame Street music director Joe Fiedler's trombone prod an active rhythm section as everyone adds more spritz and oomph than would have made sense in a moviehouse. Lucas also plays both a Queens-accented Popeye and a rough-and-gruff Barnacle Bill in the six-minute ""Beware of Barnacle Bill"" transcription that closes. But the star of the show is Broadway find Sarah Stiles, who adds weight, sass, and flesh-and-blood nuance to the cartoonish squeals of the great Mae Questel, who brought Betty to musical life nearly a century ago.

Although I enjoy an endless groove as much as the next Afropop fan, my Afropop-inflected taste in grooves means that when it comes to British dance music, I prefer my beatmakers rockish. So it finally is with Luke Blair, who on his fourth and least austere album ventures into songlike territory without ever enlisting a vocalist, although vocal sounds do enter the mix. The first three tracks evoke a Madchester DOR approach, only Blair's fuzzed-up, uninhibited textures, the first two incorporating treated chorales, have more character than most of the wasted singers on that scene. Subsequently, different sonic sets front each track. One thumps, one arpeggiates, one twinkles, one loops atmospheric, one loops bassy, and so forth. It's almost as if Blair has called in has-beens for cameos--here Otis Clay, there, I don't know, Brett Anderson. Not exactly, though.

I also like his perspective on his own bad character--a record that begins ""You can never give/The finger to the blind"" can't get too serious, or too nice. I like how the drummer pushes the music away from the slough of despond. And of course I like the guitar, which is pretty and ugly in all the right places.

More than a stopgap, by addition (one guitar) and subtraction (one superscript 2). Who cares if the best cut on the EP is the best cut on the LP and the three runners-up are all covers--Velvets/Dream Syndicate/Beat Happening, yet. Every song is good, and several are fast.

Within the cushy parameters of the smoothness that is Dean Wareham's spiritual discipline, this sonic construction is all stakes and clothesline, relishing the jerrybuilt almost as much as Penthouse did the luxurious. It's still hooky pop as well-savored guilty pleasure, still undercut by Wareham's pleasantly alienated lyrics. But voice and guitars sound more, well, tentative (get it?). Having given his all to the marketplace and stood there bemused as they gave him Smashing Pumpkins back, he isn't throwing in the towel yet. But damned if he's going to hire a cleaning service just to have people over for drinks.

Once it seemed they'd roll out good songs in perpetuity, then that they'd struggle competently till near misses did them part. Now it's talent will out. The best of these seven songs is a Stones cover, only not by as much as you first think, and the second-best is the opener, ditto. Later a teenager hypnotizes a pancake while getting a girl to stick his hand down her did-he-say-pants.  Later a guitar instrumental justifies the title ""Drunken Whistler."" Later there's an alibi, a song that namechecks New Haven, and a guitar instrumental that justifies the title ""Neon Lights"" until a lyric takes over the job.

I have a rule against stealing adjectives, but annotator Girt Friedrich's ""silvery"" is just too perfect for this serious, light-voiced Gypsy queen of Bucharest's suburban weddings. The language barrier only brings her mellow soprano to the fore. Augmented by the acrobatic lautari who manned Romania's state-owned Electrecord studios through the '80s, her white witchcraft has a swiftness that holds up against the black magic of her great rival, Romica Puceanu. Goodness seems to be Lunca's calling. When Ceaucescu fell and sin became legal again, she retreated into the Pentecostal church, where she's still singing as she turns 70.

Fake jazz was all well and good, but fake tango? With world music already functioning as dinner music and background music here in the nonworld, why art it up with an extra layer of secondhand knowingness? Inconveniently, however, I liked the Lounge Lizard's bandoneon features, and my middle-aged friends kept asking what they were. Exactly how tango it all is I couldn't tell you, although Alfredo Pedernara would appear to be the genuine article and the four others would appear to be old friends of Evan. But compared to his choppy first efforts for Argentina's favorite accordion on 1988's import-only Pieces for Bandoneon, the new melodies flow with an ease that transcends the idiomatic. Must be world music. Also dinner music. And pleasantly acerbic background music too.

Owen Bradley steals a trick from Andrew Loog Oldham here even if he never heard of the fella--like Flowers, this is a ""concept album"" conceived largely to recycle old material, and like Flowers it works anyway. No cover filler or publishing tie-ins, just the continuing saga of a strong-willed woman committed to a male-defined world. In most of these pungently colloquial songs (punch line of ""You Wanna Give Me a Lift"": ""But this ole gal ain't goin' that far""), Lynn is either boasting or telling somebody off, and even when she's addressing herself to a woman, what's got her excited is a man--her man, for better or (usually) worse.

Each (short) side closes off with the obligatory domestic bromide. But the other nine songs--including six by the singer and two by Shel Silverstein--embody Lynn's notion of female liberation. This notion isn't very sisterly--the only other woman who appears here is headed for Fist City--but does break through the male-identified dead ends of a Tammy Wynette. If Loretta doesn't get her love rights, then she's gonna declare her independence, and even scarier for her man, she sounds like she's itching for an excuse. You know about funky? Well, then, call this spunky.

Two historic performances, Carrie Underwood's cornpone-deluxe ""You're Lookin' at Country"" and a Lambert-Crow-Lynn trifecta taking the title song home, counterbalance cocky ones by the matched pair Jack White and Kid Rock. Both are guys, as you may have noticed, so let me note that Alan Jackson and Steve Earle distinguish themselves as the duet partners they're proud to be. This isn't just a women's record, it's a sisterhood record--not even the ever more stylized Lucinda Williams tries to upstage the artist who did more than Kitty Wells herself to make all these gals' artistic lives possible. Lynn still owns the songs, but she's pleased as pie to lend them out, and they come back to her lovingly countrified even when the borrower is Hayley Williams, of Paramore and Franklin, Tennessee, who acts naturally over an acoustic guitar and should give Jack White lessons.

Epistemologically, one tough cookie. A trailer-trash blonde as down-home-and-crazy as George Jones who cut five country albums on the strength of a voice that turned out to have nothing on her writing, Lynne radiates roots signifiers. Yet though her music avoids all shows of pomo dissociation, the harder you listen the more rootless her mix-and-match rock-etc. sounds. Even more than, speak of the devil, Garth Brooks, she's a creature of the recording industry and the smorgasbord-of-the-air it's laid out everywhere. Are the emotions she displays so pithily as synthetic in the end as her harmonica-with-strings or steel/slide guitar? Does that make them less real? Do she or her fans want to know?

Great formula here. When it rocks, three guitarists and a keyboard player pile elementary riffs and feedback noises into dense combinations broken by preplanned solos, while at quieter moments the spare vocabulary of the best Southern folk music is evoked or just plain duplicated. And any suspicions that this substantial, tasteful band blew their best stuff on the first platter should fall in the wake of the first state song ever to make top ten, which will expose you to their infectious putdowns of rock businessmen, rock journalists, and heroin.

But on the other, Ronnie Van Zant has never deployed his limited, husky baritone with such subtlety. Where Gregg Allman (to choose a purely random example) is always straight, shuttling his voice between languor and high emotion, Van Zant feints and dodges, sly one moment and sleepy the next, turning boastful or indignant or admonitory with the barest shifts in timbre.

Nor is that all--the five new titles include a Bay Area praisesong, a motormouth ""capping"" dis, and just one too many showcases for LB's quasi-operatic helpmate Joyo Velarde.

Exuberant and extravagant if gravelly at times, chanted more than sung because Tom Shimura is a rapper, this major funk vocalist's sixth solo studio album celebrates life the hedonistic way. Its first four tracks praise sex as chocolate cake, bling that includes a stegasaurus skeleton and some sasquatch fur, the girl from first-period English who turned him out, and the beauty of difference. But it also embraces life the conscious way. ""Can't Lose My Joy"" distills his wife Joyo Velarde's long, frightening triumph over non-Hodgkins lymphoma. The double-reversed James Brown cover adds that question mark to ""This Is a Man's World?"" for the best of reasons. And we'll call the unlisted bonus track ""Arrest the President"" because it begins by chanting that phrase 14 times before cataloguing shortcomings that include his small penis.

Ever since I encountered Ma (on Sesame Street, since you ask), he's been my classical crossover guy of choice. His freedom from smarmy noblesse oblige is typified by his approach to repertoire--he accords bluegrass and tango the same modest respect he does Bach and Tan Dun, never showboating for some ill-imagined gallery. Master tunesmith Bach gets three tracks on this subtly sequenced best-of, New York-raised Astor Piazzolla and bluegrass crossover guy Mark O'Connor two apiece, and even the John Williams ringer sounds OK when Ma is adoring the melody on his rhymes-with-mellow, although the orchestration is to barf at. This is the best of the European humanism the classical elite so often falsifies, reifies, and wills to power--not just beautiful and reassuring, useful attributes these days, but tolerant, curious, democratic. Just like me for giving it a shot.

""My voice was always very loud but very thin,"" so this border Tukolor bulked up his God-given instrument with the same conscious discipline that enabled him to attend law school and penetrate Wolof Dakar. But as with so many ambitious young men from the provinces, there's always been an awkwardness about him, and his Chris Blackwell-backed attempts to follow Youssou N'Dour and Salif Keita into the so-called world music market have been cluttered with horns, stabs in the dark, and invited guests. The shows have varied, too, but this four-cuts-in-40-minutes EP is the heart of a good one. It's got a montuno-driven salsa. It's got reggae universalist Ernest Ranglin in Tukolor drag.

But like both it avoids the intelligent compromises with which Maal has attracted some non-African listeners and disoriented others, and the concept works.

The most compelling and beautiful of West Africa's ever-increasing stock of folkloric preservations is a 1984 collaboration between two Tukulors, an ex-law student and a blind griot. Brit reviews suggest a cult record on the order of Mystï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""timeless, resilient and dignified,"" ""mesmeric, stately and gently stirring,"" ""gentle, cyclical,"" ""transfix and hypnotise,"" and oh yes, ""on permanent repeat."" For postindustrialized listeners, the interplay of recurring guitar patterns and penetrating Afro-Islamic voices adds up to background music with soul, nearly an hour of it on CD--in a quiet mood, we can still the world's sorrow by immersing in it. There's no point denying that it's valid as such. But my pleasure is dimmed slightly by the knowledge that the title track, for instance, is about young Tukulors forced by colonial borders and encroaching drought to seek work far from the roots the music celebrates. Seems a tad exploitative to bend such specifics to my own needs. At the very least I'd welcome a trot.

Ewan's pride was always a folkie in her bones, a singer whose acute arrangements were dulled by prefunk grooves. That's why the sauciest songs on her Galore best-of sound a little fusty, and also why this Latin-inspired and -flavored return to the studio seemed like nothing to get worked up about. (Remember Rei Momo? By David Byrne? Right.) Making no claims for the clave of her same old Brit backing guys, she soars like she never has anyway. She always had attitude, but whether she's stalking a fan gone ""to a record store/To buy a CD by some other girl not me"" or walking all over some Limey masochist in her most impractical shoes, these songs are so loose and raunchy they live the carnival cliche of life-giving rhythm ""Mambo de la Luna"" stakes its video on. The saxophone-and-autoharp finale is a return to foggy London town even though most of the album takes place there, the non-Latin bonus tracks are letdowns, and MacColl's death in the Caribbean last December hurts every time she ai-yi-yis about what a slut she turned out to be.

Fuckin' right he's still alive, and without stooping to abstinence, either. He abuses any substance you got, addresses love bitter love with the unexampled expertise of a snaggle-tooth who might have fucked your missis but never fucked your daughter, bawls catchy tone-deaf tunes, and entrusts his life to the Church of the Holy Spook. The only great Pogues album was Rum Sodomy and the Lash, 10 years ago. This is the next best thing.

Seven songs instead of eight or nine, with room for dub codas that wore thinner for me than they will for the dancehall-friendly. But the songs themselves don't quit--the disses drop science, ""Unemployment Blues"" gets down to business, ""Proud To Be Black"" sticks to the proud facts of that overburdened theme. And ""Drink Too Much"" fulfills the wondrous promise of its brief, eloquent spoken intro: ""Now you have some people feel dem idea of a good night out is to go to the pub, drink 15 pints of lager, and then vomit.""

He's too big to talk revenge, not unlike his hero Nelson Mandela--even when he's boosting melanin, he thinks it's a shame his oppressors turn the color of watermelon out in the sun. There are a lot of rhymes here because he has a lot to say, and just in case you think the truth is always neat, a lot of the rhymes are charged with dissonant synth splats. The motormouth insults of ""Get Rid of Maggie"" are fit company for ""Stand Down Margaret"" or ""Madame Medusa"" or ""Tramp the Dirt Down."" When the nearest thing to a low point is a sweet Mandela tribute that steals a chorus from Curtis Mayfield, you're up there.

FALSE,A-,This Unruly Mess I've Made,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16880,"
Since the only bad thing I know about this diligent, talented, sincere Evergreen College alum is his post-""Thrift Shop"" stage gear, I consider his critical disrepute a disgrace to my vocation. Although clearly no cash-in or rush job, his second album gathered 17 Metacritic reviews averaging a pitiful 59, the most bewildering a sympathetic Pitchfork piece that could have been a 79 as easily as the 51 some asshole stuck on it. The three by black writers went 76, 75, and 50, which I mention because Macklemore's whiteness has been a cause celebre ever since he apologized for the rap Grammy The Heist snatched from good kidd m.A.A.d city. Yes, he's white, and his suburban drawl and choppy flow sound that way, although not Lewis's pop hooks, grand flourishes, and schooled piano. But just because he candidly embodies the awkwardness and contradictions in which white privilege embroils every Caucasian who isn't a flat-out racist, he makes white people uncomfortable, and they should stop blaming him for it. Beyond two preachy substance-abuse numbers, this is consistently fun, interesting, or both. The Anderson Paak. romp ""Dance Off,"" the Melle Mel/Kool Moe Dee joke-boast ""Downtown,"" the tonsorial joke-boast ""Brad Pitt's Cousin,"" and the corny one for his little girl are unpretentious enough to justify the much-dissed 8:46 finale ""White Privilege,"" which has more content than the twice-and-done Tupac feature you never play on To Pimp a Butterfly.

These Anglo lads have failed to click Stateside because they offer nothing to snobs and because they're so Anglo they only connect when they hit a song on the nose. Though I doubt they'll ever approach the jaunty excitement of their debut again, the hits here compiled come as close as an open-minded Americna could ask to solving the second problem. Their compassion and common sense are as jolly and traditional and working-class as their ska, which edges ever closer to polka and music hall. And jolly though they may be, they see a lot of pain.

In case you bought the con, disco never died--just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde is one of them, and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her tummy--essence of electro, the D in DOR. At first I thought the electroporn twelve-inch that pairs ""Burning Up"" with ""Physical Attraction"" was the way to go, but that was before she'd parlayed the don't-let-me-down vagueness of ""Borderline"" into a video about interracial love (sex, I mean) and a sneaky pop hook simultaneously. At one stiff per four-song side, smarter than Elvis Costello.

Only two of the seven songs on her best LP haven't surfaced on an earlier album, but it's no best-of, and not just because she's saving her radio hits for yet another compilation. The effects, repeats, breaks, and segues added by a star crew of remixers headed by Jellybean Benitez and Shep Pettibone amount to new music--this time the songs don't surface, they reach out and grab you.

Forget the four ""Deluxe"" extras, not one of which except maybe the pretty little ""I Fucked Up"" improves on the updated '90s arena-dance power tracks of the first 43 minutes, although they top the deadly-dreamy closer ""Falling Free"" as well as the penultimate ""Masterpiece,"" which begins ""If you were the Mona Lisa . . . ."" Granted, I could mock ""Ooh la la you're my superstar/Ooh la la that's what you are"" just as easily. But lyrics have never been where she showed off her gorgeous brains, and anyway, the 10-track mix I propose as an alternative goes out on a real song called ""Love Spent"": ""Hold me like your money/Tell me that you want me/Spend your love on me/Spend your love on me."" Nikki Minaj shines bright, but she's no more crucial structurally than the cheerleaders who garnish ""I'm Addicted"" at its close and embellish ""Give Me All Your Luvin'"" throughout. Play loud.

As for Doom, well: ""One scary night I saw the light/Heard a voice like Barry White/Said, 'Sure you're right.'"" To emulate neither Barry White, the voice means, nor the kind of quick thinker who normally rhymes ""fine, G,"" ""hiney,"" ""Chinee,"" ""shiny,"" and ""pine tree."" Instead Doom sounds slow, probably because he's stoned. He loves rhyme so much that the only universe that suits him is one where a gutter ball leads straight to a butterball--and that is a stoned universe.

Reflecting a recording budget rumored to have risen by as much as $450, Stephin Merritt's craft shines brightly half the time--the song that mentions the Beach Boys actually feigns happiness. Just as important, his largely theoretical group starts to resemble a band--although cheap synth rhythms remain their thing, the banjo, flute, and ukulele are felt as unique sound, not just arch affectation. Here and there, you'd even swear Merritt is singing about his own feelings. How'd he ever come up with that?

How amusing they prove over time remains, of course, to be determined. Most amusing: ""Your Girlfriend's Face"" and ""I'll Go Anywhere With Hugh"" (tie). Most--sorry, it's the right word--soulful: ""Andrew in Drag."" I note for the record that all three are among the first five tracks.

You know the drill. Five 10-song CDs that'd fit onto two, and thereby cost less than 40 bucks, with each year of Merritt's life allotted one song and each decade one CD as neatly as 69 Love Songs's three 23-song discs add up to that magic number. But this edition of the Magnetic Fields is barely a band--with occasional aid from Thomas Bartlett, Daniel Handler, and scattered others, Merritt plays over 100 instruments all told and assigns every lead vocal to his own depressive bass. Aptly autobiographical though 'tis, this is a negative, especially on disc two, which also honors John Foxx of Ultravox, who Merritt loved as a teenager and admires today--musically, there are numerous dead spots. Over the medium haul, however, every song is a grower, not merely because Merritt is quite a lyricist but because he's documenting an exceptional life that includes a childhood in a panoply of hippie communes and a young adulthood in a hodgepodge of bohemian penury. And some songs you'll connect with right away. Among my candidates: three-year-old loving a cat who hates him, five-year-old internalizing a Grace Slick rant, 13-year-old upgrading a duo called 1 1/2 into a trio who make the Shaggs sound like Yes, college man failing ethics, college grad loving Ethan Frome, twentysomething enjoying a live-in four-way, thirtysomething XXX-ing his ex, and fortysomething reaccessing a permanently impermanent NYC. But especially, 50-year-old kissing off the most horrendous of his stepfathers and 50-year-old emoting what kinda sounds like a love song.

Taj hasn't used drums on a record since Happy Just to Be Like I Am, but he rocks so easy it took me till now to notice. On ""Little Red Hen"" he matches the Pointer Sisters strut for strut, and though that's the only great one he also renews ""Dust My Broom"" and ""Frankie and Albert,"" earns a medal from fat liberation by reviving ""Built for Comfort,"" and picks two time-honored tunes out of his National steel-bodied. In short, his best in years, only what experimental genie drives him to flaw every one of his albums? Here it's ""Teacup's Jazzy Blues Tune,"" named after his jazz-loving brother-manager and featuring a virtually inaudible upright bass solo.

About time somebody whittled Taj's experiments down to a few classics, and nice to hear a blues album by him, even one from '66-'71. He sure is more idiomatic than any of the white guys who were doing revivals back then. Though he uses drums and electric guitars most of the time, he doesn't pattern himself on the hard, shouting Chicago style of Muddy Waters and such intense Delta forebears as Robert Johnson--his singing is assertive yet relaxed, like an unmenacing Lightnin' Hopkins with a healthy admixture of John Hurt. He does get too relaxed at times, even with ""Six Days on the Road"" to keep him alert. But this is where to begin.

Maybe I have a weakness for African-Americans from Hawaii, or maybe this one knows how to bend the blues, croon the diaspora and also sing Hawaiian. Then again, on his strongest non-collaborative album since the '70s, it's possible he's just extra excited. At 66, he leads multiple bands, including Los Lobos and Ivan Neville's crew through previously unmined naturals, from ""Scratch My Back"" to ""Diddy Wah Diddy,"" and keeper originals such as ""Strong Man Holler,"" in praise of a woman who was sweet 17 in halcyon 1959.

No longer does Mahal talk a bigger African diaspora than he walks. He deserves his top billing, but every other musician on this piece of serendipity is a West African retrofitting a simple little studio in Athens GA. Like the guitar hotshot he'd have turned into Stateside, costar Diabate is a virtuoso and nothing more, and his Manding songs are mostly some kind of change. But when his kora echoes the happy-hollering ""Ol' Georgie Buck"" or the deep-Delta ""Catfish Blues,"" those straightforward old blues take on a filigree Diabate's percussive confederates can go to work on. And when Mahal's piano strides beneath the balafon of a Diabate named Lasana, the rhythms canter so comically you wonder who said open sesame.

Powered by studio stalwarts who know their own strength, the music he's aimed for since his early-'80s comeback has been a runaway train, as unwithstandable as a prime metal anthem. And the late-'70s stuff on The Lion of Soweto often seems despondently formulaic. This early-'70s music is spare, exploratory, feeling its cornmeal--always less luxurious than the songs of his maturity, sometimes more fun. And let's hear it for Alfius Madlokovu, whose bass has strings.

The great groaner's 1983 reunion with his greatest backup groups--not just the Queens, returned to the life after a decade of domesticity, but Makgona Tsohle, featuring nonpareil guitarist Marks Mankwane and ubiquitous saxophonist-producer West Nkosi--culminates for the nonce in this 1986 showcase. Not counting ""I Wanna Dance,"" exactly the sort of ""disco"" that's supposed to be against his principles, it's unexceptionably indestructible, bottomless baritone flexed inexorably against stout sopranos, with Mankwane's licks and Nkosi's pennywhistle darting like traffic up top. Professional dance music at its finest and roughest.

It's disorienting at first to hear women singing what sounds like mbube, and though the weave would be richer (and more competitive) if most of them weren't this fifty-five-year-old matriarch, whose still-powerful voice has definitely thickened, the disorientation is salutary--South African pop is very male. Half the tunes are gorgeous and all of them are traditional, drawn from a cross-section of tribal cultures dominated by Makeba's clicking Xhosa. But they're not recreated, which usually means embalmed at best--they're interpreted for the studio, which permits Makeba her overdubs and enables Russ Titelman to lock in the spare accompaniment. There's even a synthesizer, and damned if I can tell exactly where.

Which on this Ryan Adams-produced solo debut turns out to be ""roots"" or ""Americana,"" and before you snort too loud consider David Johansen's progress toward Harry Smith. Those who seek movement in their music will find the arrangements boxy, and Malin may yet learn that real men aren't supposed to keen as if mourning their faithful hound. The voice asserts itself as the record sinks in, however, and not only does each song stand out, but the production variegates a sonic grandeur grounded in the rock verities--check Adams's stutter-step guitar on the title track, or the corrida echoes of ""Almost Grown."" What Malin mourns has urban roots--a maturing alt dweller's ills, details provided and remedies hopefully adduced.

The Artist Formerly Known as S.M. has blown his chance, because if ever an album cried out to be called Eponymous Solo Debut, Stephen Malkmus is that album. Exactly the unpredictable effort you'd expect, it utilizes a new bunch of Portland buddies to render the old noises into background music as it explores such themes as Yul Brynner's makeover and piracy on the coast of Montenegro. Either he kicks off from the latter to create gangsta alt, or he bites the bullet and turns into an incisive musical observer of manners and mores. Another possibility, I admit it: He shrivels into irrelevancy.

On the other hand, the classic ""Suzana"" and the gorgeous ""Fati Mata"" were worth the wait. As was the Fania All-Star approach to Kinshasa rumba, especially on the infinitely reprisable ""Afrika-Mokili-Mobimba,"" which somebody with more right than me must already have nominated for continental anthem.

On two renowned late-'70s albums, seven cuts totaling about an hour, the polyrhythms are far less elaborate than in present-day soukous, the tunes far more direct. The booklet attributes their winning confidence to the vibrant culture of early independence, and though artistic and commercial logic would have led to overdevelopment anyway, the metaphor is evocative. It's that the-world-is-in-front-of-me thing. Think early hip hop--or early Beatles.

One of numerous wannabees who departed a Kinshasa controlled by Mobutu and/or Franco and Rochereau to service rumba-starved Kenyans, Mapangala named his band after a Zairean volcano. And up against the rustic underdevelopment of Nairobi pop in the '70s, any soukous variant could pass itself off as an eruption. But in the world-beat disco of 1990, Virunga's snaky bass and nimble guitar come off as spaced and delicate as the falsetto leads Mapangala trades with Fataki, his only permanent sideman, and the twin saxophones are low-budget funky, their cheesy embouchure stuck between alto and soprano. So for outsiders the music's beauty is far more fragile, or spiritual, than artist or natural audience believe. Which doesn't mean we can't sway to it.

Cover claims to the contrary, not ""fiery stuff""--not by the hyped-up standards of the soukous this eternal exile has now outlasted. That's why it's special, and that's why it's good. Everywhere he's gone, from Matadi to Kinshasa to Kampala to Nairobi to Paris to his safe Maryland home, Mapangala has brought along a tenor as sweet as a licked frenum and a tune sense that knows what it wants--no wonder he found the sway of Swahili swing so amenable. Here he gathers about him a different set of Afro-Parisian hotshots than on his last visit, except for, no stupe he, the two standouts: guitarist Caien Madoka and trap drummer Komba Bellow Mafwalo. ""It is bad to criticize people behind their back, especially when they have tried to help you,"" one trot reads, but who cares? The music carries any message of tolerance you care to verbalize.

If you want to know what revolutionary music might sound like, put aside the translations and just listen. Sounds like regular music, doesn't it? In plain English, Mapfumo's expressive and rhythmic authority are all the meaning you need. And the translations from the Shona suggest other virtues. He has sufficient respect for his listeners' intelligence (and his own life, though he was jailed for a while anyway) to couch his messages in innuendo. And unlike so many African pop stars, he's not afraid to take on traditional wisdom when traditional wisdom is impeding history.

Though there's nothing here as compelling as the Bristol-stomping ""All my life"" wail of ""Hupenyu Wangu,"" this is looser and more indigenous than such renowned mid-'80s albums by the father of Zimbabwean pop as Chimurenaga for Justice. Never have his guitars sounded more like mbiras; never have his rhythms better evoked their own intricate selves. The vocals are also relaxed, giving off an aura of ruminative wisdom that may even have some truth to it. What can it be like to sing the poor against the rich in the language of your tribally divided country's ruling culture? Helps that, geopolitically, Shona is still a have-not tongue.

Having first invented a genre and then deployed it against colonialism, Mapfumo would rank with Franco or Youssou N'Dour if only his usages were pan-African instead of southern African or Zimbabwean or Shonan. While he's remarkably reliable--now past 50, he's less rote than Rochereau or Mahlathini, neither of whom phones his music in--his adaptation of thumb piano effects to guitar-band dynamics will remain marginal except among Afropop acolytes. So the more accessible of two recent compilations is a good place to pick up on him. Sharply danceable as often as not, it cherry-picks 12 especially catchy 1978-1993 tracks. You can tell the newer ones because his voice is deeper.

The 16 cuts on this remastering of a cassette compiled by Mapfumo circa 1993, all of which originally surfaced as Zimbabwean seven-inches, consume pretty much the same 70-plus-minutes as the 12 on the Hemisphere collection. Which means that, relatively speaking, they're more about song than groove, and that their groove has a little more reggae/herb skank and a little less benga/whatever propulsion--they're gentler, more ruminative. The earlier dates are also a plus in theory, although I can't claim to distinguish the fresh from the formulaic even so. In fact, I doubt the artist knows the difference himself.

The fast ones are colorful and juicy, too--squooshy with funk slides and compulsive puns, so unguarded in their emotionality you'd fear for her sanity if she weren't so tough.

At about 40 she's on her seventh solo outing since 2000. Not an exciting prospect, and while it's solidly tuneful and cleverly arranged, not exactly an exciting record either--which it turns out is thematic for this matter-of-fact bunch of terrific songs. Not bitter, certainly not despairing, defiant and funny in a muted way, it's an album about being in love with Nobody, as in ""Nobody('s Perfect),"" or ""Nobody knows the troubles I've seen/I trust Nobody and Nobody trusts me""--which has a companion piece called ""Not Talk,"" as in ""Let's not talk about it later."" I wouldn't trust her myself. But I note that the song about being a whore is really about marginalization in the music business. Well, one of the songs about being a whore.

But when flugelhorn maestro Boban Markovic and Serbian bassist Nicola Pejovic went so far as to remix the thing, they made it clearer and more ""commercial."" Clarity includes extra percussion and more breaks for trumpet prodigy Marko. Commerce requires cross-cultural gestures and lyrics, some in English (""When the music hit the beat, feel the magic, a-ha"").

That falling-down-drunk thing is in abeyance. But if you've ever read an ecstatic account of a great polka band who proved too cutesy by half on record, this is what you hoped they'd sound like.

Like Huun-Huur-Tu and Tinariwen, this is one of those how-much-is-enough bands. I've pretty much liked every record they've put out since I caught on with 2003's Boban i Marko, which was where flugelhorn prodigy and heir apparent Boban started getting equal billing in the brass ensemble he now leads. Did I learn to tell these albums apart? Not really. Replay them? Seldom. But after suitable reconnaissance I can make some distinctions for you. If you actively like Boban i Marko, this will be worth your while even though it scatters three keepers from that breakthrough among its own 15. But if you found Boban i Marko too raffish or disorganized, it may also be worth your while, because it comes down on tune where that one came down on the tipsy Balkan version of groove. I must have noticed ""Khelipe E Cheasa"" on Devla, but it never penetrated my recall memory, which is my bad. Relaxed, jaunty, and devilishly catchy, it leads their best-of because it's their best. The rest of the collection does what it can to keep on keeping on.

Never mind Bright Balkan Morning's Steven Feld soundscape, which overdoes ambience, or Knitting Factory's wannabe Slavic Soul Party in Makedonia, which shortchanges chops. This Serbian-Roma horn band is where I hear the Balkan-style ""participatory discrepancy"" Charles Keil declares unrecordable--the ""relaxed dynamism,"" the ""semiconscious or unconscious slightly out of syncness."" Father-and-son flugelhorn virtuoso-and-phenom trade perky theme statements and heartbreaking solos in an ensemble that hangs loose from the slack wire between chaos and expertise. Tuneful and jaunty when it's generic, miraculous and hilarious when it hits--or just misses--its groove.

The rushed tempos take their toll in aura: ""Trenchtown Rock"" can be far more precise, painful, and ecstatic; like most live albums this relies on obvious material. But the material is also choice, unlike most live albums it's graced by distinct sound and economical arrangements, and the tempos force both singer and the band into moments of wild, unexpected intensity. I used to think Natty Dread's ""No Woman, No Cry"" was definitive.

If this is MOR, it's MOR like good Steely Dan--MOR with a difference. Marley has sung with more apparent passion, it's true, but never more subtly, and his control of the shift in conception that began with Exodus is now absolute.

With Tosh and Bunny departed, he rose to power as a bandleader rather than a songster, writing well enough while he mastered groove and sound and interplay. Except for ""Jamming,"" a title that sums up the period perfectly, nothing since his solo-with-band debut Natty Dread has had the instant-classic immediacy of two very different offerings here: the dancy pop shot ""Could You Be Loved"" and the spirit anthem ""Redemption Song."" ""Real Situation"" (""It seems like total destruction/ The only solution"") and ""We and Dem"" (need dey say more?) are apocalyptic enough to scare the bejezus out of Babylonian well-wishers, ""Coming in From the Cold"" and ""Forever Loving Jah"" mellow enough to hold out hope.

With Joe Higgs standing in for Babylon-shy Bunny Livingston, the seven songs they recorded before an audience of half a dozen at the KSAN studios one morning in 1973--maddeningly interspersed with separately tracked bits of a 1975 interview that make a CD you can program a must--isn't just the best live Wailers I've ever heard, but the best Wailers I've ever heard. The ensemble--which by the time of 1976's Live! will substitute the dutifully beautiful I-Threes for his male mates and adjust the instrumentals to arena scale--is at a supple, subliminal peak of interactive intimacy and intensity. The previously unreleased ""Am-A-Do"" plus three later outtakes are a letdown only by comparison.

I prefer several that sample reggae oldies not by his dad--Bunny Wailer, the Skatalites, Eek-a-Mouse. What is by his dad is Damian's authority. The son's legacy--this son's, anyway--is an international music of black protest that subsumes hip-hop more easily than hip-hop subsumes reggae. He's to both manor and manner born--his convictions reflect his inheritance and his professional training, not his experience. But he's learned his lessons well.

This isn't just figureheads rising to the occasion or getting back to where they once belonged, although both models pertain--especially for Marsalis, who enjoys the blues enough that his monster chops masticate them lip-smackingly rather than chewing them up and spitting them out. What's decisive, however, is a conception in which the members of a blues horn section interact polyphonically rather than uniting in the soulful Texas manner while blues polymath Clapton dictates as well as plays and sings a repertoire that includes Memphis Minnie and Howlin Wolf as well as W.C. Handy and Johnny Dodd. The juxtaposition may discomfit at first--we're not used to blues so jaunty and effervescent. But let it and it'll lift you right up.

The trumpeter-bureaucrat didn't just tamp down his jazz chauvinism as such pop titans as Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson and roots flamekeepers as the Blind Boys of Alabama and Tedeschi-Trucks paid their respects at these 2003-2007 fund-raisers. He put his smarts, chops, and combo at the full service of artistes from Jimmy Buffett to Audra Macdonald. There's not much guitar and, you guessed it, no rapping whatsoever. But just about every song is enlarged. Dylan negotiates the horns that elaborate ""It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry"" like the born hipster he is. Lyle Lovett is a hipster too. Macdonald was made for ""Creole Love Call"" as she was for little else. Ray Charles is alive, which was all it ever took. James Taylor and John Mayer put their all into self-penned songs about what dicks they are. ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"" is transformed into nine-tenths of the freedom song Lenny Kravitz dreamt it could be. Derek Trucks's ""I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free"" solo very nearly obliterates that feat. And to top off his show of shows, Marsalis sings a song of his own--sans Auto-Tune, you bet.

I can distinguish Tucker from the other boogie bands because they favor cowboy hats, but danged if I can tell their albums apart. Country people know one cow from the next, too, but poor deracinated souls like me refuse to be bothered until A&amp;P runs out of milk and r&amp;r runs out of gimmicks. Toy Caldwell does write pretty good songs for a boogie man, though, about one a year to go with the album, and it's nice to have them all in one place. Pure boogie mythos, with lots of ""Ramblin'"" and ""Searchin' for a Rainbow,"" though I'm pleased to report that there are more miners and, yes, cowboys here than gamblers, a reassuring token of social responsibility. I recommend this album. It's as near as you can get these days to hearing that old steam whistle blow.

This hugely appealing, moderately disturbing piece of pop has no more credibility with the keepers of hip hop's gated community than Calvin Butts, Al Roker, or the great neglected legacy of the Fat Boys. Mase's phlegmatic, just-woke-up drawl earns the overused term ""flow"" more than any delivery since Snoop's--unflappably indolent, fonder of vowels than consonants, he has no trouble rhyming ""my limo"" and ""sex symbol"" and is at ease with both tropes. His congested timbre warm rather than cool, he sounds goofy and utterly confident at the same time, the cuddliest rapper ever. But for his audience, cuddly and raunchy are anything but mutually exclusive, and like most ass men only more so, Mase isn't always so cute. He has his ""four pimp rules,"" his ""please no hickeys 'cause wifey's with me,"" his detailed list of freak-me requirements that climaxes with the sudden ""If she make my nuts itch I kill that slut bitch."" Black Barney, if you're talking this shit just to impress your boys, forget it, because it won't. You know the score: ""Niggaz say they love me, they dont love me/I know deep down they wanna slug me/I feel the vibe when they hug me.""

Trip hop without pain or mess, thick-textured and clean-etched, doing a solid for vocalists in need (they return Tracey Thorn's favor with interest, including an introduction to unknown-but-equal Nicolette) and stretching instrumentals into a weird comfort zone (e.g. the almost literally atmospheric ""Weather Storm,"" which I assume was a little too unusual for the funk-lite hedonists in producer Nellee Hooper's own band). Definitive: ""Karmacoma,"" a title that would say everything you need know about the killing pleasures of killer weed if Tricky's stoned vocal didn't say so much more.

The most ballyhooed dub album of the current resurgence does reveal a few secrets to nonbelievers. Juicier, funnier, and more eventful than the desiccated run of Macro Dub Infection, it also sustains a convincing gravity--a sense that all these whooshings and clangings and suckings and scrapings and boomings and snatches of tune relate to each other and the rest of the physical universe. Not that they do, necessarily. But aren't you glad they care enough to fib about it?

Apocalypse my ellipsis, pipes of Pan my patootie. Forget the delusions of grandeur this Tunisian mountain music has given rock and rollers since Brian Jones expected to fly and settle for a few facts, because the facts are grand enough. We have here an incontrovertibly sacred music with no regard for what any theocrat would validate as decorum or beauty. Dominated by screechy horns, it's loud, fast, percussive, and, whatever its scalar conventions, dissonant. Not only is it exciting because it's ugly, it's supposed to be exciting because it's ugly. That's why Bill Laswell went and recorded it again. And a good thing too, because a quarter century after Jones died, we rock and rollers know its scales well enough to find it beautiful too. Excitingly ugly we already knew about it.

Masuka's an old-timer, a Zimbabwean with South African tribal ties who came up in the upwardly mobile artistic ferment of the Jo'burg '50s. Because there's not much country in her, her ""marabi"" derives from Sophiatown musical theatre rather than, say, Zulu wedding music. Sprucing up tried-and-true melodies with mbira-based chimurenga effects, she constructs a swingingly syncretic popular style that partakes of more than its allotted portion of pop--and that sounds southern African, not South African, with none of mbaqanga's guttural thrust or mbube's intricate spirituality. Nobody this side of Abdullah Ibrahim has made the musical aspirations of genteel black South Africans so credible.

Laswell, Beinhorn &amp; Co. have obviously been listening to the radio instead of complaining about the end of the world. The result is a protean disco album that sounds like real New York rock and roll. Chic guitar and planet-rocking vocoders are only the beginning--several of these experiments seem designed to cross over right behind ""Eye of the Tiger,"" and never have electronically processed rhythms throbbed with such life. All that's missing is a deeper feeling for singers and songs, an old problem that the finest and most atypical track suggests is remediable--Soft Machinist Hugh Hopper's ""Memories,"" which guest stars Whitney Houston and Archie Shepp, transfers into one of the most gorgeous ballads you've ever heard.

FALSE,A-,Re-Arrange Us,Mates of State,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15511,"
Alternia knows two things about this duo: raw biography and raw sound. Married, two kids, publicly affectionate on stage; so tuneful they embarrass coolsters who think babies are icky, but also, due to how hard Kory Gardner pumps her organ and John Hammel meets his match, energetic, rendering the tunes forgivable. And right, sometimes their hooks are sugary enough to give me a tummyache too. But for Gardner to devote herself to piano as Hammel quiets down doesn't justify the consensus diagnosis of, eeuw, domesticity. Musical symptoms just aren't specific enough. Instead one must refer to those supposedly unmusical carriers of specificity, the words. Seldom anything special in the past, now they add up to a painful, unresolved song sequence about a couple who buy a biographically verifiable dream house and then hit the rocks as definitely the husband and possibly the neglected wife seek sexual solace elsewhere. So no, Pitchfork guy, you can't call ""Blue and Gold Print"" a lullaby just because it's slow and invokes the kiddies. No, Pop Matters guy, you can't praise the ""The Re-Arranger""'s arrangement without noting that one thing getting rearranged is lives. Pop hooks deployed to keep up a good front are too complicated for tummyaches. Not heartaches, though.

Kory Gardner and Jason Hammel are strong singers with a weakness for melody who play keyboards and drums, such indie lifers that they went and had two kids on the theory they could just tour with them--check Gardner's Band on the Diaper Run blog. Never scrawny like punk (they rolled new wave) or twee like synth-pop (organ is Gardner's meat), they developed surprising muscle tone for a duo without breaking on through. But their seventh album opens with a simulated big-pop anthem and maintains that size and momentum without compromising their ability to play the new songs live. The discord that surfaces in the last few lyrics may indicate bumps in their marital road. But it definitely indicates how hard it is to write 10 near-corny pop songs without a hint of unhappy love. And the wholeness of the music leaves us feeling they're more than OK.

""Wonderful! Wonderful!"" ""It's Not for Me To Say,"" ""Chances Are,"" ""The Twelfth of Never,"" ""Wild Is the Wind""--no matter what vision of principled glitz Mark Eitzel glimpsed at the master's feet, those five songs are the substance of Mathis's legend and legacy. Poised on the cusp of black and white, masculine and feminine, they projected an image of egoless tenderness, an irresistible breath of sensuality that infused the airwaves for the second half of 1957 and kept 1958's Johnny's Greatest Hits on the album chart for 490 weeks. By 1960, however, he'd been pimped by Vegas vainglory, flexing his vocal muscle though millions of women yearned only for 	his touch, and at his all-too-normal worst (""Love Theme From Romeo and Juliet,"" arghh) he's pure beefcake. Yet though you can still buy Greatest Hits (and cheap, too), most of its filler is utterly characterless. This regular-price 18-cut does turn to schlock, but also offers up the young Johnny doing right by standards like ""Misty,"" ""Maria,"" and ""Stranger in Paradise."" Give him his due--and then use your programming buttons.

I'm no respecter of soundtracks, but I can count--this offers seven new songs (as many as his previous LP) plus two self-sustaining instrumentals. It's not epochal, but it comes close--maybe Mayfield writes tougher when the subject is imposed from outside than when he's free to work out of his own spacious head. Like the standard-setting ""Freddie's Dead,"" these songs speak for (and to) the ghetto's victims rather than its achievers (cf. ""The Other Side of Town,"" on Curtis), transmitting bleak lyrics through uncompromisingly vivacious music. Message: both candor and rhythm are essential to our survival.

Lionized by r&amp;b aficionados who'd rather groove a lounge than rock a joint, Mayfield has the substance operators like Charles Brown and Jesse Belvin made a show of. Compiler Billy Vera might have varied the flow with oddments from the follow-up, Memory Pain. But except for Willie Dixon, widely suspected of exploiting help he didn't talk about, no one on the jumping postwar black pop scene wrote with more brains or care, and he sang with a nicely oiled confidence that never ground against his suave, full arrangements. Not a god for most of us, but a resource--a sufferer who had more to say about suicide than is dreamt of in Metallica's philosophy.

The most original and syncretic new band yet to reach us from 21st-century Africa--unless I just mean album, as French-Irish drummer-bassist-producer Liam Farrell layers on a kitchen sink of distortions every bit as organic as the Congotronics that add novelty/authenticity to the focus track ""Malukayi."" There's none of soukous's hard-won elegance here--the flowing grooves, the masterful voices, the horns. Instead the choppy rhythms recall Staff Benda Bilili, whose Theo Nzonza and Coco Ngambala provide tenor and baritone, with Ngamabla the odds-on creator of two killer change-of-pace ballads whatever the conspicuously absent copyright notices say. This is African music as an object of Euro-American commerce with no false aura of postcolonial purity. I hope I get the chance to see it take human form.

FALSE,A-,Run Devil Run,Paul McCartney,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2688,"
I don't want to call McCartney the most complacent rock and roller in history. The competition's way too stiff, especially up around his age, and anyway, I'm not judging his inner life, only his musical surface. From womp-bom-a-loo-mom to monkberry moon delight, his rockin' soul and pop lyricism always evinced facility, not feeling, and his love songs were, as he so eloquently put it, silly. This piece of starting-over escapism isn't like that at all, as, robbed of the wife he loved with all his heart, McCartney returns to the great joy of his adolescence in a literally death-defying formal inversion. So light it's almost airborne, Gene Vincent's ""Blue Jean Baby"" opens; so wild it's almost feral, Elvis Presley's ""Party"" closes. Some familiar titles are merely redone or recast, which beyond some Chuck Berry zydeco gets him nowhere. But arcana like Fats Domino's ""Coquette"" and Carl Perkins's ""Movie Magg"" could have been born yesterday, three originals dole out tastes of strange, and on two successive slow sad ones, the Vipers' hung-up obscurity ""No Other Baby' and Ricky Nelson's lachrymose hit ""Lonesome Town,"" the impossibility of the project becomes the point. Teenagers know in some recess of their self-involvement that their angst will have a next chapter, but McCartney's loneliness is permanent. Not incurable--the music is a kind of new life. But its fun is a spiritual achievement the man's never before approached.

Without self-dramatization--she favors plain melodies and commonplace imagery and her singing is gamely unhistrionic--this woman explores Joni Mitchell's territory with equal intelligence, more charm, and no drums. Her album is a rough song cycle in which she responds to the footloose incorrigibility of the musicians she loves by getting in a car with a guitar herself--without romanticizing the process.

On record as much as live, two folkies whose solo work runs from pleasant (Ringer) to special-if-flawed (McCaslin) make up a whole equal to the sum of its parts, which is quite enough--her precise, slightly astringent soprano is the other half of his offhand baritone. In addition to the only version of ""Geronimo's Cadillac"" you need to own, this revives traditional mountain songs so matter-of-fact and out-of-this world that you can understand why folklorists devote their lives to the stuff. And on the finale, ""Hit the Road Jack,"" the dry, intelligent humor they share--hers mock-prim, his nice-gruff--finally reaches the surface.

Musically, Woody Guthrie can wear out his welcome right quick, but it would be perverse to deny the inherent musicality of his lyrics. By my count, this is the seventh consecutive album in which friendly meddlers such as Wilco, Billy Bragg, the Klezmatics, and Rob Wasserman turn a few of his unnotated songpoems into something worth hearing again and again. Bluegrass lefty McCoury is an easy fit as he applies his lively trad to the New York subway system, budget car repair, a good-paying federal road project, a kind woman, a cute baby, and being poor. Only when Guthrie's sexism surfaces does the mood curdle. Born in 1939, McCoury is old enough to know that jokes about wimmin's hats were old hat by 1950 and probably weren't funny to begin with.

This Vancouver rapper and label owner takes keeping it real and writing what you know further than any other label owner would let him. In my favorite song he tracks payables and receivables and remarks existentially, ""In the end we're all living off consignment."" But that's not the only one where he describes how dull his life is and then makes that seem interesting. Playing and mixing keyb or guitar over cut-up drums, he thinks out loud in an utterly un-street cadence that reaches across the northland from Buck 65 to Slug out to B.C. In the end you not only feel you know this hard-working guy, you want to find out where he's going and wish him godspeed. Subsistence hip hop--can it survive? Not forever. Order some now.

How great you think she is depends on how great you think her voice is. I say that for all her reach and technique she's too contained and too generic; direct comparison with Wells or Cline or Lynn or Wynette or Parton leaves her in the dust. Which means that like other mortal country artists she's made for the best-of, where every song counts. This one marches them past chronologically, two by two from each of her first five MCA albums (omitting the current Last One to Know). Significantly, the only dud is the only violin showcase, from her label debut--pseudopurism does suit her. Also significantly, the greats are from albums two, three, and four, not five (or six). And the centerpiece is ""Whoever's in New England,"" where pseudopurism lets on how far its thoughts sometimes stray from home.

Indie-rap concept album about, what else, the perils of indie-rap--only it's also about loving a dog who'll let you do anything, loving a woman who won't, the vagaries of conscience, imagining violence, and the perils of any musical profession. Guru picks him up in a cab, Gary Numan turns him down for a job at Guitar Center, and his hero Premier won't even finish the drop Esoteric buys because he can't afford a whole beat. But though his beats aren't Premo quality, they're more than enough to keep an album moving when the plot slows down.

A severe disappointment at first--a rather obvious and awkward attempt, I thought, to tailor a record to some dimly conceived high school ""underground,"" with titles like ""Teenage Lust"" and lines like ""Young people everywhere are gonna cook their goose/Lots of kids are working to get rid of these blues"" (political italics mine). But the music had its way with me. Under Jon Landau, the 5's style has become choppier, harder, and more concise; when his discipline is imposed on the soaring Sinclair-meets-Coltrane expansionism of their Elektra album, as on ""Looking at You,"" the tension is pyrotechnic. The only failure is the ballad, ""Let Me Try."" But all that will make this album an undeniable success is for it to sell--with propaganda, that's the test. Which means it will probably remain an ambiguous experiment.

The rest of the obscure stuff merely augments a superbly paced compilation. The raw songcraft and new-thing chaos of Detroit's other great protopunk band were further ahead of their time than it seemed five years ago. And drummer Dennis Thompson was a motherfucker.

Having reclaimed their equilibrium and resigned themselves to making their own music in their own place, the sisters come up with the rockingest album of their reluctant career, with Andrew Cowan's guitar a pervasive presence and Mark Knopfler himself sitting on one track. The effect is gratifyingly smart, tasty, and unforced, with every song perfectly articulated. But the equilibrium extends all too comfortably to the material itself--there's none of the wrenching luminosity of a ""Mendocino"" or a ""Walking Song"" or a ""Bundle of Sorrow, Bundle of Joy.""

Let Rufus and Martha confess and emote, and sure, jolly Uncle Chaim into going public with that lonely tune of his--it's so modest it'll fit right in. Because what the grown-ups in charge are after is songs per se, songs of every provenance and orientation. Berlin and Porter and Foster at their most quiet and obscure, folk songs from hither and yon, that hootenanny refrain they were once so sick of, good old ""Young Love."" Loudon has no choice but to sing his heart out for once, and Linda is so peripheral she wonders why she dropped in. By the time Martha hits that impossible high note on a slow-dance finale originally cribbed from Schubert and Liszt for Earl Carroll's Vanities of 1931, we know she's not putting Mom and Dad on notice. She's just loving the song, loving the song.

FALSE,A-,Odditties,Kate & Anna McGarrigle,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15393,"
A hodgepodge segmented to make sense as a sampler, all recorded by 1990 and most well before, consisting of: 1) Four Stephen Foster weepers, two Civil War and two early death, harmonized prettily instead of tartly. They're saccharine, yes, but wittingly so, and exposure plus comparison with a Foster comp I like convinced me that this was the most effective rendering of 19th-century parlor music I knew. 2) Two by Canadian folk icon Wade Hemsworth, a McGarrigles staple in their Mountain City Four days--the first a waltz that motorvates plenty after those weepers, the second in 5/4 and over my fundament. 3) A Quebecois encore done live in '76 and a Cajun two-step studio-stomped. Both leap the language barrier. 4) Four lost McGarrigles songs, three by Anna and a collaborator, one by Kate alone. All are worthy, two wondrous: Anna's threnody for her cat Louis, which is slight, and Kate's love song to Martha and her dolls, which is wiry. Play it for someone you love on Mother's Day. But be sure to check it out yourself first.

FALSE,A-,Greatest Hits,Jimmy McGriff,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1709,"
In a world where Roy Ayers is counted a beatwise godfather by acid jazz casualties, the continued obscurity of this B-3 master isn't excused by his signature quote: ""What I play isn't really jazz. It's sort of in between."" Sounds disastrous, I know, but what he didn't say because he didn't know it is that he played funk, and not in the hard-bop sense. Early on he's still rooted in cocktail swing, although he has the populism to be vulgar about it, and as this collection cherry-picks its way through 10 '60s albums, both his attack and his uncredited rhythm sections grow tougher and trickier. By the end, well, ""The Worm"" and ""Fat Cakes"" may not be ""Cissy Strut"" or ""Look-Ka Py Py,"" but that's the territory. And later McGriff was known to join forces with Hank Crawford, whose continued obscurity will be taken up in a future lesson.

FALSE,A-,A Brief History of Rhyme: MC Hawking's Greatest Hits,MC Hawking,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12929,"
Absurdist comedy in which the virtually immobilized ""young, gifted and tenured"" theoretical physicist raps via a text-to-speech conversion program--about bitch-slapping his T.A. and drive-bying six ""punk ass bitches from MIT,"" about a bizang bigger than ""the sound of my gatt,"" about entropy and the end of all things, about the idiocy of creationists and others: ""New age motherfuckers/Don't get me started,/I made more sense than them,/Last time I farted."" It's not all equally mind-boggling, but the concept, which the real Hawking finds funnier than shizzit, is glorious. As creator Ken Leavitt-Lawrence must know, it's an affirmation not only of the primacy of reason but of its nihilistic gangsta power.

I'm not proud. I know damn well that one reason this quartet recording (issued in Europe in 1975 but unavailable here until recently) is my favorite new jazz release of the year is that it features 10 distinct tunes, only one of them a ballad. That's at least three bonus melodies, almost all in jumpy African bred meters. McIntyre plays reeds in the eclectic, jagged-to-lyrical modern manner, and his support--Jaki Byard on piano, Reggie Workman on bass, Andrei Strobert on drums--is as good as it gets.

Hidden smack in the middle of each of these two nine-track CDs are two forgettable songs, leaving 16 of 18 that are memorable melodically, lyrically, or both, which would be an accomplishment for Randy Newman himself. Not counting Stephin Merritt, no other under-40 approaches McKay's gift for cabaret. The worst you can say is that her satire is shallow--dissing yuppies in the '00s is the precise terminological equivalent of dissing hippies in the '80s. But ""Work Song"" (bosses), ""Inner Peace"" (New Ageism), ""It's a Pose"" (""God you went to Oxford/Head still in your boxers"") feel something like classic, and personal notes like the fond ""Manhattan Avenue"" and the fonder ""Dog Song"" suggest that soon her egomania will yield emotional complexities worthy of her talent.

In an antirockist moment when faerie folkies airier than Joanna Newsom and disco dollies emptier than Rihanna are thought to promise a braver, freer future, why isn't this manifestly hypertalented young person a generational hero? Couldn't have any connection, could it, to the fact that no fewer than three netcrits--all, as it happens, men--don't understand that the opening laugh line, ""Feminists don't have a sense of humor,"" is the well-turned piece of satire that makes everyone I play it for giggle? I agree--she's scattered, unfinished, self-indulgent. But she's also ebullient, funny and political. Her future looks brave and free to me.

Once the cabaret upstart was a golden faucet of song, but since she messed up her karma in 2007 by cracking a feminism joke that men didn't find cute, not to mention understand, the originals have dried up. So as cabaret stalwarts will, she's turned to Other People's Material. Having reimagined Doris Day in 2009, she ups the ante and reimagines the '60s in 2015. And from the sublime ""Sunny Afternoon"" and ""If I Fell"" to the ridiculous ""Red Rubber Ball"" and ""Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter,"" from the secret class politics of Alan Price and Moby Grape to the out-there freak politics of Frank Zappa and Jefferson Airplane, she manifests more historical grasp than any psych band yet to show its hand. Songs are so much easier to hold onto than acid visions you can only dream about.

Sobriety can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, especially in a Nashvillian who claims in so many words she expects ecstasy. If she joked around or liked to party, it might give her country goodness the wiggle room every way of life needs. But she does like to rock, and there's no denying her eye for out-of-the-way details or her ear for a decent tune. Of several believable love songs, I'll take the full-bodied ""Witness to Your Life"" over the spartan title tune. Of several believable unlove songs, I recommend ""Drinkin' Problem"" to Al-Anon.

McKenna's corniest album, and her strongest. Those who don't take conjugal love seriously may find it saccharine or some cornball shit like that. But there's plenty of salt in it, and the strictly literal words stay on topic--in ""The Luxury of Knowing,"" which he has and she doesn't; ""You Get a Love Song,"" in which a premature nuptial yields artistic dividends; ""Lorraine,"" her mother's name and also her own; ""Sweet Disposition,"" which her mother had and she's working on; ""That's How You Know,"" a post-breakup song so painfully rendered it could be a post-death song as well. My favorite is the finale, which is about heaven--literally. St. Peter and Jesus get cameos. Jesus turns out to be taller than you figured.

McKenna fell off my radar after Warners's excellent, Tim McGraw-produced Unglamorous in 2007, and I promise it won't happen again. She's a 47-year-old mother of five from Stoughton Mass who's currently paying the bills with Little Big Town's 2015 CMA honoree ""Girl Crush"" and McGraw's 2016 country smash ""Humble &amp; Kind""--parental advice that sounds humbler and kinder (and wiser) (even catchier) the way McKenna understates it on her tenth album and second with serious distribution, where it's one of seven straight winners that precede three not-bad-at-alls. Even the winners could use more beat or beef--sonically I prefer the rockish Unglamorous to Dave Cobb's Chris Stapleton-certified good taste here. But production is secondary with this gal. She's a winning singer, forthright and accomplished and idiomatic, implying a slight drawl instead of faking a big one. And her writing is major verging on great. Although she's been married to the same man since she was 19, the unions she evokes so concretely and succinctly are too different to all be her own. Anyway, my very favorite chorus is advice for a single girl: ""Deep down you know that you're worth more than this/Or the cost of that dinner last night/He'd be driving you home if he was worth half a shit/And his daddy had raised him up right."" Whew. Only then: ""But let me remind you there's real love out there down the road.""

FALSE,A-,New Wine in Old Bottles,Jackie McLean,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11394,"
The first side of Monuments, the funk record RCA has put out with McLean, is more than passable--although the tunes are ordinary and the groove is a little dead, McLean puts out and the groove isn't that dead. But Monument has jazzbos up in arms, and this record is why--the best McLean album in over a decade and it's not on a ""major"" label. The saxophonist's work here surpasses that on his European SteepleChase outings because the rhythm section of Hank Jones, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams encourages him to think as fast as he can play, which is plenty fast. He thinks just fine when he slows down, too, although Joe Raposo's ""Bein' Green"" is unworthy of him. Yet another reason Charlie Parker played bebop.

FALSE,A-,Horsebreaker Star,Grant McLennan,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1446,"
The pop Go-Between cut his most consistently catchy solo album by getting off the plane in Georgia and recording 30 snapshots of a resigned romantic, every damn one he had, with a producer and musicians he'd never met. The U.S. version borrows one track off the import-only Fireboy while dropping six from the worldwide double-CD, unrolling tune after sweet, simple-seeming tune for 77 minutes. My favorite lines involve, of all things, songs: ""Really loved the one about those L.A. freaks/Did it take a day to write or was it weeks?""; runner-up is one of 24 examples of ""Lovers living on what went wrong"": ""You can't find a kidney in Hong Kong."" With too many backing vocals, not enough licks, and a rather mild lead singer, the pleasures emerge gradually, mmm by mmm and aha by aha. But play these songs five years from now and every one will be yours.

The Go-Between with the weakness for wilderness was Robert Forster, a thoughtful guy given to rambling through the melodic underbrush. McLennan was the hooky one, and though at first I found his solo music irritatingly prefab, his techno tendencies have grown on me like a good Go-Betweens tune--the synthy guitar and hot drum programming put welcome glitz and steel into his romantic verse. In ""Haven't I Been a Fool?"" he's scrambling to cement the relationship he undermined. In ""Just Get That Straight"" he's trying to make the break final. In between he gets out of himself a lot.

An around-the-way girl who's always dissed the gangsta life from a street perspective, her greatest charm is the ordinariness that's also her biggest liability. In 1991, with Latifah and Monie Love passing her by, she failed to go pop with Act Like You Know; in 1993, with Latifah and Monie Love falling off, she's acting like she knew: ""Never ever have I ever said I was good-lookin'/Just one bad-ass bitch from Brooklyn."" But finally she's hitting her self-conceived rhymes and beats with some regularity--on the turf-proud ""Brooklyn,"" the jilted-and-glad ""Lil Paul,"" the bloodied-and-unbowed ""I Go On,"" the jovial ""F--k That M-----f--kin' Bulls--t."" And on the boy-loving ""Ruffneck,"" over a male chorus cheering like the studio was a football terrace, Lyte raps the praises of her hardcore boyfriend. ""Fiddling with his dickhead"" or sneaking away from the cops, he's always rude and not always what he pretends to be, but when she's got a problem: ""He'll be there/Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics."" I hope so. Because they're going to need each other.

FALSE,A-,Live in Aught-Three,James McMurtry,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16081,"
Last time I saw him he was switching off on six guitars, none of which he played with much verve--it was more like they were place holders, delaying tactics, a way through a 90-minute set, proof he wasn't just a writer. But though he does plod here, he also showcases his best early tunes, as a plodder had better. These are more likely attached to sardonically Dylanesque tales of personal inadequacy than to the sociopolitical extended metaphors and local-color narratives that came to the fore as of ""We Can't Make It Here."" But spurred by a Chuck Berry riff, it's the nine-minute meth-industry saga ""Choctaw Bingo"" that puts the set in gear, with ""60 Acres,"" ""Out Here in the Middle,"" and ""Levelland"" riding the same highway. That last one is dedicated to Max Crawford, identified as a member of the American Workers Party: ""Max was a communist, so he didn't fit in too good in Floydada."" James is a guy who prides himself on getting around.

Although Larry's boy has been arranging strong words into stolid strophes since 1989, it took four years of King George II to get a political song out of him. ""We Can't Make It Here,"" now Bernie Sanders's 2006 campaign theme, is still a hell of a downloadable loss leader at jamesmcmurtry.com, where the slogan is: ""We tour so we can make albums. We make albums so we can tour."" No other track quite matches its simmering rage, but a few come close, including two that mix carnage on America's holiday highways and carnage in America's holy wars. In the past, McMurtry's square-set solemnity has buried him in the Americana section. This time it makes him sound like a prophet.

The two fierce anti-Bush songs are rhetorical in a way the career-changing ""We Can't Make It Here"" wasn't: ""Cheney's Toy,"" for the universal soldier, and ""Ruins of the Realm,"" which ends up dancing in the ruins of the German Reich itself. Narrative he reserves for the yarns and portraits he's been hawking for two decades. The most detailed chronicles the love that slips away between a young musician and an older horsewoman. But the meth addict who loses her kids, the unsolved speedboat accident, the one-night stand that leaves the singer ""lookin' through the hole in the bottom of my heart""? All of them bite and hold, in part because the music is fierce. Live, McMurtry can still be way too strophic and trad. But he's never made an album so loud or hard. Righteous rage can do that to a person. Like I said, career-changing.

For those of us who admire the eminently capable McRae primarily for what she isn't--that is, a self-aggrandizing improvisor like Betty Carter or a nightclub hack like Nancy Wilson--this expanded reissue of the 13-track 1988 original is welcome because it honors Monk the melodist. Believe me, Johnny Mercer is not on board here; more than half the lyrics are by Jon Hendricks, who thinks ""body loose"" is a dandy rhyme for ""loose goose,"" although his biographical takes on ""Monk's Dream"" and ""In Walked Bud"" speak enjoyably to what he knows best, which is music. The same goes for McRae, who burnishes and reshapes these great tunes subtly enough to let you know how deeply she's thought about them. Although pianist Eric Gunnison gets through way too many notes, the Al Foster-George Mraz rhythm section adds more than most of those the master gigged with, and longtime Monk saxophonist Charlie Rouse is so intimate with the material that there are times when he tops the headliner even though he never tries to upstage her. Note if you like that when I loaded this onto my iPod, where it certainly belongs, I omitted the five perfectly acceptable alternate takes, which have the effect of making the music go on too long. For an hour, it's a gift to the dead.

Alone with various strange gods (is there another kind?) in the wide open spaces of his psyche, Arizonan Curt Kirkwood has stumbled upon a calmly demented country music that does more to revitalize the dubious concept of ""psychedelic"" than California suburbia's whole silly infatuation with the late '60s.

And while the lyrics do tend to glimmer away like heat rising off asphalt, they start from an everyday place anyone can see. Sometimes it's funny: ""Whoa, crazy, got myself a job."" Sometimes it's pissed: ""You said you'd make it grow/ You said you'd make it green."" Sometimes it's cheerful: ""I got a shirt that cost a dollar twenty-five/ I know I'm the best-dressed man alive.""

What'll keep them from turning into plutonium is the utterly unmacho vocals, brother harmonies making even ""Party Till the World Obeys"" and the one that begins ""Tie me up/Get it right"" seem like critiques of power, which is what they are--psychedelic in the nicest way yet again.

One secret of their bluegrass stylings is that they're not virtuosos. Another is that they cover not only Ronee Blakley and Nick Lowe but Abba and Ratt and that their own songs measure up. Frontwoman Jo Walston sounds fragile, dissolute, determined, and mean in unpredictable combinations. She's never more winning than when warning a ""little sister"" who may or may not be her kin against guys who leave bruises on your arm, and come to think of it men in general are piss-poor, and didn't you like it better living with me anyway?

Four stories that don't quite make sense about waking up with your friend's wife, going to hospital, failing, drinking. Actually the drinking one, a Merle Haggard song, makes sense on its own terms, but in the Mekons' world nothing makes sense, which in the least pessimistic construction is because all these songs are about drinking one way or another. In fact, all seem written from a permanent hangover. But it's fair to say that they've been driven to drink--by life, which is hard and then you die.

Interspersed with tour-bus patter, soused ad-libs, and other memorabilia, its selected honky-tonk retatters the reputation of a band that's made something friendly of the slop aesthetic without being jerks or airheads about it.

A dance record, maybe they think--except for the ""country"" song, every track motorvates off an atypically insistent and/or electronic riff or obbligato.

Periodizing their history for fun and mainly profit on their 2002 tour, the Mekons who could remember back that far--namely, trouper Jonboy Langford and sufferer Tom Greenhalgh--relearned the punk rants that set the stage for their transition to faux country. These aren't indelible tunes like ""At Home He's a Tourist"" or ""Suspect Device."" But months later they're still getting not just stronger but rawer, which isn't how this game usually works. One comparison is the eponymous hardcore album Rancid dropped in 2000 when ska felt played out, but this is sharper and more varied. Who could not love how ""32 Weeks,"" in which Rico Bell I think it is bellows out how much time it takes to earn the price of a car, a mattress, a bottle of whiskey, leads to ""Work All Week,"" in which Jonboy promises his beloved gold itself?

Having given up on changing the world and without much hope of comprehending it before it kills them, they convene here to record 11 obscure, fraught, forlorn songs written, near as one can tell, from the POV of middle-to-ruling class Britons negotiating the political turmoil before World War I.

So of course it was Langford who invited the Mekons' original vocalists--red-tape-cutting touring advisor Andy Corrigan and artist turned international antipoverty volunteer Mark White--to reconvene the 1977 edition of a band where current vocalists Tom Greenhalgh and Jon Langford played guitar and drums. Based on dim recollections of their Virgin debut, I wasn't surprised to learn the singers still can't sing, their breathy keen and outraged croak oddly indistinguishable sometimes. Yet as a Mekons fan I stuck at it, and to my surprise, these raggedy-ass plaints now add up to my favorite Mekons album since 2002's OOOH!. Corrigan and White are old enough to wonder when humanity got bored with peace and recognize that what we do now is the future. They extol border crossers, lose a daughter to war, and note that ""the average British household has 50,000 things.""  They're ""Still Waiting"" for ""an end to world hunger"" and ""the money to trickle down.""

His protagonists don't expect all that much and get less, but they're not beautiful losers--they're too ordinary, too miserable.

And Kenny Gamble could no more get off his high horse than he could do the dishes, so he includes the inevitable piece of male-chauvinism-as-moral-posture, ""Be for Real,"" instead of ""Satisfaction Guaranteed,"" which was a hit. And for all that this compilation is the best Teddy Pendergrass record you can buy.

In my tireless search for adults who know the difference between getting silly and acting the fool, I bring you a Dominican hit-maker who's so little-known in Anglophonia that the only Web info I could actually make sense of was some well-meaning afropop.org stuff about voudou and Afro-Dominican repression. Which is probably true as far as it goes, but misses the bucolic jocularity that jumps off every polka-like old-school merengue.

The Spotify hit on this seven-track placeholder for Mensa's Roc Nation debut is, what a surprise, its sole sex track: I'll tie you up, you bring Kiki along, etc. But give him credit for ignoring the crack trade--his drug songs are cautionary tales about Adderall addiction and dropping acid in the studio. Credit too for the shape and spark he found rejoining producer and homeboy Papi Beatz. And all respect to ""16 Shots,"" a Black Lives Matter anthem from a Chicagoan still outraged at the murder of Laquan McDonald so many police murders ago. The biracial son of a Ghanaian economics professor, Mensa isn't as smart as he thinks he is--""Everybody tryna be American idols/My X factor is I'm the only one with the voice"" is supposed to be clever? But he's made something of his advantages, confessing and accusing in street language that doesn't downplay his literacy, articulating so conversationally you'd think he was just talking to ya. And he's definitely smart enough to know that the most riveting words here are spoken without rhyme or rhythm by McDonald's lawyer, Jeffrey Nuslund--69 seconds impassively, objectively describing every brutal detail of a videotaped attack that took so much less time than that.

This isn't the music that revolutionized Ghanaian highlife circa 1948--it's the music that rationalized it a decade or so later. On the sweeter, simpler, early-'50s All for You, you can hear how Mensah must have jolted local swing worshipers when he pared down the horn sections and added beaters and shakers from Cuba and Trinidad. But like so many musicianly concepts, his synthesis flowers as his players gain assurance and chops, and for that matter so do his songs, rendered in six different languages and (at least) five different rhythms. Though the segue from the Twi ""Traditional"" ""Kaa No Wa"" to the Spanish ""Congo"" ""Senorita"" is genuinely surprising, it also makes perfect sense. It sounds like an artist at ease in a world of music that exfoliates out from the place he calls home.

It comprises three electro-raps and three electro-pops fronted by the so-called Coco Dame, whose lyrics are a lot less Latinate than her Missy Elliott paper.

Nine seven-inches etc. plus five previously unreleaseds including three remnants of an abandoned musical obviously add up to an intentional hodgepodge. Still, I wonder whether the intention was to backload. I got dubious tracks four through eight, beginning with a faux Patsy Cline song that some find vrai and sounds like merde to me, only to be swept off my feet by Merritt thoughtfully intoning some little green men's ""Song From Venus."" Then there's the paranoid-robotic ""When I'm Not Looking, You're Not There.""

Unless you happen to be dancing, it takes a slightly inappropriate aesthetic concentration to, er, appreciate a whole album of party instrumentals. But this compilation of thirteen turn-of-the-decade r&amp;b hits (plus album tracks) the Meters cut for Josie is worth the strain. The secret: listen to Ziggy Modeliste. He plays more off-beats and eccentric patterns than any soul drummer you ever heard, yet never breaks up the band's spare, clever riff structures; it's almost as if he's the lead. These cuts are short and catchy. Not one of them is as amazing as Rejuvenation's ""It Ain't No Use."" But every one works.

If the 26 cuts on disc one are more than you need at a sitting, program. On Reprise they went pop, presaging both the Neville Brothers (sans Aaron) and the mediocre fusion a band of the same name tours behind to this day. Disc two does this period as proud as possible right down to the shameless grease of ""Funkify Your Life,"" if not the shameless schmaltz of ""Be My Lady.""

Concept: giant cartoon monsters overrun either the world or the small Tampa-metro city of New Port Richey, where Pennsylvania-born Caffrey came of age. Subconcepts: the evolution of both cartooning and disaster flicks in millennial youth culture plus the evolution of music ""from pop punk to '90s alternative, sludge metal, ambient, and back."" The omnipresent guitars betray no showoff macho, I've been brain-humming ""'Hey, New Port Richey'"" for days, and while the concept is goofy and generational and a tad hyperaesthetic, it also acknowledges an apocalypse that may literally impend. The key idea is attributed to a buddy of Caffrey who has since died: ""Once you get to be a certain size, it doesn't matter if you're good or bad / You're so big, you cause destruction wherever you go / Whether you want to or not / You can't help it.""

With a less complex and compelling artist I might make the opposite choice, though even the hippest mash-ups and mix tapes have less to say than they're given credit for. But I find more fascination--and pleasure, if not variety--in M.I.A. juxtaposed against herself than in, for instance, favela funk juxtaposed against ""Walk Like an Egyptian.""

Deer Tick's John McCauley is the centerpiece of this Americana supertrio. Compared to Matt Vasquez of the florid Delta Spirit or Taylor Goldsmith of the wan Dawes, he's got the melodies, the wit, and the cultivated rasp. What he doesn't have is the ripeness of spirit without which roots music dies on the vine. So the doting Vasquez love song ""Blue Eyes,"" the lyrical Dawes lost song ""Thanks for Nothing,"" and the clippety-clopping Replacements road song ""Portland"" all augment the deep craft and acrid wordplay of the guy who's why you heard them--in fact, who's why you heard this varied, consistent, tune-conscious album. Catchiest of all is the McCauley road song ""Mom and Dad,"" sing-song rather than clippety-clop and better for it: ""Mama gave a camera to her little star/All she gets is pictures of hotels and bars/No Big Ben, no Statue of Liberty.""

Midler thinks ""cabaret"" encompasses every emotion and aspiration ever transfixed by pop music. People who've seen her like this record more than people who haven't, which isn't good. But as someone who's been entranced by her show many times I'm grateful for a production that suggests its nutty quality without distracting from her voice, a rich instrument of surprising precision, simultaneously delicate and vulgar. I'd ease up on the '60s nostalgia by replacing ""Chapel of Love"" with ""Empty Bed Blues,"" but anybody who can expose ""Leader of the Pack""'s exploration of the conflict between love and authority has a right.

Her fans may find some of the material on this live double-LP repetitious--I could do without five minutes of ""Delta Dawn"" myself--and her overripe singing will offend those she offends anyway. But she's never recorded fifteen of these twenty-five songs, a few repeats are enhanced by the particulars of this performance, and others gather meaning in theatrical context. A typical stroke: prefacing the glorious tearjerker ""Hello in There"" with campy, occasionally unkind patter about ladies with fried eggs on their heads, so that the song's romanticized heroine and the weird and depressing fried egg ladies both seem to have something in common with Bette, and therefore with each other.

When Midler covered the Dixie Cups and the Shangri-Las in 1972, she was reclaiming ""rock""'s female principle. So on this tribute and Christmas gift, the artist who did so much to make ""girl group"" a brand and a byword broadens its reach. In addition to mining the great American songbook of Goffin-King, Mann-Weill, and Holland-Dozier-Holland, she invites the foundational Boswell Sisters, the Cuban-born DeCastro Sisters, cover queens the Chordettes, and the Andrews Sisters singing in Yiddish to the party. She turns TLC's ""Waterfalls"" into a nightclub ballad and the Shangri-Las' ""Give Him a Great Big Kiss"" into a senior-care burlesque. Her wittingly lowbrow notion of class uncorrupted by her success, she sings every lyric like it's Cole Porter, or at least Irving Berlin, because in historical context it is. Midler recognizes no disconnect between good-humored sincerity and the idea that camp is a tender feeling. And she knows ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" is every bit as eloquent as ""They Can't Take That Away From Me.""

You'd figure the showiest of all gospel groups would sell out with some flair, but the vocal transfigurations--that old Wilson Pickett (and Julius Cheeks) unhh born again--aren't the only reason this is one of the best LPs ever to come out of Philadelphia. For once, the songs--many of them from producer Dave Crawford, whose spirit must have been moved--include virtually no filler, not even (especially not even) the one that takes off from the group's name.

On the purely aural, preverbal evidence--the sweet, precise harmonies and arrangements, the intent beat--you'd figure they were singing songs of love, or at least sexual mastery. Ditto from their foolish stage act. But in fact there are no broken hearts in these lyrics, only broken bodies, and the exultation is the exultation of oppression defied. In other words, this follows reggae conventions as Americans know it, and on a few cuts conventional is how it sounds.

The writing here rarely approaches the finished wit of the Ice anthologies, and just because Volume One is still available, don't assume it always will be. But consider that all this material dates to before he was 25. Most of the songs--recounting news stories, local happenings, life in the yard--are homely moments of social music, the sole love song a Christmas postcard to a spouse back home. But the homeliness isn't just charming. Singing about Bermuda shorts, a peeping Tom, Laika the satellite dog, or the Eric Williams government, Sparrow embodies a musical culture unlike any that's existed in the U.S., even in the South. It's like a griot society too irreverent for praise songs, with an admixture of pseudo-Brit sophistication that would suggest Anglo-India if it wasn't so earthy. And the studio bands definitely have some jam, as in the unkempt fanfare to the opening ""No, Doctor, No"" or the brief sax solo on ""Gun Slingers"" or the chorus crooning the title refrain to my favorite, ""Harry in the Piggery.""

Rather than bitches, cars, etc., they're about homologous voices twisting internal rhymes through associative verses, with the ""ad libs"" that punctuate line after line the payoff that's made them such a thing. Although sometimes these merely repeat the line's final word, that can be fun in itself, and it sets up the repeated jack-in-the-box joke of springing an improved alternative keyword instead.

Lyrically he goes for it too, including a ""Use Me"" he can sing forever. But that doesn't mean anyone else will, and I do wonder why the two most memorable lines by this certified improvement on R.

So "". . . goingtohell"" is about romantic love and human mortality, not eternal damnation, and ""gonna die young"" addresses not the brutalities of the thug life but the perils of the fast lane like Frank Ocean and the Eagles before it. Nor is the chiseled Afro-Hispanic the pure sex symbol some assume--that's why the porn-inspired ""the valley"" is followed by the domestic morning-after of ""coffee"" before it's trumped by some dickish fuckery he hands off to Kurupt. You could even say this recalls one of rock's endless succession of coming-of-age struggles. The straightforwardly confused ""what's normal anyway"" sums it up nicely. He is normal--because he ain't.

It's a puzzlement how country convention extracts so much heartbreak from the same pair, which isn't to say that ""Dirty Water"" and ""Out in the Rain"" don't bear a credible burden of sorrow.

With producer Jon Brion overdubbing band parts, these pretty-hooks-all-in-a-row end up too pick-'em-up-and-put-'em-down, and some of the lyrics are reductive, victims rather than bright clear examples of the high focus Miller sets his sights on. ""Things That Disappear,"" for instance, doesn't fuse mortality and splitsville the way it means to.

All but a few songs deal with differing facets of a tempestuous permanent relationship, and that includes the one where a matriarch with 49 strong male grandchildren turns 100 on her steel-clad colony planet in the year 2106. It's called ""Happy Birthday Don't Die,"" and I'm going to assume it's about Miller's daughter until he tells me to stop.

This music may recycle blues riffs, but its spirit is pure escapist pop; country living replaces surf and cars as utopian metaphor and Miller's voice, always too slight for real blues, sounds suitably out-of-it. As philosophy it's venal, but as unabashed diversion it's pretty nice. After all, was he ever good for anything else?

Far blander than Decca's other prerock crossovers, the Ink Spots, these sons of the barbershop cultivated normality whether they were guesting for Bing, accompanying Ella, or bringing ditties to market. The 16 songs here are as anonymous as they are memorable, just like the close blend of brothers who shared so much DNA that on record they could almost be one Mills plus overdubs. None of their army of imitators ever got near their generic sound.

FALSE,A-,Beam Me Up Scotty,Nicki Minaj,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15255,"
This 2009 mixtape, not the more recent Barbie World, is why if not where hards decided a biracial female was street enough. Without undue popping of coochie, she quickly establishes herself as a highly unsisterly, rabidly materialistic ""shopaholic"" set on becoming ""the black Hannah Montana."" That way of putting it should have alerted hoodrats unworthy of her hiney implants to the scope of her ambitions; on the other hand, so should ""behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly-girl."" Even her materialism is relative: ""Tell Michelle I got my eye on Barack Obama/Tryin' to get that Madonna/You know Hannah Montana [a theme?]/Could find me sittin' Indian-style with the Dalai Lama/I'm meditatin' I'm in cahoots with a higher power."" One does wonder, though--once you rhyme ""Dalai Lama"" and ""higher power,"" do you need Hannah Montana anymore?

Since the positive and negative reviews say pretty much the same thing, we can agree that this is an overstuffed, musically manipulative, thematically directionless bid to put the pink-haired alien on the singles charts until Katy Perry absconds to rehab. She isn't ""the female Weezy"" or some ill-defined male alter ego. She's an aspiring and most likely inevitable pop queen who raps exceptionally well, sings quite well, rhymes inconsistently but sometimes superbly, and will do anything to be rich and famous. This obviously doesn't make her a heroine. But if you enjoy contemporary pop whose market-tested blare offends both rockist philistines and IDM aesthetes, her second album is a worthwhile investment. It begins strong and, counting the three bonus tracks, ends strong. In between it tends mawkish and loud, neither of which precludes fun, especially with the right cameos. There is, however, a Chris Brown track. (Hey--I said anything.)

FALSE,A-,The Pinkprint (Deluxe Edition),Nicki Minaj,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16232,"
Sometimes gossip can be so enlightening. The reflective opener ""All Things Go"" is pretty solid on its own. But word that this particular best rapper alive just ended a 12-year relationship with her homeboy boyfriend renders the two ballads that work off that prologue touching. The bad part is that it doesn't render them major ballads, although she gets somewhat closer on ""Bed of Lies"" at the other end of the narrative arc before overblowing the supposedly climactic ""Grand Piano."" Only then come three album-defining bonus tracks. The Meek Mill-assisted ""Big Daddy"" is so generic it establishes how ungeneric the Drake/Weezy-assisted ""Only"" and the Lunchmoney Lewis-assisted ""Trini Dem Girls"" were--makes you want to play them again, in fact. And on ""Shanghai"" and ""Win Again,"" Minaj returns to her triumphalist mode prepared to embrace the role of a 32-year-old woman ready for love--even, in both songs, the motherhood she reflects on as the record begins.

Mingus's elitist aesthetic theories have always put me off his music, so when I'm told that the oldies on side one have been recorded with more fire in the past, I can only respond that now I'll want to hear them for myself.

If you can't vote yet you're still too old for their brains-to-the-wall barrage--it vents aggressions so immature they're barely articulate, triggered by the political frustration that makes voting so meaningless these days. But once you regain consciousness it'll leave you humming, in a fragmented kind of way. You like your rock hard, right? So why the hell aren't you curious?

Like the good orthodox category-haters you'd figure, these perverts claim they're not industrial, which is true only in the sense that Led Zeppelin wasn't metal: they may be too good for the category, but that doesn't mean they're not of it. And like Led Zep, they're cold bastards who are worth your time even if you think you don't like what they do, which is toning up your cardiovascular system by running you over with a tank. Their rockism is checked somewhat this time by a meticulousness that may put off casual sympathizers, but from synth-ooze to caterwaul, the care they put into their din connects as an aural wit that complements and undercuts their over-the-top doom-mongering. You don't laugh with them and you don't laugh at them--you just throw back your head in glee at the unlikely fact that they exist.

FALSE,A-,What Makes a Man Start Fires?,Minutemen,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3722,"
The lyrics are richer, bleaker, and smarter than the hardcore rant that softened the world up for this art band in disguise, but I prefer their music. The more you listen the less fragmentary these eighteen tense little guess-you-have-to-call-them tunes sound--each transforms its own riff into an identity that meshes with the album's guess-you-have-to-call-it gestalt. Since they're not purist (or unpop) enough to resist putting the strongest material first, their steady-state kineticism does lose a notch or two of stress as each side proceeds, but that's the only way they could work it--any kind of climax would be too romantic for these guys.

These guys define the future of atavism if anybody does. Subtle structures and sharp musicianship--rhythm-slasher D. Boon is as much a guitar antihero as labelmates Bob Mould and Greg Ginn--serves music that continues to seem primitive, even crudely offhand; lyrics articulate, elaborate, and, that's right, criticize the fucked-up despair of the world where they make their living and preach their uncoercive gospel--the fucked-up despair that in true hardcore makes such a great excuse for not thinking.

FALSE,A-,Double Nickels on the Dime,Minutemen,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3724,"
Maybe by designating a ""side chaff"" and aiming a boast at their four-sided labelmates (""take that, hï¿½ï¿½ï"") the L.A. (really San Pedro) punk-fusion (really ""chump rock""?) trio mean to acknowledge that a forty-six-song double-LP is overdoing things. But I have my faves throughout, topped by a Steely Dan cover that wouldn't have survived first weed, and I'm not sure I'd like them so much at a different pace. Eleven of the titles are over 2:00 and thirteen more over 1:40, but structures are still so abbreviated that the way one riff-song segues into the next changes both. This is poetry-with-jazz as it always should have been, and while D. Boon may be a somewhat limited singer, he's a hell of a reader, with a guitar that rhymes.
"
FALSE,A-,Ballot Result,Minutemen,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3727,"
As someone who's never had much patience with the mystique of the ill-recorded moment, music overheard just before it slips into the historical void its creators figure it for, I'll make a partial exception for the Minutemen, because I miss them so much. I know most of the songs on this mostly live double in versions I prefer, but better than any studio distillation it underlines the crucial point: they lived. And given the modesty so intrinsic to their world-historical public ambitions, its muffled, take-a-flier intimacy speaks. Also, I like the covers.
"
FALSE,A-,Benga Blast!,Daniel Owino Misiani and Shirati Band,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=928,"
Not all that easy to tell this Kenya-recorded '80s-spanning compilation from Shirati Jazz's London-recorded 2/11/87 Benga Beat even though Misiani is missing from the earlier release, which consists entirely of material penned and cut/recut by members of the band he continued to lead 25 years after he invented it. Quality does emerge: Misiani's writing is catchier, and he's good for an extra measure of vocal and instrumental authority despite the U.K. production's superior audio. But what defines both is the still-delicate benga sound, uncommonly folkish for modern Afropop even though the soukous competition has prodded it toward what passes in Kenya for revisionist HI-NRG. Sweet and beaty.
"
FALSE,A-,The King of History,D.O. Misiani and Shirati Jazz,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15235,"
This rebellious, outspoken, girl-happy Tanzanian Luo put himself in the forefront of Kenya's Luo-speaking benga style in his late twenties and was in his forties by the time two Shirati Jazz albums were released Stateside in the '80s, which was also when both were recorded. So just as Benga Blast!, a selection of Kenyan singles, bubbled more irresistibly than Benga Beat, cut later in London, the added effervescence of the chattering guitar and hyperactive bass on these 13 '70s dance tunes speaks well of Misiani's youth. Most of the front-loaded ones are social commentary, but about midway through six women's names bum-rush the track listing. Misiani had four wives and died in 2006--the victim, like his fellow Luo Barack Obama Sr., of an automobile accident. He was still recording.

""Unreleased and hard to find,"" 1995-2002--and as such, choppy. But also, undie or not, catchy. With his neat timbre and big fat dreads, Lif specializes in black science, but that doesn't mean he rhymes as consistently as, to cite one freestyle target, Jay-Z. ""I burn off your flesh like David Koresh"" wicked, ""I'm getting physical like fitness"" not, ""Niggers want their frankincense and myrrh back"" complex, ""These type of facts I don't tend to shun/So I press into the universe to defend the sun"" unnatural.

"
FALSE,A-,Ladies of the Canyon,Joni Mitchell,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1839,"
Joni's new dependence on piano implies a move from the open air to the drawing room--or at least living area--that's reflected in richer, more sophisticated songs. Sometimes the wordplay is still laughably high school--""lookout thru the pain"" my eye. But ""Both Sides Now"" was only the beginning, and this album offers at least half a dozen continuations, all in different directions. Side two leads off with songs to a (real) FM DJ and a (figurative?) priest and includes her versions of ""Woodstock"" and ""The Circle Game"" as well as my own favorite, ""Big Yellow Taxi,"" an ecology song with a trick ending.
"
FALSE,A-,Hits,Joni Mitchell,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1849,"
Would it were modesty that inspired her to release the hour-long Hits and Misses rather than the usual multi-CD doorstop. But given that she's fed her enormous ego hunks of what was once an equally enormous talent for 20 years now, figure the opposite. Unable to abide the thought of superceding any portion of her catalogue, much less adjudging some of it less worthy than the rest, the Grammy-winning Billboard and BMI awardee elected to concentrate beloved older songs in one compilation and leaden newer ones in another. The result is an uncommonly fabulous educational tool for the Ani DiFranco fan on your list that does more for the two post-1980 items it tacks on than Misses does for the seven that weigh it down. But since the cream of the 15 selections can also be found on her four prime early-'70s albums--For the Roses, Court and Spark, Blue, and Ladies of the Canyon--it's docked a notch for inutility.
"
FALSE,A-,Both Sides Now,Joni Mitchell,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1850,"
My favorite Joni story is that they tried to do a TV special on her and none of her old friends would pitch in. Even if it's a dumb rumor or a damned lie, it's a hell of a metaphor for someone who loves herself so much nobody else need bother, and yet another reason to scoff at her concept song cycle about the rise and fall of an affair. But after decades of pretentious pronouncements on art, jazz, and her own magnificence, this very if briefly great singer-songwriter proves herself a major interpretive singer. Lucky to write two decent songs a decade now, she instead applies her smoked contralto to a knowledgeable selection of superb material by mostly second-echelon Tin Pan Alley craftsmen (and I do mean men). Splitting the difference between pop and jazz like the Chairman himself, she doesn't transform the melodies so much as texture them, and on a few highlights--on ""Comes Love"" and ""You've Changed,"" on ""When love congeals/It soon reveals/The faint aroma of performing seals""--she bores so deep into the words you'd think she'd written them herself back when she had something to say. But no, that's ""A Case of You"" and ""Both Sides Now""--both of which, you can bet the mortgage, she makes sure belong.

FALSE,A-,McKinley Mitchell,McKinley Mitchell,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2322,"
A small miracle: Bobby Bland meets Brook Benton in the timeless realm of the not-quite-folkloric, where soul and blues sound precisely contemporary and strings voice old horn riffs with no suggestion of sellout. Mitchell's seven tunes don't measure up to the other three--""Dream Lover,"" ""You're So Fine,"" and a classic blues from the early '70s called ""Open House at My House."" But it doesn't matter, because this is one of those groove records on which ordinary songwriting is transmuted by perfect pacing and unshakable stylistic conviction.

FALSE,A-,Be the Cowboy,Mitski,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17436,"
Fourteen structurally cunning, melodically engaging, verbally coherent songs that for a compact 33 minutes address romantic angst from a disquieting angle. When women dig into their love lives men usually come out the bad guys, as they should, because men mistreat and undervalue the women they're with much more than vice versa. But the few times the singer tries to reconnect with an unattainable ex she blames the disconnect on herself because she made the approach, and more often she's the unattainable one and wishes she wasn't. The lead ""Geyser"" hints that the culprit is the music she's hung up on instead, and in ""Remember My Name"" that becomes explicit: ""I gave too much of my heart tonight/Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love/That I can save till tomorrow's show?"" But her loneliness is so ingrained that it's just as likely she got stuck on music because human love felt beyond her to begin with. That's why she's so disquieting, and so original. But by definition it doesn't make her more lovable.

Ignore techno all you want, you'll still be stuck with Moby. Surrounded by meaningless glitz, he's subtle not so he won't offend but because he thinks musical sensationalism is a means to spiritual exaltation. And because he's subtle he'll be large--sooner or later he'll devise something else as universal as ""Go,"" and when he does his label will be prepared to cross it over. Meanwhile there's this half-hour foray into the big time, keyed to the divaesque title anthem and including electronic tribal drums, drumless atmospherics, and a six-minute symphony you can dance to.
"

Is it strange that a studio wizard of Moby's evident genius makes such flawed records? Not if he's really a dancefloor wizard--not if the communal-ecstatic is his artistic ground. Where in concert he subsumes rockist guitar and classical pretensions in grand, joyous rhythmic release, on album his distant dreams remain tangents. ""What Love"" challenges Metallica as incidentally as ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" does Philip Glass, and all I can say for sometime cocomposer Mimi Goese is that she sounded even prissier in Hugo Largo. Martha Wash, call your agent. I mean, he's a Christian, girl.

To his credit, the hustling little visionary didn't go for an ingratiating follow-up. With the vocals proffering all the human comfort of a loony bin, the hortatory punk with which he betrays his appointed calling assails the central nervous system even more abrasively than his electroraves did. I mean, why do you think they call both styles hardcore? But on the one-CD U.S. version the calmer techno his U.K. label relegated to a bonus disc cuts the speed-rock sex and desperation, so that the two musics enrich and play off each other with the flow and coherence Everything Is Wrong lacks (meaningfully, perhaps by design, but lacks nevertheless). ""Alone"" wouldn't assuage the way it does if just minutes earlier he hadn't been swearing ""When you're fucking me it powers up my soul"" in his best messiah-cum-ubermensch monotone.

You'd think the little egomaniac had made some version of this elegiac, atmospheric, predominantly instrumental album before. He's always had a weakness for quiet grandeur, a knack too, and his very first longform was called Ambient. But in fact the style of beauty here is something new for him, and though the album may seem contemplative, depressive is probably more like it--desolate even. What lyrics there are mourn absence and loss, and many of the effects are achieved by fabricating and then calibrating dirty sonics both electronic and organic. My Bloody Valentine obsessives should check it out--though it is prettier, a spiritual accomplishment and a relief.

The country-rock harbingers, especially on side two, are depressing at first, but you realize soon enough that this stands as a classic pop rock and roll record, recalling a time when ""pop"" was a concept conducive to the kind of raving intensity three guitars and five voices tuned all the way up are (or were) good for.

Was there a more galvanic live band in Haight-era San Francisco than this biz-fabricated quintet of Seattle and LA interlopers, who coalesced to record a dynamite debut they spent the rest of their lives trying to wrest from their manager? Maybe not. The Detroit primitivism of Big Brother's James Gurley rode the jazz-schooled beat of David Getz, and for quite a while there the Dead's Bill Kreutzmann was just a kid. But the chops of these doomed young pros, every one of whom could sing and write terse, catchy, well-structured songs, were powered by one of the scene's few true rock drummers, Don Stevenson. So as five voices trade leads on 19 selections from five 1966-69 gigs (including their forgotten opening slot at a Monterey Pop Festival they should have been smack in the middle of), their controlled distortion and power melodies obliterate the wet noodling and wispy lyricism of the ""ballroom"" ex-folkies who considered them phonies. Here be a B.B. cover, long and short versions of the ecstatic ""Omaha,"" and a freakout that proves how much they wanted to fit in. And everywhere there's Stevenson, reminding them to keep it loud as they keep it moving. Quicksilver Messenger Service was never like this.

And until these become the exclusive province of undistinguisheds and indistinguishables like, oh, Versus or Polvo, I'll crow about every exception. Skirting the professional class they were born to for a poverty that's real if voluntary, these three youngsters are probably wise-asses, probably thieves. But their songs never quit even when they're divided into the kind of stylistic segments that usually irritate the hell out of me. Although their glimpses of a cockroach world living on its own discards may seem jejune to some and homely to others, the lyrics are observed, informed, and explicit enough--in fact, as brave and beautiful as the blues, albeit at a more rarefied level of cultural specificity.

But if Pavement has truly checked out, these Washington State youngsters can carry the noize-toon torch. Although ""Sleepwalkin'"" is kinda sexy, we understand why Up never released that ""Never Ending Math Equation"" video. As noize-toon, however, they're irreproachable--dissonant, vulnerable, geeky, and, crucially, sweet where so many other dissonantly vulnerable geeks arm themselves with sarcasm.

Pop craftsmen combat this truth, or lie about it, by fashioning antientropic modules within which a salutory dose of abandon can do its work, while keepers of the avant-garde tradition walk into a collapsing building and plug in their amps. An infinity of further choices awaits both camps, and most of them are wrong. Mofungo's are right: pride rather than self-congratulation, anger rather than loathing, struggle rather than despair. Both funny and witty, unassumingly compassionate, glancing fondly off the folk musics they look to and the rock they play, they sound less weird and inchoate the more you listen.

FALSE,A-,An American Compilation,Nils Petter Molvaer,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13524,"
Molvaer is a Norwegian trumpeter formerly on ECM who during the past decade has proven himself a sonic hipster as unflappable as Miles Davis himself. Peter Gordon's electronica-friendly nu-jazz label, Thirsty Ear, introduces its new prize to his natural audience by bearing down on Molvaer's Europe-only 2002 NP3 and front-loading the title tune of ECM's 2001 release Solid Ether. This overplays Molvaer's interest in power funk and pretty solos, but what the hell--he's always shifting tactics anyway, and there's still atmospheric ambience aplenty.
"
FALSE,A-,ER,Nils Petter Molvaer,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13525,"
On the spookiest of Thirsty Ear's three Molvaer albums, Molvaer's Miles-sans-mute sound--smooth the way strawberry sherbet is smooth--floats through buzzes and washes, squiggles and treated voices, bodied up by bass parts often his own. Not that he's a loner--most tracks feature four to six samplers, programmers, drummers and such. Here's hoping the woman who sings (and wrote) ""Only These Things Count"" is another respected fellow professional, rather than his girlfriend. Miles reserved his girlfriends for cover shots.

FALSE,A-,Streamer,Nils Petter Molvaer,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13526,"
Recorded at a Jan. 1, 2002, Finnish concert where some audience members surely dozed briefly unless the heat was on the fritz, this is pretty lulling for a live album--assuming the ground of your being isn't threatened by guitar blats, jungle beats and noises that poke out of the flow like tree branches and old car parts. It includes five compositions that had just then surfaced on NP3, only here they're gauzier. Due to the spoken-word snatches the trumpeter strews on top, they're also eerier. But not, I promise, scarier.

FALSE,A-,Baboon Moon,Nils Petter Molvaer,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15493,"
Recorded live in the studio with a worldly-wise drummer and a sonic guitarist who adds some modest Teo Macero moves, this is less techno and dubby than the trumpeter's norm, in its many quieter moments evoking the exotica stylings of Jon Hassell. ""Recoil"" lifts into a riff-driven guitar workout at track three before the music recedes back into contemplation, with Molvaer varying his embouchure and the drums all demonstrative as the guitar seeks out effects. Then the seven-minute title track goes all in on a crowd-pleasing finale. He's always a little too subtle. But in a way that's always the point.

Finally Monï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿""android"" mask, for me a relief, and comes out as a woman-loving woman, for me no surprise insofar as I'd thought about it at all. But she calls herself ""pansexual"" as opposed to ""gay"" or ""bi"" because she wants it all. Too often prosex albums are shallow. While remaining intellectual, this one is more personal than the android dared.

So my salsa-playing brother-in-law listens for a while and chides me indulgently for once again preferring African clave to the real thing. Not so abashed I don't remain into what I'm into, I think I hear what he means--the groove here is simultaneously more emphatic and more contained than in the Eddie Palmieri he's always promoting and the charanga he pops in now. Only as it turns out, these five tracks, which I have as an unannotated burn, were cherry-picked from circa-1980 sessions in which nasal, Cuba-born Monguito El Unico united chesty, Gambia-born Laba Sosseh with NYC salsa hotshots. In Dakar, Sosseh was a giant, supremely danceable in an era when salsa was the chosen music of the newly independent elite. In U.S.A., he was an exotic. This bypasses Sosseh's signature ""Aminata"" and ""La Bicycletta."" But the synergy of the two contrasting voices--plus, assuming the inevitable Nuyorican rub-off, three slightly different conceptions of clave--makes for yet another seductive variation on the Senegambian tinge. Not easy to find, and I've now heard other music by both Sosseh and Monguito that seems worth exploring. But this will always be where I started.

FALSE,A-,Dolmen Music,Meredith Monk,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11402,"
Monk has classical voice training, but I expect it was her folk and rock experience that taught her how to make these almost wordless songs sound so demotic, so literally unrefined--they obviously don't merely ""express"" emotion, but they don't merely distill it either. On record, the ostinato structures mean that the four shorter pieces composed between 1972 and 1975 come across better than the title work, which lasts 23:39 and features six voices with intermittent accompaniment. But anybody who wants to go further than Lora Logic and Pere Ubu will listen to it all.

A pricey French import that targets serious fans like me, so why not you? Recorded down by the riverside in Weehawken because Monk wasn't together or perhaps even interested enough to get to France, this unsynchronized 1959 ""soundtrack"" for a sexed-up Roger Vadim rip of the 1782 novel of the same name offers no new compositions but several this-time-onlys as it deploys the exceptional rhythm section of bassist Sam Jones and drummer Art Taylor and on some tracks a second saxophonist named Barney Wilen to texture Charlie Rouse's breathy imperturbality. Toward the end comes a brief improvisation entitled ""Light Blue"" that later resurfaced as ""Round Lights"" and a brief reading of the Charles Tindley hymn ""We'll Understand It By and By"" by the same pianist who spent two teen years woodshedding with a gospel show. And then there's the bonus disc, which really is for fans only, like the one I know who can't get enough of the 14-minute ""Light Blue (making of),"" which consists entirely of Taylor trying to get the tune's bluntly off-kilter beat straight.

Run through these nine originals a few times and eventually you'll accept that the Pistol Annies are a trio for good reason and her solo debut is unlikely to top ""Two Weeks Late,"" which is about the rent only in the end it isn't. Then slowly you'll realize just how rare it is for a major-label Nashville hopeful to put this much care into every song even if you're not convinced by the one that connects whipped cream and whips. Then you'll check out co-writes--Guy Clark, Lori McKenna, hmm. And then you'll wonder who Sally Barris is, 'cause she helped out on a heartsong called ""Used"" that completes if not tops ""Two Weeks Late.""

FALSE,A-,RCA Country Legends,Bill Monroe,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12216,"
Barraged for years with acoustic country music of every region, era, concept of reality, and elevation above sea level, my lifelong resistance to bluegrass has weakened--the old autonomous nervous system perks up of its own accord when I segue from natural-born archivist Roscoe Holcomb, say, to this certified genius. But while I also brighten at Classic Bluegrass From Smithsonian Folkways, I notice more details on the equally inauthentic Classic Old-Time Music, which may explain my special attraction to this transitional collection, from before the style Monroe fabricated knew its name or Earl Scruggs. Virtuoso stuff without the intense harmonies, precise interlocks, and competitive showmanship that make goo-goo eyes at slickness on the Columbia comps and MCA's post-Flatt &amp; Scruggs Country Music Hall of Fame Series, these 1940-41 recordings share a sense of innocent fun with the mountain music Monroe was just then jazzing up. The piety and pain are palpable; occasionally a beat stumbles or a voice cracks. You can understand why Monroe wanted something better for himself. You're just not sure he was right.

A featured artist in the John Turturro documentary Passione!, Montecorvino is a Neapolitan actress born in 1962 whose recording career began at 30. This album, dated 2003 on my copy, has seen at least four releases since then, and as music solely, with no lyrical clues beyond titles with ""luna"" and ""mare"" in them, its understatement is riveting. What Montecorvino wants the world to hear is the beatwise romantic grit of the Maghreb, where so many of her home port's most recent immigrants began their hard lives, reinvigorating the sweet romantic melody Napoli's emigrants sentimentalize. Though usually the percussion and guitar sound Euro-American, at times you can hear ouds and darbukas in there, and Elvis fans need to know what she makes of ""O sole mio.""

Greil Marcus wrote Lipstick Traces over the background buzz of the comedy albums where most of this music first appeared, but I feed my absurdism jones more cautiously. So I'll save these 14 songs plus 11 jokes/fragments for whenever the specter of cosmic frailty starts getting me down--at least 20 of them tickled me first time through, and half still make me smirk four or five plays later. Rarely has any professional wag, singing group, or existentialist philosopher showed off his, her, or their reading like these too, too mortal polymaths. Their idea of a good joke is a pimple on the Milky Way or a king with his head cut off. Sex, race, and class also interest them.

There's no rationalizing the success ratio of this tribute comp--I mean, gosh, Elvis Presley's original sidemen collaborate with artists who like them. I'd like to credit Scotty and D.J.'s groove, but with second drummers powering the two rockingest cuts and extra guitarists everywhere, let's just call it serendipity. Plus maybe--since Joe Ely, Steve Earle, and Raul Malo all benefit from not trying too hard--the kind of affable discretion that stays out of talent's way. The knockout rockouts are Cheap Trick's ""Bad Little Girl,"" which sounds like great John Lennon, and Keith Richards and the Band's ""Deuce and a Quarter,"" which sounds like great old roots-rock and also like nothing I've ever heard. And then there's Ronnie McDowell with that essential soupcon of Memphis-to-Vegas schmaltz.

FALSE,A-,Demolished Thoughts,Thurston Moore,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15415,"
Just like Paul Simon, Moore constructs a singer-songwriter album where the attraction is, of all things, the music. Stranger still, it's the guitar strumming. Just as Moore's tunings sharpen noise-rock intellectually, they tone up pretty-folk physically--as do Samara Lubelski's violin and producer Beck Hansen's synths. The melodies are strong, and Moore's murmur serves them well. But ultimately singer-songwriters are supposed to deliver lyrics, and unlike Simon's, these come with postage due. Beyond ""Benediction""'s comfort and ""Orchard Street""'s flaming youth, confusion is still sex in Moore's philosophy. For all we can tell, he thinks it's love, too.

Ooh, Eminem, scary. You want a rap record to terrify your ass, how about one with a street anthem about robbing niggaz? Socially redeeming characteristic: will discourage young African American men from wearing jewelry. Billy Danze is the coarse-grained DMX bellower with the crazy laugh, Lil' Fame his rugged sidekick. Wielding brazen, unrelenting samples, they attack like a firing squad on a spree, with a fierce joy Guns N' Roses would abjure hard drugs for. As is no secret, I hate gangsta rap-hate its smugness, its brutality, its cool, its lies, its contempt for the ordinary, its failure to provide role models for young African American men. But this specimen convinces me that, sometimes, thugs have more fun-get large in the ways that matter by shitting on anybody they fucking feel like. I scoff at ""guilty pleasures,"" too. Pleasure is nothing to feel guilty about. This may be.

Batamba Wendo Morris was born in Patrice Lumumba's east Congo hometown in 1955 and died at 38 having migrated to East Africa itself like such fellow Congolese musicians as Samba Mapangala, with whom he sang for a while in a rough baritone pitched so luxuriously low some call it a bass. When he was leading the band, he not only made sure the guitars slackened soukous's high-tension-wire acrobatics in the casual Kenyan-Tanzanian manner but generally gave a single saxophone its say. Recorded in his home base of Nairobi, the 1983 title album comprises four nine-minute tracks, the most notable the half-English closer and ""Kaka Puneira Wivu"" with its drolly twangy second guitar. The clattery plus two are from 1977, with Tabu Ngongo horning in irrepressibly. A good groove is had by all.

If ""pop"" means anything anymore, it ain't this. As a SoundScan-certified megadeal, she's outgrown the bright appeal of pop the way she's outgrown the punky abrasions that gave the debut its traction off the blocks. The mammoth riffs, diaristic self-analysis, and pretentious Middle Eastern sonorities of this music mark it as ""rock,"" albeit rock with tunes. And in this context I suck it up, feeling privileged to listen along with all the young women whose struggles Morissette blows up to such a scale. Here's hoping lots of young men feel the same.

Once dissed as the voice of pseudofeminist exploitation, Morissette was in fact a thinking original in a showbiz context she had the stuff to make something of. The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge Glen Ballard got on the debut and the expansive grandeur he manufactured for the follow-up. But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy, crunching out a guitar riff and then revealing 21 ""not necessarily needs but things that I prefer"" in a lover. Stretching out il-lu-si-on and for-med to suit scansion or mood, opposing capital punishment and coming out for sex ""more than three times a week,"" topping memorable verse with indelible chorus, she's a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants, exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for. Whatever the biographical details, I hear love songs to a narcissist, an old flame, an ""employee"" (has anyone used that word in a song before?), plus a self-doubt anthem for perspective and gorgeous regrets for pathos. Even when the forced pronunciations turn gauche, she remains a good egg who's not afraid to put herself on the line.

Eccentric even for a city that brags about its eccentrics, Austinite Blaze Foley inspired Lucinda Williams's ""Drunken Angel"" and had the best luck of his star-crossed career when Merle Haggard made ""If I Could Only Fly"" the title song of an excellent 2000 comeback album that didn't sell much. By then he'd been dead a decade, killed by the gun-toting son of a friend he was standing up for. His legend hasn't been helped by master tapes that kept getting lost, stolen, or seized by federal agents, but on these 15 songs his guitarist friend Gurf gets to cherry-pick and hook up with a drummer. Irresistible as John Prine for an opening section capped by the homelessness ditty ""No Goodwill Stores in Waikiki,"" they sink into a slough of despond that starts feeling right comfy before the record rises up with ""Small Town Hero,"" in which the duct tape abuser gets the last word on the high school sports star. Foley never mistook his dysfunction for a cause or felt sorry for himself about anything but women, and even there not much. He made his bed wherever.

""Jackie Wilson said it was reet petite,"" he shouts for openers, and soon has me believing that ""I'm in heaven when you smile"" says as much about the temporal and the eternal as anything in Yeats. ""Listen to the lion,"" he advises later, referring to that lovely frightening beast inside each of us, and midway through the eleven-minute cut he lets the lion out, moaning and roaring and growling and stuttering in a scat extension that would do Leon Thomas proud.

After a period of transition, Van has finally achieved the eternal Kansas City--this music is purely gorgeous (or at times lovely), its pleasure all formal grace and aptness of invention.

Like it or not, Morrison's genre exercises are kind of boring. Having long since sold his soul to his Muse, he's her slave for life, and though he keeps importuning various gods to loose his chains, the best they can offer is extra inspiration once in a while--now, for instance. Cliff Richard's support on his liveliest tune since ""Cleaning Windows"" suggests that Christ the Redeemer is lending a hand, but on the first side Van prefers to find the divine in the blessed present--folk lyric, poem about birdwatching, song called ""I'd Like To Write Another Song."" Side two comes out more today-is-the-first-day-of-the-rest-of-Van's-life--that is, his own genre exercise. And for a side he gets away with it.

Now getting on to grizzled, he seeks guidance from the kas of Doc Pomus and King Pleasure and ""The Lonesome Road,"" an unutterably sad spiritual recast as an upbeat vibraphone feature. And especially, on three cuts, his old soulmate John Lee Hooker, who doesn't come close to sounding overexposed on Them's ""Gloria"" and Sonny Boy's ""Good Morning Little Schoolgirl"" and something new by Van called ""Wasted Years,"" about how the dumb stuff is behind them now.

I hope someday he learns that what made Chuck Berry better than Elvis Presley wasn't soul, even if that rhymes with rock and roll the way Rolling Stones rhymes with (guess who he prefers) Nina Simone. But the wealth of good-hearted reflection and well-calibrated production overwhelms one's petty objections.

Musically, Mos Def has always been a little dull--so caught up in his own smarts he let verbal flow carry his albums. Here the defining flow is sonic--a shadowy, guitar-drenched tone poem of the streets. Songs transmute into raps as the album shifts from Black Jack Johnson blues-metal toward smoother beats that quote Hair and twice reference What's Going On in mix and mood as well as content before building to a soulish horn band, some catchy rock nonsense overdubbed entirely by Mos Def, a heart ballad he very nearly sings, and a party-ready requiem cum call to action. ""My work is personal, I'm a workin' person/I put in work, I work with purpose,"" he reminds anyone who would reduce ""hard work"" to a right-wing slogan. But an equally telling lyric on an album whose secret hero is Bad Brains' Dr. Know is a silly one: ""Black Jack Johnson NYC/R-O-C-K-I-N-G.""

At first you don't believe anything this simple can also be this cunning, but unlike the Fall, say, Moses is nothing like an amateur, and neither, Jah knows, are his instrumentalists. He's also kind and hopeful, not vain enough to dream his music could tear Babylon down: just wants to grant us a glimpse of paradise before it goes.

Tracy Nelson doesn't touch everyone, but once she does, she carries you away. She can be sexual and spiritual not successively but on the same note and breath; she seems to suffer and to transcend suffering simultaneously. Vocally, Mother Earth is now Tracy Nelson, and although in theory I miss the male voices--especially Robert St. John's, whose songwriting always added something too--I'm not really complaining. Yet this record is a slight disappointment. I love it, but I know that my prejudices are strong and that only once--on her own composition, ""Andy's Song""--does Tracy burst calmly into free space as she does so often on the two previous Mother Earth lps and on Tracy Nelson Country. Recommended unequivocally to her cadre and equivocally to the benighted.

The critics who used to call Motorhead the worst band in the world had a point, which may be why Lemmy's high-speed metal has now turned into the thinking person's headbang. The stuff is so pure it's almost rarefied: no operatic declamations, no schlocky guitaristics, no satanism or medievalism or sci-fi or sexist s&amp;m. Just aggression, violence, noise. Lemmy doesn't even bellow--his voice is more a hoarse, loud, one-note roar. This tasteful two-disc best-of-plus-four (new and definitive: ""Killed By Death"") is the first Motorhead product praised by Headheads since No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith, eight of whose eleven songs it includes (the eight best, too). Unless you've got an extra Y chromosone or beat your meat till it bleeds, you likely don't need it on a regular basis. But it'll sure come in handy at those precious moments when you want nothing so much as to smash somebody's face.

I admire metal's integrity, brutality, and obsessiveness, but I can't stand its delusions of grandeur--the way it apes and misapprehends reactionary notions of nobility. One thing I like about Lemmy is that he's proud to be a clod, common as muck and dogged in his will to make himself felt as just that. Add that rarest of metal virtues, a sense of humor, which definitely extends to the music's own conventions, as on the lead cut of his first album in three litigation-packed years: yclept ""Deaf Forever,"" a good enough joke right there (especially for Sabbaf fans), it turns out to be a battlefield anthem--about a corpse. And then add Bill Laswell, who was born to make megalomania signify: where most metal production gravitates toward a dull thud that highlights the shriek of the singer and the comforting reverberation of the signature guitar, Laswell's fierce clarity cracks like a whip, inspiring Lemmy, never a slowpoke in this league, to bellow one called ""Built for Speed."" Result: work of art.

Though he's shed Bill Laswell's sonic entourage and rehired the lovable Philthy Animal Taylor to beat skins, Lemmy's brush with perfectionism seems to have transformed his recording philosophy. That layer of grunge is just gone, excised by the sharp vocal and percussive attack that made Orgasmatron the onslaught they'd promised for so long. Songwriting's still there, too, though ""Eat the Rich,"" which ends up with Lemmy's rig on the menu, is the closest it comes to transmuting metal the way ""Deaf Forever"" did. Guest divine: Michael Palin, who prays for trousers.

Ten hunks of meat tossed to a horde of ravening Finns, and if six of them surfaced all too recently on Nuevo Motorhead's two studio albums, that doesn't stop me from scarfing down this live one the way Old Motorhead's cult devoured No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith. No remorse, and no excuses, except to remark that Nuevo Motorhead has songwriting down. Further evidence: the very underground smash ""Killed by Death"" (if you want one, Lemmy says he has 10,000 of them in his house) and the never-before-recorded ""Just Because You Got the Power,"" which rages against the moneyheads without kidding anybody about capitalist hegemony.

Sonically retrograde and philosophically advanced, this is the testimony of a mad raver at peace with his lot in the world--but not with the world, not by a long shot. As Pete Solley muddies the mix back toward classic grunge, Lemmy rages against war--sometimes in so many words, sometimes by metaphorical imprecation, sometimes by standing tall amid the barrage. But an embittered artiste he's not--riding their iron horses into the sunset, tributes to L.A., Rio, and the Ramones prove he knows how good he's got it, and prove it full-throttle.

In a cheap, foolproof simulation of life after death, Lemmy's pals assemble a selection of cover versions so obvious Donald Trump Jr. could have thought of half of them. Ramon""Rockaway Beach""! Sex Pistols? ""God Save the Queen""! Stones is harder, so how about ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and ""Jumping Jack Flash""?! T.A. Nugent?

FALSE,A-,All the Young Dudes,Mott the Hoople,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2468,"
Those enamored of the dirty sound Guy Stevens got out of (or imposed on) this band complain that David Bowie's production is thin and antiseptic, but I always found their Atlantic albums fuzzy, and anyway, the material is powerful enough to overwhelm such quibbles. Mick Ralphs and Verden Allen make catchy. Bowie's title tune captures the spirit of a dispossessed younger (than me, Bowie, or Mott the Hoople) generation united by a style against time. The Velvet Underground cover is definitive. And Ian Hunter does more than get away with a long, slow, pretentious one at the close--""Sea Diver"" is a triumph.

Ian and the boys are definitely too self-referential, and they don't entirely convince me that they've earned our credence as the great failed band of the new loser mythology. But as rock and roll this is damn near irresistible, sure to stand as a textbook of killer riffs 'n' hooks. Even the throwaways are ace, except maybe for Mick Ralphs's Spanish guitar showcase. And not only has Ian's Dylan fixation become funny, but Ian knows it.

Hits my ass. Never heard ""Foxy Foxy"" on the radio, and never want to. But the other new one, ""Saturday Gigs,"" recapitulates quite movingly a banal theme this collection fleshes out with real wallop: a band and its fans. Four songs is too much overlap with Mott, but this is the essence of Mott the Hoople as a group, which always needed Ian Hunter and always did more than back him up.

If you want to name your songs ""1 Samuel 15:23,"" ""Psalms 40:2,"" and so forth, perhaps it would be kind to reproduce--not the lyrics, too vulgar I know, but the verses cited. It was only after I took the trouble to read each one before listening that the album came into focus, which blurred within tolerable range when I replayed it without my trusty King James at hand. Some of these songs hold up dandy by themselves: the one keyed to the exit from Eden in which a divorced husband steals back into the house he couldn't make a home, or the ""good and faithful servant"" one that chronicles a cancer death. But exegesis by contrast is the basic strategy. Message: The punishments God's minions threaten you can count on, but when they promise grace, figure life will trip you up big-time anyway. This is literary rock as it should be. John Darnielle knows it's not enough to write. You have to think, too.

As interested parties didn't need me to tell them, John Darnielle's latest is a concept album about the professional wrestlers of his '70s youth. The romanticization of the grotesque not being my thing, I have no inkling which stories are legendary and which extrapolations. But I like them all. I thank Darnielle for naming like-father-like-son Chavo Guerrero as he wages his battle against evil and Bull Ramos as he holds onto his whip for dear life. But the anonynous ferocity of ""Werewolf Gimmick"" and camaraderie of ""Animal Mask"" are just as inspirational. And although the opener establishes a tender lyricism consonant with Darnielle's own, there's no mistaking the album's most indelible line: ""I will stab you in the eye with a foreign object."" That's the name of the song--""Foreign Object.""

I have reservations about any record that falls into the dubious category of hard rock for critics, but am willing to grant that to climax a side of music from Brobdingnag with a Johnny Cash imitation is to show truly transcendent chutzpah. In fact, after brief acclimatization I like every cut. What seemed forced on Looking On now seems comic--there are parodies here of everything from weedy Yes-style vocals and wimpy Baby-style acoustics to rockabilly and music hall. And melodic moves that sounded glued on now seem integral. Recommended to those who like the idea of Grand Funk Railroad better than the reality.

""Do Ya""--rated single of the year in the rock press, apparently the only place it was distributed--signals a phase in the Move's career that comprises four songs, three uncharacteristically rock-and-rolly and all prime. Most of what remains here was first released on the more exotic Message From the Country (already a cut-out), which I also admire. Consistently good stuff, although the styles do grate.

Second time out they're obliged to prove their staying power--not just produce a new batch of sure shots, but add the weight of a few slow grooves and tokens of conscience, with no beginner's backlog or U.K. singles-only to fill in the blanks. So, as is only human, they don't go all the way. Michael Pickering and Steve Heard like to say that their songs are getting more soulful and meaningful, but the deepest meaning they have to offer is bound up in their formal commitment to what's most frivolous in classic disco--the fun positivity of Saturday night fever. Only the one about heroes is altogether leaden, and ""Drive Time"" is the radio move of every club band's prospectus. But where Elegant Slumming was pure pleasure machine, this stops at intensely likable--a band record rather than a producers' record, with trickier percussion and subtler hooks.

FALSE,A-,Shades of Purple,M2M,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2193,"
Believe it or not, there are three impossibly touching songs on this record, all at least cocomposed by 15-year-old Norwegian Marion Raven. ""Don't Say You Love Me,"" a minor hit from the Pokï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½""cute and all that,"" but she's not ready to get kissed or, for that matter, hear he loves her--after all, ""It's not like we're gonna get married."" Conceivably ""Girl in Your Dreams,"" which is all Raven's--""Maybe I don't have the blonde hair you like/Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky""--gets me because my daughter's a brunette, or maybe it's the way the melody meshes with the childish, just barely presexual burr in Raven's voice. And when ""Don't Mess With My Love"" takes her and 16-year-old Marit Larsen to where they have a love to defend, it's as if they've grown up right in front of your ears. But even when the writing is ordinary, the quality teenpop, some assembly-line and some personalized, is transfigured by the duo's singing. If the result isn't brazen or fizzy enough to suit the marketplace, then nuts to the marketplace. This is the kind of left-field gift crazes make possible.

A showbiz kid who broke in as a dancer, she followed a few late-'70s hits from Kinshasa to Abidjan and then Paris, where she cut her debut album in 1984. Truth to tell, her voice isn't a lot stronger than Paula Abdul's. But her music sure is, and though she does consult her arranger, hers he is--if the songwriting on this best-of doesn't prove her the most conceptually accomplished female musician in Africa, it certainly shows a hell of an ear. Varied and consistent. Catchy and uplifting. Pretty great.

Out of shrewdness or raw adaptability, this spectacular dancer and savvy singer knows how to find music that does her songs proud. Here she entrusts her Luba soukous to Sahel-salsa masterminds Ibrahim Sylla and Boncana Maiga for a modernization that altogether avoids Euroschlock. Coros and montunos dominate a groove that's cut with West African instrumentation and interrupted by soft ballads, with the standard Zairean guitar peals deployed so economically that when she breaks out a Pepe Kalle cover on the next-to-last cut, it's ecstasy. Pan-Africanism in action. Merry Whatever.

It beats her '60s cover if not the original, as does the pliant, weathered ""Me and My Chauffeur."" Sticking to underexposed blues songs and aided by a lifetime's worth of friends--Amos Garrett taking Lead Belly to the Delta, Angela Strehli working a ""cooperation plan,"" Alvin Youngblood Hart as Minnie's good old Kansas Joe--she turns in the best record of her undiminished lifetime.

The music here sounds so middle-Dylan that it inspired me to play Blonde on Blonde, after which unfair comparison I began to suspect Murphy of glibness. But although his themes aren't new and he does come at them like a know-it-all, that's not his fault--he does know quite a bit, maybe more than is good for him, and the quick phrases merely shield a plausible sincerity. Special concern: inter-relations between women's self-knowledge (and lack of it) and the emotional disappointments of sexual love. None of which you're obliged to notice until you enjoy the music a dozen times.

Rarely do I find much use for jazz that not only abandons theme but disdains melodic development, as both ""Obe"" (which runs 18 minutes) and (more modestly) ""Nevada's Theme"" do here. But Murray's saxophone and Lester Bowie's trumpet speak polymorphically enough to sustain simple interest, and to make up for the futuristic abstractions there's ""Bechet's Bounce,"" a gently satiric, fiercely infectious Dixieland romp.

FALSE,A-,Morning Song,David Murray,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10303,"
No concept here, and not much composition. Just three days in the studio with John Hicks, Reggie Workman, and Ed Blackwell, and not until the 11-minute version of Murray's only ordinary tune does it descend to the high level of convention you'd expect of such personnel. Murray ranges from terrific to transcendent (on Butch Morris's frenzied ""Light Blue Frolic""), and during one passage Hicks turns into Cecil Taylor without surrendering any of his Hicksness. ""Jitterbug Waltz"" is the closest this comes to carnivalesque, but its driving swing and aural warmth should be all the body language you need.

Recommended recent jazz titles by this endlessly resourceful if suspiciously prolific recording artist include the Malcolm tribute-quickie MX (Red Baron), stirred and soured by Bobby Bradford's cornet, Saxmen (Red Baron), which knocks back Young-Rollins-Parker-Rouse-Stitt-Coltrane standards guaranteed to knock new jazz fans out, and Special Quartet (DIW/Columbia), featuring McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones to guess what conceptual end (start with Rhino's Coltrane box and proceed). I can also dig Shakill's II (DIW import), a less audaciously greasy follow-up to his first Don Pullen-drenched avant-lounge organ outing. But more to the pop point is the leap he takes here and on The Tip, cut during the same four-day burst: a funk band, period, or do I mean question mark-explanation point?! Imperfect for sure, but although I'd prefer it didn't swing so much, in fact the full-bodied confidence of the only-jazz that begins this set gives it the edge over The Tip, which never equals the Sly Stone and David Murray classics it takes off from. The drag throughout is keybman Robert Irving III, whose adoration of Joe Zawinul almost transforms The Tip into the darn good Weather Report album Murray's damn lucky this one ain't. The motorvator is bass-whomping Darryl Jones, who is all over this record once it gets going--most spectacularly on the loosey-goosey bass-clarinet workout ""Acoustic Octo Funk,"" where Irving has the common sense to imitate Pullen for a while. They should have made a single album out of all this--real pop pros know an an outtake when they hear one. But it frees both Branford Marsalis and Maceo Parker to go back where they came from.

What generally costs African-jazz fusion its spark is that for the principals, jazz is hegemonic. However admiring the American instigator, he feels he has something to teach, and however proud his African collaborators, they adjust. In this Dakar-recorded big-band project, Murray and his New York cohort do the adjusting. After leading off with a typically attention-getting sax showcase, he hands the rhythms over to the mbalax-tinged Dieuf Dieul band and surrenders center stage to matched clarions Tidiane Gaye, Doudoud N'Daiye Rose, and Baaba Maal's brother Hamet; Dakar rappers Positive Black Soul; and the very New York-sounding Amiri Baraka. This music swings only as part of the total package, which has more forthright and complex beats to make its own.

Like so many undie hip-hoppers, especially black ones, Murs sells common sense where the big boys deal mythology. He avoids beef until his best friend comes under the gun, has trouble making the rent and trouble holding onto a buck, and comes up with advice for the little brother he knows isn't him: ""Keep it gangsta in your CD changer not your residence."" A commanding rapper who can separate the simple beats from the dull ones, he peaks when he calls in the auxiliaries. Humpty Hump and Shock G help out on a Risky Business rewrite.

Far be it from me to tear down the finest lyricist to rise up out of conscious country since Miranda Lambert, if not Bobby Pinson himself. But ""Merry Go 'Round""--which I liked, year-ended, whole thing--was epochal only by the standards of country radio, which is to say of pusillanimity itself. Already I've gotten to where I can't take the homilies of the lead ""Silver Lining,"" where I see that her label bio proudly quotes the same quatrain that made me go yuck--""If you wanna find the honey/You can't be scared of the bees [OK so far]/If you want to see the forest/You're gonna have to look past the trees [oy]."" ""Dandelion""? ""I Miss You""? Does ""pat"" mean anything to you? ""Precious""? ""Pert""? I like the trailer song and love the smoking in Vegas song and am impressed by how strong she closes, four quite distinct tracks climaxing with one in which her homilies risk a tolerance her target market could find intolerable that's topped by ""It Is What It Is,"" in which she screws a guy because no better option is currently presenting itself.

Blood Ulmer's 1977 debut Revealing reveals how articulately George Adams's saxophone answers his guitar and how drastically that guitar was to change--he's evolved from Montgomeryesque sonics toward blatant distortions and dense note clusters that take Hendrix down the road a piece. The rockish cult this sound attracted encouraged him to sing in a mumble of real but limited charm, and soon he was collaborating with David Murray on the most galvanizing live music I've ever heard him make. On this briefly domestic release as well as 1996's somewhat milder import-always Knights of Power, a horn man--Arthur Blythe on alto, Hamiet Bluiett on baritone, or (here only) Sam Rivers on soprano/tenor/flute--leaps to the fore the way Ulmer's voice ordinarily would, with the guitar chording and commenting and laying down a bed of noise more than it solos. His peak is still Odyssey, featuring one violin, no bass, and his finest all-around performance on record. But for a taste of how exciting he and Murray could be live, listen to Bluiett blow out ""The Dawn.""

That's what I call attitude, especially since even the first line is true in its unique way, and both are matters of pride. For the first time, this back-to-nature Rasta is showing some of LKJ's sophistication, and on his own terms--he doesn't inveigh against ice cream or trip over his own hapless sexism, but he declines the blandishments of reason in re technocratic conspiracy and revolutionary entertainment, and his political statement is stronger for it. ""Dis poem will not change things/dis poem need to be changed."" He insists on calling his songs poems, and he doesn't throw one of them away on the riddim. But he has started letting his words hear the music, which capitalizes on reggae's variety, from dub to jazz to anthem to the unaccompanied ""Dis Poem.""

Sired by Esquivel out of rockist techno, it's Another Fluorescent World, in which moderately intricate synthbeats drain a kitschy kitchen sink of electronic harpsichords, foghorns, string quartets, bubble machines, tintinnabulations, screams, and what can only be called natural synth noises. Anything but ambient (although hum a few bars and they'll fake it for you) and not about cool, it maintains its spritz at all times, so that even the atmospheric low points sound something like fun. I miss the illusion of a centered subject that only a singer or soloist can provide, and am not overrating schlock's use value.

Having caught up with this band a little too late to slip their debut album into my '80s book, I grabbed the chance to look back and noticed what I would have missed then: how songful it is. Pioneers in the rejection of melody just then transforming the dance music their own electronica concept runs parallel to, they're too busy rehabbing Jesus and Mary Chain to immerse forthwith in the grand and ugly atmospherics that would make Loveless a pomo classic. In other words, they haven't rejected melody yet, and on the half of the album where they manage a seamless meld they carry a tune on some of the most gut-wrenching guitar textures then yet heard, and not only that--although lyrics are irrelevant to this achievement, the ""Loved me black and blue"" of Bilinda Butcher's ""No More Sorry"" could be about what her daddy did and could be about hiding it from him, and Kevin Shields's ""Sueisfine"" definitely doesn't advise suicide and definitely does live with it.

Translations provided notwithstanding, half the songs are basically grooves, with keyboard, guitar, bass, and electric drums all manned by Brooklyn hipsters of some renown. But these grooves vary structurally--hooked by a bass drone, an insistent drum pattern, some fetching keyb. And they always move.

So I put this on out of professional responsibility (not even curiosity), and fell. Najma is a British Pakistani who popularizes an ancient Urdu lyric form called the ghazal. The words are traditional, with translations that read like abstract love poetry provided.

Sez Quest to Black Thought: ""He's never going to be the same. You just watch."" And he was right. Nas immediately transformed himself into a hit-seeking faux gangsta of depressing conventionality and didn't make another good record for eight years. That still begs the question, however, of exactly how good this spartan effort was and is. Better than I thought at the time for sure--as happens with aesthetes sometimes, the purists heard subtleties principled vulgarians like me were disinclined to enjoy, especially beatmaking where Large Professor along with such fellow New York smoothies as Pete Rock, Q-Tip, and the great Premier convert samples into haunting looped groove elements. Also enjoyable is Nas's ability to transform simple lines like ""I never sleep because sleep is the cousin of death,"" ""I'm out for presidents to represent me,"" ""The world is yours,"" and even ""One love, one love"" into de facto hooks. And my mind tells me that I have to admire how cagily he walks the line between doing the crime and hanging with homies for whom nothing else is ""real"" even if my heart isn't in it.

If this means ""Prescott Bush funded Hitler"" is ignored on the op-ed page, Nas is barred from that realm anyway, and the information certainly does his faithful more good than, for instance, the distracting fantasy that Prescott's heir planned 9/11.  The shout-outs to Bojangles Robinson, Stokely Carmichael, Redd Foxx, Fela, and Miriam Makeba are right on time. And when he and his pops get together on a blues, Muddy Waters is in the house.

I wouldn't take him at his word--especially when he says he's not going back to a street life there's no evidence he ever had knocked in the first place--and I doubt he knows as much as claimed about the perks of his Escobar hustle: ""watchin' fly bitches with grey eyes wrestle in a tub of KY,"" escaping a shoot-out with his milkshake wife, etc. The fun comes easier when he fools around with the title conceit, and even sometimes when he thinks about it. Rhyming ""orange"" with ""showin'"" and ""pawn it,"" rapping in fake Bogie, playing the ""black militant"" to his former adversary and current sponsor's ""black Republican,"" naming so many lost rappers I needed a hankie (Special Ed! Tim Dog! Fu-Schnickens! Shante!), he wants us to know he's an old-school MF who can afford efficiently state-of-the-art beats. Big worry: ""Can't sound smart 'cause you'll run away.""

Between warning Barack Obama not to say out loud what most black voters believe about fatherhood and warning Nasir Jones not to name his new album after the turned derogatory that was an African-American commonplace long before the gangsta rap Nas has been transfiguring since Illmatic, Jesse Jackson has clearly lost it. This album would have been so much more coherent if Nas could have entitled it something like, to cite a surviving song title, ""N.I.*.*.E.R,"" and included a few of the related deletions available on the Green Lantern mixtape cited below. That's because, in the classic manner of turned derogatories, the ""n.i.*.*.e.r"" songs articulate the confusion and contradiction of a ""revolutionary"" whose historical analysis encompasses Orwell, Pushkin, Farrakhan, ""The Matrix,"" the Masons, pale horseman William Cooper, Africans-discovered-America scholar Ivan van Sertima, a UFO he saw himself, ""the ghetto where old black women talk about they sugar level,"" every luxury brand known to bling and ""an elite group that runs everything""--the last of which, for the record, I half believe in myself. The beats beat Green Lantern's. And what the finale has to say about Obama is so sane I may just check out van Sertima myself.

The most political mainstream rapper and the most talented Tuff Gong scion make this a true collaboration except for one thing--beyond two Stephen Marley tracks, it's all produced or co-produced by Damian. One reason JR. Gong gets hip-hop better than his brothers is that he has the sense to subsume it in what he knows. The result is an exceptionally melodic reggae album that's intensified by rapping devoid of dancehall patois and a hard edge unknown to roots revivalism. The result is also an exceptionally political hip-hop album that's most convincing when it doesn't multiply Afrocentric distortion by Rastafarian reasoning. Go after bankers and raise the poor up, fellas. But simmer down with the ancient wisdom. The First Amendment you consider so lame or self-evident or whatever is a product of the European Enlightenment, and you are very much its beneficiaries. Back in ancient times you might be chiefs. But more likely you'd repeating some other chief's every word.

A lot of these songs don't hold up when you hang in there for every word--not because they sink into metaphor, but the fellow citizen because their points are softer than you'd hope. In neither wit nor brass does she approach Lily Allen, who figured out that an ordinary girl sticking up for herself could be a template. Nor has she grown into the intricacy of the slightly older Jens Lekman, who did the same for an ordinary guy seeking love without being a sap about it. But Nash has staying power. Whether watching ""CSI"" or distinguishing pimples from freckles or enthusiastically pronouncing the full titles she feels obliged to render as ""D---head"" and ""S--- Song,"" she remains a nice kid whose knowledge of her own limitations doesn't interfere with her self-respect. That's not just because the knowledge helps her make catchy music out of it, either. But the music helps.

I'm proud when Kitty wets her undies and Kacey screws Mr. Acceptable, but prouder, frankly, when this likable size 12 lets her voice crack all over the big fat scarewords ""feminist"" and ""sexism"" on an album that gets dissed for its simplistic songwriting as if that wasn't the point. There are a few duds, and not everything is in the mode of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre--she ends with an a cappella lament finished off with a full orchestra. A lot of it is, however, including one called ""Rap for Rejection,"" and should some jerk claim it's rejection that fuels her militance, she has the balls to leave the cad's gender unstated and write one called ""Sister"" that opens another possibility. Too bad the grungy ""Under-Estimate the Girl"" was consigned to YouTube. Check it out.

For three decades on multiple cusps, saxophonist-bandleader-actor-storyteller-educator Nathanson has shown a proclivity for song that he's regularly explored but only once indulged--on the Deborah Harry-showcasing, Elvis Costello-featuring Jazz Passengers showcase Individually Twisted two decades ago. But those were much more arranged and avant--they deliberately didn't flow. This album is relaxed; its jokes are friendlier; companionable vocalist Nathanson cedes the lead often and slips comfortably into his spoken-word shtick. ""Simon"" recapitulates Simon Says; ""Slow Boat to China"" is sillier than that; ""No Storytelling""'s composed free-jazz messing around generates a satirically overwrought recitation about narrative technique before returning to the previously scheduled program. The topper is a charmingly off-key ""I Can See Clearly Now"" by Nathanson's 18-year-old son Gabriel. I still prefer Individually Twisted in theory. But this is the one I'll play next.

I understand why the desolate love songs come first--in Matt Berninger's world, desolate love is pop fare. But what perks me up is three straight laments for middle management. ""Stuck in New York with the rain coming down,"" ""I try/Not to hurt anyone I like,"" but ""I still owe money to the money to the money I owe."" Then it's back to desolate love, only contextualized. Literary lights write novels about such stuff now, right? Why do I doubt there's one with as much emotional impact, not to mention compression? That's why we prefer music.

Matt Berninger's depressive tendencies have always been shticky--probably sincere enough, whatever that means or matters, but a stance for sale regardless. Yet as he murmurs through the quietest and most lyrical of the band's albums, I often find myself touched, moved, even sorry for him. From the stairwell tryst at the outset to the matched pledges of devotion and destruction that bring proceedings to a close, the amassed detail of the settings and feelings doesn't so much eliminate shtick as transcend it. One thing, though. Not to be a prig or a scold, but insofar as the details are autobiographical, maybe somebody should quit drinking.

Global conquest hasn't come easy, so it's a good thing N'Dour was smart enough and a smart thing he was good enough to stay in Dakar.

Not a reissue, or anyway not an '80s reissue, this comprises 1995's Senegal-only Dikkaat and 1997's Senegal-only St. Louis, which in turn comprise a dozen songs supposedly composed (and recorded?) in the '80s, although none of my sources has unearthed them all. I own two: the strictly indigenous title song of Etoile de Dakar's Thiapotholy, and a David Sancious stinker buried at the tail end of The Lion. The former reemerges cleaner, faster, and more professional, none of which are necessarily positives; I'll take the rock sonics of renegade guitarist Badou N'Diaye over Jimmy Mbaye's lithe new jack lines any day. But the latter is improved so much it's almost unrecognizable, rougher and shapelier simultaneously. Everywhere guitars, horns, and tama drums interact with sharper punch and tighter pizzazz than in his wild dance music or his crossover set pieces. And sometimes--I'd single out ""Xarit,"" ""Diambar,"" and the unabashedly beautiful ""Njaajaan Njaay""--the songwriting is even more inspired than the playing.

The synthmelt and fancy layering with which he once made nice now subject one-worlders' cosmic creature comforts to a specifically Senegalese technological elegance--and reality. The endlessly gorgeous ""Birima"" honors the elders with a melody for the ages, ""Medemba"" defends a beleaguered union boss.

The other three tracks, all well over ten minutes, are medleys designated ""Pot Pourri 1,"" ""2,"" and ""3.""

N'Dour having uploaded all the songs from this live Paris concert to YouTube, none with video and most preceded by ads, I have my physical from a friend who took the trouble--in a maneuver well beyond my own know-how--to download them and burn them sans ads onto a CD-R that runs over an hour. Sequence: ""El Fï¿½ï¿½ï¿""-""Djino""-""Mbeguï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""-""Djamil""-""New Africa""-""Africa Remembers""-""Sama Gamou""-""Serigne Modou Boussou Dieng Mbackï¿""-""Bul Nangu."" Earlier versions of four of these songs are already in my N'Dour iTunes collection, with ""Djino"" dating all the way back to the strange 1998 Best of '80s. The recent ""Mbeguï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"" is diminished here by a dexterously pro forma guitar intro; ""Serigne Modou Boussou Dieng Mbackï¿"" and ""Djami"" are intensified by female vocals from I don't know who. N'Dour is in undiminished voice as sabar drums clatter everywhere, although after all these years that voice finally has some grit to it--among other things, of course. The nearest thing in my collection is the bootleg (?) Le Grand Bal Bercy 2001 Vol. 2. This is more songful, yet so intense I've played it more than any recent N'Dour except Senegaal Rekk.

These Bay Area naysayers have made a conceptual leap--they're like Double Dee &amp; Steinski refracted through the Firesign Theatre, manipulating found (and sought) spoken-word segments over ironic musical segues and backgrounds. Each side-long satire flows and coheres, suitelike on the seven-part ""The Perfect Cut,"" motif-style on the disinformation symphony ""Helter Stupid."" Dominated by '70s audio promotions and trade ads, ""The Perfect Cut"" makes a more telling case against commercial radio than any smug media theory (or ""alternative"" programming). And ""Helter Stupid,"" the fallout from a phony press release implicating one of their songs in a teen ax murder, orchestrates a hash of socially conscious cliches--sensationalism, rock censorship, random violence, gun control, assassination, even that rotten horse the broadcast evangelist--into a funny, slightly scary, dumbfoundingly surreal demonstration of why those cliches so excite rock-culture left-liberals.

Although the musical concept-theme that pops up here and there is unnecessarily explicit, the songs more than justify it. On the woman's side of the breakup, try ""Washing the Dishes"" (soap gets in your eyes) or ""Sister's Coming Home""/""Down at the Corner Beer Joint"" (going home to mother as non-joke); on the man's, ""It's Not Supposed to Be That Way"" (but it is) and ""Pick Up the Tempo"" (on the rebound). What's more, Nelson's combination of soft-spoken off-key and battered honky-tonk matches the bare, responsive country music Jerry Wexler has gotten out of the Muscle Shoals regulars. Payoff: the two Mike Lewis string arrangements are actually climactic.

I can always do without ""Unchained Melody,"" and at times I wish he'd pick up the tempo. Basically, though, I'm real happy this record exists, not just because Nelson can be a great interpretive singer--his ""Moonlight in Vermont"" is a revelation--but because he's provided me with ten great popular songs that I've never had much emotional access to.

It's been four years since Nelson put together an album of the mournful country love songs that earned him an outlaw's independence, and even that was a concept job. These ten slow songs--maybe six special, no clinkers--were recorded thirteen years before that, apparently as demos, and the music is wonderful. Nelson's voice has never come on more fragile or deliberate--you can almost hear him figuring out what commonplace he's going to illuminate next--and his bland sounds equally sure-footed. Rarely is there a lick you haven't heard somewhere before, but the lick always seems just a leetle different, which may be because it's so exquisitely timed and may be because it's just a leetle different.

So bare-boned in language, instrumentation, and melodic contour you barely notice it at first, this turns out to be Nelson's strongest new album in over a decade, his most indelible songwriting in at least two. His latest case of love lost leaves him meeting his maker but not his mortality--if his ""life will never be the same again,"" it's not because he's gonna keel over like some 63-year-old. In fact, the pain has fired him up, so that he not only surrounds the winning ""We Don't Run"" with new standards, but plays the hell out of that acoustic guitar with the big hole in it.

Hardly new music. Nelson's stark, efficient Pamper demos, cut without fuss in 1961, briefly surfaced on Face of a Fighter at Stardust time and are the best things on Rhino's messy three-CD collectorama. Selections vary--this version omits ""Face of a Fighter"" itself, a loss. But as a songwriter he was on a roll back then, and nobody understood his singing, which means Rhino's Nite Life and RCA's Essential Willie Nelson are cluttered with off-the-rack Nashville arrangements that become a classic catalogue only in spite of their tailoring. These songs are less famous; no ""Funny How Time Slips Away"" lies in wait. But ""Healing Hands of Time,"" ""You Wouldn't Cross the Street To Say Goodbye,"" and ""I Let My Mind Wander"" will surprise the hell out of you, especially after you realize you haven't heard them a thousand times before.

It's another kiddie record gone to seed by another codger who's been around too long to believe in the end of the rainbow. Or has he? A typically ramshackle one-off cut without drums in Nelson's home studio over Christmas break, it makes too much room for daughter Amy and, for some reason, the songs of Mickey Newbury (maybe Mickey's kids could use the royalties). But what you can expect to pay for the illusion of effortlessness is the reality of effortlessness, which is that sometimes it falls on its face. Here that doesn't happen often. ""Playmate"" and ""I'm Looking Over a Four-Leaf Clover"" are born again, and where once it was agony to hear Newbury intone the half-past-dead ""not all my God-like thoughts, Lord, are defiled,"" from Nelson that's just one plain truth among many. The truth he wrote himself just last year wants us to know that heaven is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

There's only so much three prolific old coots can do with a double-CD of country standards, and they do most of it. Intimate with the literature, they pick winners you've never heard, and they're putting out, always a consideration with the prolific. Yet though the broad-beamed Price obviously needs two of the deftest singers left on the planet, it's his ruined echo chamber of a voice that injects a defining solemnity into the two religious songs, and everything else derives from that.

I only understood why I so dislike this annoyingly catchy record when I realized the name isn't an acronym. They call themselves N.E.R.D. because nerds is what they are--nerds at their worst. Sure they're clever, but they're also as shallow as Britney Spears, who I swear they're dumb enough to want to fuck, and all they know about the world is that they deserve to run it because they're clever. Ben Folds is Richard Rorty by comparison, and though I prefer their beats to Dre's beats, once again said beats fail to render the accompanying fantasies (and realities) of sexual domination palatable (or clever) (and I'm not so sure about sexual). The final blow is this American re-recording, which substitutes live instruments for the infernal machines of the U.K. version even though the studio is the only thing they've understood deeply in their short little lives. [ But for me the most gratifying surprise of this poll was the Neptunes d/b/a N.E.R.D.'s In Search of . . . , which I now love for the same reasons I panned it in July: Obscenely wealthy, obscenely catchy thugs-by-association rationalize their ethics and throw their dicks around, only they're consumed by doubt and hence honest enough to make themselves look like jerks. As conflicted as Biggie or Ghostface and more self-examined, they'll be ready for the orgiasts whenever it cools down in therre--which is not to claim the orgiasts will be ready for them.]

Produced between 1968 and 1975 by Allen Toussaint, every song here stiffed if it got released at all, yet taken together they constitute a classic singer's album as well as the ideal testament to Toussaint's spacey romanticism.

With his status as a stylist established, it's time to mention that he's too stylized. Is ""Love Letters"" ""Love Letters,"" or is it a medium-tempo falsetto-melisma standard not unlike ""Cry Me a River""? The call is too close. But nowhere in his grab bag of ad hoc albums is interchangeability less an issue than on this improved version of Charly's Make Me Strong. From jaunty stevedore plaint to dope-defeated lament, Allen Toussaint writes to the singer's experience and produces to his strengths--which you'd best believe are stronger (and more experienced) than some gravel-voiced rough boy's.

I'm glad Mavis Staples won her Grammy. She's a generous talent with a brave history. But where her civil rights-themed 2007 We'll Never Turn Back is a perfect Grammy-type record, You Are Not Alone is standard-issue Mavis with Jeff Tweedy cachet: soul as grit plus conviction. Even at that, though, I figured it to outshine a devotional album concocted by angelic-in-voice-mostly Aaron Neville and minister of good taste without portfolio Joe Henry, and I was wrong big-time. As a devout backslider, I knew nothing of Neville's previous ""spiritual"" collections, and found myself impressed by 2000's Devotion until choirs and such butted in. But here Henry's taste prevails, and it's all good: a transcendent groove record in which Neville's high-end shtick is shaped by Allen Toussaint at his subtle best and Chris Bruce doing Pop Staples's holy work. Neville never strains for effect--a Roman Catholic who thanks St. Jude in the booklet, he sounds completely at home with every Protestant word he utters. You don't have to believe in Jesus to believe in faith, not with a higher power emanating from your speakers. All that's missing is Pops himself. Anybody ready to mash up a remix?

Every once in a while an album comes up from New Orleans that captures the seemingly timeless spirit of the place as if by magic. But it's fun to figure out the tricks. The novelty of the Mardi Gras Indians made the Meters doubly infectious on The Wild Tchoupitoulas. Subtly hyped-up arrangements nudged Professor Longhair on Atlantic's live double. And here the secret isn't just the ever more exquisitely articulated harmonies of the city's definitive band, but also the unpressured live setting that instead of positing pop potential (the Capitol album) or archival integrity (the A&amp;M) presents them as the lounge-act-gone-to-heaven they are. How often does an improvisation improve a classic original like Aaron's ""Tell It Like It Is""? How many bands can get away with both ""Caravan"" and an antinuke ditty? If only they thought it was okay for women to wear pants.

FALSE,A-,Treacherous: A History of the Neville Brothers,The Neville Brothers,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2548,"
Except for Aaron, they're journeymen rather than geniuses, neither as major nor as pure as they're made out to be. Art and Cyril have never sung better than their material, often rendering it soulfully generic, and Art's keyboards were less integral to the ass-busting complexities the Meters worked on New Orleans's Latin tinge than Leo Nocentelli's guitar, George Porter's bass, or, God knows, Ziggy Modeliste's drums. This two-disc career summation is less essential than the Meters' Sophisticated Cissy, not to mention The Wild Tchoupitoulas, which it cribs from. But it does isolate four thoroughly enjoyable Art tracks (two more than you'll find on his own Mardi Gras Rock 'n' Roll), and sum up in two sides everything that's most winning about the slightly showy, uniquely unoriginal New Orleans rhythm synthesis their cult craves.

FALSE,A-,Sail Away,Randy Newman,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2876,"
Like most aesthetes, Newman is an ironist. This is fine when he's singing about human relationships, which tend to be problematic, but it's rarely sufficient morally to the big political and religious themes he favors these days. If 12 Songs was Winesburg, Ohio (or even Dubliners) transported to 1970 Los Angeles, Sail Away sometimes has the tone of Tom Lehrer transported to 1972 Haiphong, where he has no more business than Bob Hope. But never before has Newman managed to yoke his orchestral command to his piano, and I hope the leap in listenability will attract some new admirers. Also, the cosmic ironies do fit the title song, in which a slave trader becomes the first advertising man, or perhaps--this is not Tom Lehrer stuff--Melville's confidence-man, for a masterpiece even stranger and more masterful than Newman's other masterpieces.

FALSE,A-,Trouble in Paradise,Randy Newman,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2880,"
The reason 1979's Born Again took three years to sink in for me was that Newman never pinned down the distance between himself and the creeps he wrote his first-person songs about. Because he's gained control as a singer, his oafish drawl here turns into a unifying voice, and the accompaniments are as eloquently integral as the American-colloquial pastiche of his Ragtime soundtrack. So this time the baffled racist of ""Christmas in Capetown"" and the happy-go-lucky Disney hero of ""I'm Different"" and the sentimental pimp of ""Same Girl"" and the mournfully manipulative patriot of ""Song for the Dead"" and the unflappably egoistic rock star of the outrageous ""My Life Is Good"" all seem to be the same guy. And while that guy isn't Newman, Newman does go out of his way to understand his point of view.

FALSE,A-,The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 3,Randy Newman,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17106,"
Yes I enjoyed the first two volumes of this fanbase-stroking specialty item, in which Newman sits down at a piano and reprises some dozen and a half carefully wrought catalogue staples. But without his carefully wrought arrangements, they came up short on use value. Only then I stuck Vol. 3 in my CD slot on a Florida getaway and voila--this was fun, and meant to be. Why else lead with the 39-year-old novelty hit ""Short People"" and the 45-year-old Three Dog Night hit ""Mama Told Me Not to Come""? Why else pair ""Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear"" with ""Davy the Fat Boy""? True, it's not all yuks--that would be crude. This is indeed where I figured out that 1988's ""Red Bandana"" was a Bloods-and-Crips fable. It ends with 1988's bleak ""Bad News From Home"" segueing into 1971's reassuring ""I'll Be Home"" and then, on the expanded box set version, 1995's heartwarming-by-acclamation ""Feels Like Home."" But barely fun at all is what follows on the box, 2008's Iraq-steeped ""A Few Words in Defense of Our Country"" and the even grimmer capper, 2012's all too prophetic election-year sick joke ""I'm Dreaming"": ""I'm dreaming of a white president / Someone who we can understand."" You think maybe he underwent a mood shift between September of 2016, when the single CD came out, and December of 2016, when the box did? The theory's too neat. But there's an awful poetry to it.

If Tom Robinson had been young and proletarian enough to want the TRB to sound like the Clash, this oi band gone pop is how it might have come out. After three albums their gift for the anthem far exceeds, for instance, Easterhouse's, as in the anti-American ""51st State"" and the anti-'76 ""Heroes."" And though their vigilante rhetoric and doubts about terrorism have some young reds thinking fascist dupe, they're just working-class guys whose left instincts are ahead of their ideology--which I hope never shrugs off street crime or package bombs.

Obviously it's not perky enough, funky enough either, but their best (and third) album in 15 years (and probably last ever) sounds an awful lot like what kids today call pop. Electronic aura, hooks up front, Bernard Albrecht as boyish as Damon Albarn if not an actual young person, and generalized lyrics affirming a pre-9/11 reality. Give ""Crystal"" or the attempted Billy Corgan comeback ""Turn My Way"" a host of video cuties and innocents will think the mysterioso raveups are a new species of fun. Which in the better world we all deserve they'd deserve to be.

FALSE,A-,Mass Romantic,The New Pornographers,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4845,"
Even understood to indicate ""rock"" played by commercially theoretical alt-indie guitar bands, ""pop"" has become a term so elastic it assures only the desire to be tuneful or at least songful. There are wimp pop bands and punk pop bands, bedroom pop bands and studio pop bands, sour pop bands and sugary pop bands, metallic pop bands and folkish pop bands, pop bands that gleam like platinum and pop bands that mulch like autumn leaves. Even the boring ones, which doesn't just mean the tuneless ones, can claim their own ""sound."" But this Vancouver ""supergroup"" (Zumpano fans are reeling) have content, personality, and attitude (and tunes). Without powering into the radio-ready amplitude of, oh, Tsar, they have a grand old time faking artificiality: ""Telstar"" organ and ""Carrie-Anne"" falsettos, glam Briticisms and Neil Diamond chords, Katrina Leskanich tributes and faux fops tossing off lyrics like ""Heavens to Betsy/Come on let's see/What could be worse than/The wheel of history?"" All brought off with switched-on brio, sardonic multireferentiality, and jubilant momentum. Get inside that sound and it's a blast.

FALSE,A-,Brill Bruisers,The New Pornographers,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16146,"
So arch and so in-your-face about it, they remain a case study in obscurity as banality with an attitude problem. Yet the Brill Building tease of the title parses. All 13 tracks including the foreshortened ""Another Drug Deal of the Heart"" are in-your-face lessons in pop song construction, fetching verse intensified by disarming bridge powered by dynamite chorus if that's the pattern--they vary. Guitars are extraneous and electronics rule--old-school synths rather than EDM rhythms, but electronics nevertheless. So let it roll over you and find somebody else to do your meaning for you just like they're too arch to suggest in so many words. If it helps, I did find some Inspirational Verse that applies, kind of: ""They say we can't make this stuff up/But what else could we make?""

Bizwise wiseass Gregg Alexander is a postalt type we'll be seeing more of--schooled in pop values he knows as a careerist rather than an aesthete, his tough times the ones that come naturally to young entertainers on the make in a world where rebelliousness isn't necessarily faked just because it's salable. Clearest musical referents: Todd Rundgren and Hall &amp; Oates. How many boho bands have the uncool to inspire such comparisons? How many have the knowledge? How many have the chops?

Not only does she sing in a fey little voice and fingerpick a damn harp, she hangs out with the wrong crowd--hippie folkies, basically. So snub her on principle if you like, but note this quatrain (yes, quatrain): ""And the signifieds butt heads with the signifiers/and we all fall down slack-jawed to marvel at words/while across the sky sheet the impossible birds/in a steady illiterate movement homewards."" Sorry, folks, that's s-m-a-r-t whether you like its drift or not, and there's plenty more where it came from. Right, she's chronically whimsical--the final song adduces dragons. But her whimsy is genuinely funny, and though the melodies fade on the second half, which damages the poetry, there at the end of the faintest one comes the wise warning: ""Never get so attached to a poem/you forget truth that lacks lyricism."" So I won't.

The fourth Dolls album and second of their second life is the first one that's less than epochal. Not all the tunes are surefire. Its garage-rock derivative is several degrees bluesier than the permanently exploding protopunk they reprise on the closing ""Exorcism of Despair"" just in case you forgot the thrill. And the Buddhism is more overt: post-flagellant culture, existence as a temptation, ""Offering the modern crowd an absolute/Worthy of its nothingness."" Just in case you forgot the frame of reference, however, there's also a skanking remake of ""Trash."" And in the end David Johansen's lyrics somehow combine extreme skepticism, metaphysical despair, romantic agony, rock-solid agape and luv l-u-v. How should he call his lover girl? Would she settle for ""My baby, got mystical frenzy/Tempered by an irony/Verging on blasphemy""? Let's hope so.

FALSE,A-,Istanpitta,New York Ensemble for Early Music,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2564,"
Except perhaps in matters of tempo, where the most leisurely citizens of the machine age feel speed's tug in their bones, there's no way this music could sound as raw as it did back in the day. There's a class bias inherent in the survival as written texts of three saltarellos, which probably involved leaping, and 11 other even more obscure dances--whether or not they started with peasants (or Arabs), presumptive gentlefolk put their estampie on them. What's more, moderns who can play archaic bowed, plucked, strummed, blown, and beaten instruments inevitably come out of the classical world, where they are trained in the sweet, precise intonation that was standardized by the 19th-century orchestra, and director-arranger Frederick Renz is not known for rocking the boat. But frame drummer Glen Velez, who guests on three tracks, can make some noise, and courtly or not, you have to grant these tunes a decisive victory over ye olde test of time. So take this careful, lovely, not altogether unlively collection as a romance about aristocrats who ate with their hands. Anyone with a thing for Shakespearian interludes will love the shit out of it.

FALSE,A-,Dromomania,New York Gypsy All Stars,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16684,"
Maintaining a nice intensity for most of its first half and settling into a lyricism that flirts likably with cheese after that, this is the showcase Ismael Lumanovski deserves--or would be if it made room for one of the Eric Dolphy homages I heard him unfurl as a fledgling ten years ago. Tamar Pinarbasi has guitar moments on a cymbalon-looking zither called the qanum. Engin Kaan Gunaydin impresses more subtly because he has fewer holes to fill. ""Catch"" isn't the only catchy one. ""Melandia"" isn't either. Like most indigenous styles, Gypsy music risks identity when it aims to please. This is too self-assured for that.

No matter how little use you have for musical theatre--I have very little myself--this score must be the exception. Even in translation (the only way I know them) Brecht's fifty-year-old lyrics retain an ironic fervor that makes tough-minded moderns like Randy Newman or Fagen-Becker sound attenuated and cerebral, and Weill's discordant music carries its own charge. Without attempting to compare the accuracy of the Blitzstein and Manheim-Willett versions, I'd give Blitzstein's Theatre de Lys recording (on MGM) an edge over this one: of the current cast, only Raul Julia's Mack the Knife is clearly preferable to his predecessor, and Ellen Greene's egotistical ""stylizations""--in Lotte Lenya's part!--are barely tolerable. But the new sound is better, and while Manheim and Willett don't approach Blitzstein's poetry (or prosody), their sexual and political explicitness is an attraction--when's the last time you heard the verb ""to oppress"" used appropriately in a song? I'm glad to own both: you should sample at least one. Docked a notch for Ellen Greene.

Spare and delicate where most West Africans layer on the rhythms, this Harlem-based Zairean doesn't have much choice--except for two backup vocalists and a guy who chips in the occasional horns and auxiliary guitar, he plays everything himself. Ngemi's conversational tenor lifts off its falsetto whoops, his pulse is cleaner if less awesome than its homegrown counterparts, and the high, sweet minimal guitar obbligatos never let you down. Four titles, an hour of beguiling groove.

Unable to contain his pride in his wife's nursing diploma or his homeland's bus service, Ngobeni shouts roughly and excitedly at the three Kurhula Sisters, who shout boisterously and joyously right back at him, with the ""social commentary"" promised in the notes limited to the usual warnings against gossips and ne'er-do-wells. As so often with South African pop, I wonder how much good (and bad) such lyrics can do. But I have no doubts about Ngobeni's Shangaan beat, which lopes through the grass and pounds along with its nose in the dust simultaneously, and I love the way the synthesizer evokes now a mbira, now an accordion, now a Farfisa, now a Hammond B-3.

The former Fellow Traveller is so subtle it's hard to see how he'll ever crash out of the Americana ghetto--or into it, since his Wyoming-Missouri pedigree quickly gave way to postpunk New York and then London, where he once roomed with Ari Up. Maybe a Don Williams cover, if anybody this side of the Eric Clapton Fan Club remembers that hummable hubby anymore. Until then you'll have to make do with Nichols's less pushy tunes, rendered in a country-soul drawl that rarely ventures above a sleepy murmur and undergirded by a sinuous funk-reggae groove that reads incongruous and sounds ordained. He sings mostly about married love, as strung out as a week of insomnia and as pleasant as an after-dinner stroll.

Several of these five MCs having lost family members in the WTC attack, they take for their motto ""when the towers fell we rose."" Consistently political without a hint of truther nutballism, they can rhyme and they can rap. ""In the middle of the globe as the earth dies slow dies slow,"" they sound as disconsolate as they should. Claiming ""Rookie of the Year"" they cheer up, as they also should.

Finer minds than mine may find these pieces worthy of continuous attention. I say they're background music, there waiting when your mind drifts speakerward, just distracting enough to change up your mood in a useful way.

But though memorable albums have been recorded for $600, they haven't usually been memorable rock albums--electric music doesn't travel without quality controls. In any case, the trademark interactions are more emphatic on the tracks Bleach's Jack Endino didn't record, which generally means the recent ones. Not a great song band yet.

But rarely with such easy pleasure. All of the obvious pitfalls--uninspired performances, schlocky backup, arty or arbitrary programming, and of course folkie irrelevance--are avoided, and if the set is never definitive, it's an instant classic nevertheless, an intensely agreeable way into mountain music. As for the Dirt Band, Jimmy Martin was so impressed with their alertness that he offered to hire them, and I'm sorry they didn't take him up on it.

""Pirate Radio"" turns out to be a Shane-MacGowan-as-Captain-Hook chantey, ""Chicken Drop"" gets rids of his four-letter-word and junk-Americana obligations in the same song, ""I'm a Wreck"" warns against excess without moralizing, ""She's Vibrator Dependent"" is laced with a self-deprecation rare in his previous gynephobic forays. ""Burn Your Money!,"" ""Legalize It,"" and a ""This Land Is Your Land"" that features the Mojoland amusement park all voice a gonzo-leftist anarcho-populism that I trust has rubbed off on his MTV following. And the keynoting ""Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant With My Two Headed Love Child,"" written in the supermarket-tabloid style that exerts such a strong influence on Mojo's poesy, is the humane version of ""Stuffin' Martha's Muffin.""

But in the same great tradition, he and guitar-wielding Randy Randall are committed to rendering noise as music. Is that a saxophone lowing underneath ""C'mon, Stimmung""'s I'm-OK-I'm-OK? Are those electric cellos bowing behind ""An Impression""'s Monet appreciation? Is that a full orchestra plus ornithological field recordings--oh, never mind. I hope not.

So five years after the somewhat abstract An Object, this grand return to the ugly-gorgeous is true to itself as if the larger society was no more vexing than it ever was. Ditching Sub Pop for indier-than-that Drag City, they do what they've always done only better: abrade and uplift simultaneously. Drummer-vocalist Dean Spunt is an equal partner--""Send me / Where should I go?"" he repeats and repeats on the first true singalong in a catalogue more songful than you'd figure. But guitar cenobite Randy Randall owns the record. Unfurling more harmonic effects than I bet he can name, he envelops every catchy tunelet and nasty noise in overtones that'll tear you up as in make you cry and tear you up as in blow your mind. Attributing political significance or hope to this act of aesthetic commitment would misrepresent its intent. It means only to help its people thrive in whatever world proves their lot.

Concomitantly, I was disappointed rather than surprised to find that the songs about their personal world are deeper than those about our political one.

North is a Nashville session drummer whose solo music is neither bro-country nor folk-rock. This is a rock album purely--loud, obvious, devoid of punk or funk. Big drums, efficient tunes, equal helpings of keyboard and guitar, and a muscular rather than burly voice all serve what is clearly the point for a 47-year-old who's also gotten paid as an actor and standup comic: the lyrics. A solid musician, this great-nephew of Kentucky local colorist Jesse Stuart is an absolutely first-rate better songwriter. If he's any kind of feminist you'd never know it, so be glad the one where the ""damsel in shining armor"" fails to rescue the ""white knight in distress"" compensates for the ""Badgering the Witness"" charges and ""No Hard Feelings"" g'bye. And be gladder that from the acid-etched local color of ""A Good Day in Nashville"" to the DIY bile of ""Come Here Go Away,"" he serves up so much lyrical idiosyncrasy--topped for me by the nonstop ""I Sold It All,"" where I understand the meaning of every line without being sure I know what the damn thing's about.

As a white person in an integrated, how do we say it, nabe, I should breathe a sigh of relief that pithy Christopher Wallace seems content to exploit his own people--""I been robbin' motherfuckers since the slave ship,"" or, if you prefer, ""I be beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina."" As a male person, I should be grateful he doesn't want to pimp my kind either. But because I live a lot farther from the edge, these things don't make me feel better at all--I'm outraged when anyone gets robbed, beaten, or pimped, descendants of slaves especially. Hence I'm not inclined to like this motherfucker. But the more I listen the more I do. Wiping the cold out of his eyes at 5:47 a.m. or pulling his gat as the wrong guy comes down the street, he commands more details than any West Coast gangsta except carbetbagging Ice-T. His sex raps are erotic, his jokes are funny, and his music makes the thug life sound scary rather than luxuriously laid back. When he considers suicide, I not only take him at his word, I actively hope he finds another way.

This Memphis ""punk"" quartet is the rare young rock band that can pull you in on music alone. The secret is in those quotation marks, because what defines their sound is the synthesizer vocalist-guitarist-honcho Natalie Hoffman convinced her visual artist pal Alexandra Eastburn to take up. Where on their debut the result was generic grrrlpunk plus sound effect, here Eastburn bears down on the keyboard's natural sustain to imbue the accomplished enough guitarbassdrums herky-jerk with a continuity that intensifies its momentum. Part of me wishes I could understand word one of what Hoffman is going on about behind such generic titles as ""Blank Reflection,"" ""No Novelty,"" and ""Entertain Me."" But if she was smart enough to lasso Eastburn and give her her head, maybe she's also smart enough not to make herself clear until she has something new to say about her angst and ours.

Concentrating on original novelty tunes, all big requests at parties, it neutralizes their fatal cuteness by making a virtue of it, with highlights that include tributes to their manager and their sweeties, a throwaway rockabilly raver, and yuck-it-ups about hard times.

Oberg sings in an alto that doesn't actually go flat when it modulates way down as is its wont. Delivering nine expertly wrought songs in 27 minutes, she plays acoustic piano over G-B-D with jazz gestalt, zero-plus solos, and a beat more martial than swinging. The song to the God she doesn't believe in kind of rocks even so; the song about the seductive geometry of the martini glass devotes 30 seconds to chamber music. Male love objects are MIA, although she digs her bartender; three outspoken tracks praise female friends, only one of whom deserves to be as famous as she does. Figure Oberg really isn't ""so good at loving anybody up close."" But you and me are at just the right distance: ""Want to help your dead ass fly away when you've had your last breath / Want to rip a new one in the mean angel of death / Want to crush all your despair I want to make you laugh / Want to make St. Peter testify on your behalf.""

Musical cult heroes come in all gradations of quality. So Randy Newman is a genius, Chris Carrabba ain't, and Oberst falls in between in more ways than one. As is clear from 2016's Ruminations, where 10 of these 17 songs surfaced as acoustic demos, material per se isn't enough. You need support to put songs across, here organized by 74-year-old master drummer Jim Keltner (John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, you bet Randy Newman, also Russ Giguere, Henry Gross, Firefall). Attitude also matters, so good thing that by the time he cut this--after ruminating not just on Ruminations but on 2013's stillborn Upside Down Mountain--Oberst had become more upbeat, not to mention concerned about his professional future. This time ""A Little Uncanny,"" which compares Ronald Reagan unfavorably to Jane Fonda without falling for either, is nothing like a dirge, and neither is ""Rain Follows the Plow,"" which meditates on sin. Make him a gifted guy with a good heart, a handy tune sense, and a signature throb in his voice. Believe that he's not callow anymore and never will be again.

Stopping off for an idiomatic cover of New Order's ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" (wherein Braddock noticed a sikyi progression) and finishing with the '20s chestnut ""Yaa Amponsah"" (whereof Braddock tracked down an original 78), it's tuneful like all great highlife is tuneful--with Chicago saxman about town Greg Ward taking the hooky second guitar parts, maybe more. Chicago bassist Joshua Ramos is the anchor-for-hire, Kofi Cromwell sings lovely and blows his own horn, Andrew Bird contributes a violin cameo, and Asamoah Rambo is the rare African who knows his way around a trap set.

One, Nostalgia, Ultra wasn't perfect. Two, neither is this, but in a different way. There's no song here as astonishing as ""Strawberry Swing,"" ""Novacane,"" or ""American Wedding""--two of which, you will note, exploit Other People's Music (not to mention the Other Man's Music), and all of which inhabit a narrative world simultaneously richer and more ordinary than the haut-monde demimonde of most of these songs. But the musical craft on this almost sampleless album is so even-keeled that there's no song here as forgettable as ""There Will Be Tears"" or ""Dust"" either. You could speculate that when he's the sole composer Ocean resists making a show of himself--resists the dope hook, the smart tempo, the transcendent falsetto itself. And just as his music is about control, he never promotes a subject matter I believe fascinates him in a cautionary way, as the assigned fate of the r&amp;b elite. Definitely his official debut is about the demimonde, not of it. And definitely the verbal content rules. For a musical prodigy to be a writer first is a mitzvah.

Of course he's political, as in ""I'm from black America, this is just another year"" or ""You around here acting like we equal but we greater."" But what I love is his philosophical and psychological interests: conditioning as destiny, biology as destiny, how human beings acquire and apply knowledge, mental illness as a by-product of oppression, the special perils of the African-American middle class, the special burdens of the artist whose immigrant parents dreamed he would have a recognizable career. There's a love song so twisty I hope he came out on the other side. And there's also a song where he figures out ""I just want to be happy/free/left alone/me."" So I hope and half believe he did.

Four or five years late, they make selling out seem both easy! (unlike the major-label labor Ixnay on the Hombre) and fun! (unlike the fluke smash Smash). A dozen or two bpm faster than when they caught Green Day's punk wave, they sound like a Bad Religion whose catchy drone is at long last unencumbered by any message deeper than ""The truth about the world is that crime does pay""--which, to their credit, makes them indignant--or, more generally, that ""The Kids Aren't Alright."" This truth they explore as fully as--but, as is only fitting given their relatively privileged upbringing, less solemnly than--any gangsta. Only on the title track do they get grandiose. And while keeping it light keeps them on the right side of their frat-boy base, it also makes the fuckups they mock and mourn seem all the more hurtful.

Though Kevin Barnes begins lucky in love for once, he's all ""You're such a crazy girl"" as of track two, then back-and-forths until ""Famine Affair,"" Sly Stone hyperbole intended. Yet the back-and-forth evokes a real-life marital seesaw, extreme by normal standards but pretty convincing coming from a borderline hysteric, especially after the hysteric's real-life wife Nina breaks her accursed silence in her native Norwegian. The realistic aura is greatly abetted by co-producer Jon Brion, whose presence signals Barnes's felt need to put some bottom on his verbal spew and some body on his sexual fantasies. Solange Knowles's throaty cameo on ""Sex Karma"" also helps; Janelle Monae's cameo is of course spacier. And at the very end comes a sermon utilizing voice simulation software: ""When will certain people realize/that afterlife is nothing to live for/nothing to die for/nothing to fight for."" Some will surely find this preachy, yucky, or technologically compromised. I'm just happy I can say amen.

And I do admire, as he puts it, his writing. Challenging to follow even though they're seldom slurred or speeded up, his lyrics evoke without defining a humorous humanism that takes the immaturity off his subcultural jousting and erotic ups and downs--and thus firms up the stuff that preoccupies most newbies who think you could never write shit like this. Try the adoring ""Cindy OsO,"" the erotic ""let gO Of my egO,"" the overarching ""drOOl/drink that."" (All strange capitalizations in original. Pray he gets over it.)

OK, I don't approve of their album covers, although this one is relatively innocent--instead of casting the bald naked woman in molten metal they put wings on her and let her deliver a gold record, like an angel, or a carrier pigeon. But the visuals don't turn me off the aurals, which at their best fuse the body heat of funk with the mind games of the novelty single--that is, unite rhythmic and conceptual eccentricity. The not-on-any-album cuts are wasted--""Feel the Heat (Everybody Disco)"" works just well enough to prove how mistaken they were to soften their attack for a subtitle. But four or five of these tracks are unmitigated miracles of commerce, and all of them are of a piece.

This is a slight letdown, threatening to cross the line from unflappably fey to oneirically arty. But the Linda Hopper-Linda Stipe tunes allude to half-remembered melodies in much the same way the lyrical catchphrases do, and Georgia boys contribute Georgia guitar and Georgia drums.

You want full disclosure, I'll give you full disclosure: Carola Dibbell and I annotated this reissue of two long-lost early-'80s EPs for $350, below my usual word rate but it was love--I did my part in an elbow cast. Two Georgia girls, 16 and 18 when they started, tiny and childlike and minimalist and sui generis and monumental--read all about it when you plunk down your almost-a-buck-a-minute (and-worth-it) for 10 songs in 22 minutes. Our notes, however, celebrate the official oeuvre, not the 13 live bonus tracks, only one a repeat title and only another--the best, as they knew--previously released. Though a few hold up fine as is, these latter, which I first heard when I got the final, are educational, as bonus tracks tend to be. Their lesson is that the EPs, rude though they seem, comprise recordings, not songs. As songs, the previously unreleaseds would be good enough properly sung, arranged, and balanced, and they also wouldn't be on a par with ""Playtime,"" ""Person,"" or ""Such N Such."" Lynda and Linda were charming live, you can tell. But on record, it took plenty of artifice to put their naivete across. Docked a notch for conflict of interest.

Two decades later, however, this collection leaves the bullshit to Farrakhan and showcases pianist-hookmeister Huff, who along with arrangers Thom Bell and Bobby Martin outfitted the O'Jays in a shifting soul-funk-pop-disco amalgam that was most convincing when you didn't have time to think about it: ""Back Stabbers,"" ""992 Arguments,"" the indelibly bass-hooked ""For the Love of Money.""

His compulsion is to turn an absence into a presence. His clownish explosions distance him from how fucked up the violence and pleasures of his culture are and appear, respectively, and his clansmen show us how complex and full of fun their treasure is.

After a lovely opener about a couple I hope don't crash that VW Bug come two devastatingly subtle breakup songs that make me fear for Rhett Miller's personal happiness: one about tears like pearls obeying what is only natural law, one about doing the underlying rumba into the warm Caribbean sea. The band songs are only slightly less subtle. In one they rob a bank and take Route 1 north because they've got nothing but time. In the other, Miller's in more of a rush: ""I will grow impatient for your love but you will not recognize/How I might die inside unless I ride."" What does it all mean?

The punk-come-lately intensity of Rhett Miller's first three songs is so far from their silly old alt-country pigeonhole that when second songwriter Murry Hammond moseys to the mic to deliver the Marty-Robbins-come-even-later ""You Were Born to Be in Battle"" they could be a separate-and-unequal band. After that, however, Miller pipes down without giving up. He credits ""Champaign, Illinois"" to Bob Dylan for the excellent reason that it (thoroughly) rewrites ""Desolation Row,"" and if Uncle Bob really wants to shake things up some night he should master the lyric, which at this point in history is more apropos than the original. Soon Hammond's ""You Smoke Too Much"" is fitting right in. As together as can be expected, and as Miller requests with a hint of desperation, ""Please Hold On While the Train Is Moving.""

Renowned for the care and skill with which it digitalizes pre-owned, pre-electric, one-mike shellac, this two-CD, 37-track package is worth the time of anyone with a fan's interest in the ongoing Africanization of American pop. The audio is clearer and warmer than on any Oliver I've heard, acoustic or electric, and the repertoire packs plenty of musical charge as well as historical charm, both of which it needs. Not for nothing do David Sager's excellent notes include phraseology like ""upon careful listening,"" ""interesting to notice,"" ""contain evidence of,"" and ""a kind of text,"" because this package is intended for study as well as pleasure. That's fine--the first recordings of both a seminal bandleader starting his decline, King Oliver, and a young man about to change the world, Louis Armstrong, are worth studying. But nobody makes 37 records in a year without substantial fluctuations in quality, and the style here, in which traditional New Orleans ensemble playing is yielding to Armstrong's hyperactive virtuosity, does sound quaint to any but committed jazz buffs. Oliver is more prominent than Armstrong, but most prefer it when the kid comes forward (dig the slide whistle on ""Sobbin' Blues""). Over many listens, I was struck by how some tunes never connected--three stabs at the promisingly entitled ""Workingman Blues,"" for instance--while ""Mabel's Dream"" and the Thomas Dorsey-cowritten ""Riverside Blues"" always did. In chronological order, my picks, which forgive sloppiness, enjoy hokum, and include two also on Armstrong's fast-disappearing Portrait of the Artist box (I agree with Sager that the hot parts of ""Tears"" don't make a whole): ""Just Gone,"" ""Chimes Blues,"" ""Weather Bird Rag,"" both ""Dipper Mouth Blues,"" ""Froggie Moore,"" the second ""Snake Rag,"" ""Sweet Lovin' Man,"" ""Sobbin' Blues,"" ""Alligator Hop,"" ""Krooked Blues,"" ""London (Cafe) Blues,"" ""New Orleans Stomp,"" ""Buddy's Habit,"" ""I Ain't Gonna Tell Nobody,"" the first ""Riverside Blues,"" and the second ""Mabel's Dream.""

He's a university graduate whose compositions were being picked up while he was still a student, and you could say he sounds like one--singing with more brain than body, he deploys his breathy baritone for subtlety and leaves the heavy lifting to the hired hands. But what he really sings like is a songwriter, specifically a ballad specialist who cares about sound play and emotional complexity. I have no way of judging how responsibly he's programmed this inexpensive double-CD from his several dozen albums except to report that it includes early and late titles of some renown. I can say that the slower disc is more beautiful than the Olomide Stern's put out in 1990, and that the special remix CD makes room for the animateur-driven seben beats he claims he's too deep for.

Duty dictates that I detail my discographical cavils, to wit: the original versions of six of the eight songs remixed here (one of them in two permutations) were all on Hearsay, the better of the two albums (oops, three: forgot the Xmas collection) he's managed since 1985. Four (five counting the extra permutation) are on side one--everything but ""Hearsay"" itself. So if like me you own Hearsay, if like me you convinced yourself to enjoy the ballads, you lose: the usual arguments for concision just don't wash here. Maybe these remixes are no better than the originals, but they're also no worse: at seven minutes or so apiece, nothing wears.

Daniel Lopatin may be a deconstructionist, but he's no ascetic. Unlike too many post-rockers, he has a taste for content as well as form and for creation as well as contrarianism, harvesting a healthy plateful of diverse sounds and textured note sequences from his beloved analog keyboards and then arraying them in songlike tracks that stay in the four-minute range until the quietly celebratory seven-minute finale. Chugging, grinding, crackling, swelling, bubbling, babbling, these tracks don't sound like part of the natural world, but they certainly sound cognizant of the natural world.

With R Plus Seven's Hammond B-3 vibe out of his system, Daniel Lopatin assembles something resembling an emotionally complex reflection on suffering humanity. Purportedly a concept album about a hypergrunge band called Kaoss Edge--no, there is no such thing as ""hypergrunge"" (so far), but that doesn't stop Kaoss Edge from having a website--it's as coherent as Lopatin wants it to be. Read along with the hyperautotune lyrics of ""Sticky Drama"" and hear an alt-teen pencil-dick love song transmute into an alt-contrarian death-metal horrorshow; read along with the cute-sounding electro-munchkin lyrics of ""Animals"" and learn they're about cages and worse. But the music is more playful and frankly interesting than these dark themes suggest--and also more multifacted, virtuosic, and urban than Lopatin's excellent stealth-pastoral Replica. I credit this healthy paradox to the guy's irrepressible sonic imagination. His mind may believe the earth is one big disaster area. But even so he remains a clever, funny dude who enjoys his musique concrete collages too much to set his sights on distant galaxies.

But except for ""The Whole of the Law"" (available on Epic's now-digitalized Special View), this hits the high spots. Because they always played better than the classic pop band they never really were, Peel's demand that bands lay down four songs in a day of recording--half-live, as it were--gets the part of their groove that studio polish glossed over.

Recorded in the six months preceding Ono's 80th birthday and released seven months after it, this is a quantum livelier and more assured than Between My Head and the Sky, Ono's 2009 album with her and Sean's revival of her and John's band/concept. In fact, it outstrips 1981's Season of Glass and 1995's Rising, surely her two standouts from a pop perspective. In other words, this justly renowned avant-pop figurehead not only made a good album as she looked 80 in the face, she made her best album, separated from her previous peak by 18 years, which was separated in turn from its previous peak by 14 years. That's what I call a life. Crucially, failed frontman Sean mirrors the boss's artistic appetite and force of personality by overseeing a studio-rock that's as eclectic as it is unified. There are clubby beats and avant-noise and straight rock guitar; there's a song that starts with little bells and a song that anchors his mom's ululations to bassy avant-funk. Of course she preaches peace and bemoans her desolation and tells us to dream. But my two faves are both quite funny for an artist some stupidly pigeonhole as pretentious: ""Bad Dancer"" and ""Leaving Tim."" Both are about what they say they're about, and delighted as I am that a Fluxus grad who's been known to flirt with EDM should giggle about breaking a leg, I'm even more delighted to hear an old woman break off snippily and light-heartedly from her latest boyfriend.

Finally history leaves Yoko free to find the music her life has taught her to make. Neither primitivist/minimalist retro nor a final awkward attempt to improve on Season of Glass, this brims with the calm confidence of an semidetached bystander now hailed as a direct influence by all manner of rock bohemians, including some too snobbish to understand that, actually, her late husband was the stone genius in the partnership. Its precondition is the avant-garde's new pop panache. In the world before Nirvana, I doubt any major would have bankrolled the 14-minute title track's virtuoso vocalese, or the shrieks that fill a six-minute number of identical title and lyric: ""I'm Dying."" What '80s bizzer would have been down with her arch, lovely animal imitations, or the starkly literal ""Turned the Corner,"" or the plainly simple ""New York Woman,"" or the platitudinous ""Revelations""? But these days Courtney could cover ""Talking to the Universe"" and no one would blink.

Olivia Stone sings nine of this L.A. trio's fetching tunes with a plaintive modesty that's just fetching enough. The standout lyric concerns a dead goldfish, but most stick to Stone's normally troubled love life. Alt-retro without being polemical about it, the tunes themselves are enough to prove she cares about relating, in part because they prove she's not trying to look cool. But that trick only goes so far. When one of the guys sings the other three he's just a whiner.

Vocal strongman Warrior Opara and guitar heavy Dan Satch Opara carried the burden of Heavy on the Highlife!, John Storm Roberts's 1991 introduction to the Oriental Brothers, who are more a brand name than a verifiable cohort of musicians. Although third brother Kabaka was the first to break away from the original group, his gift would appear to be mediation--between the band's Ibo loyalties and its continental ambitions, its quiet youth and its jamming maturity. These five lively six-to-17-minute tracks are so sweetly indefatigable that their duration defines them--not polite enough for highlife, they seem almost like juju with a steadier pulse, or soukous with a less flamboyant bottom. Kabaka's guitar invokes both alien styles.

They've been my Afropop primer of choice in Puerto Rico for a decade, and this 1982 swan song is regarded as the best of their four estimable albums. It was never officially released here till now, and I used to find it too casual. But as the even more relaxed previously unreleased disc makes clear, getting in the mood is good for your blood supply. Baobab's taste in salsa was charanga in aura if not form, there's no Iberian schmaltz in their singers rough or smooth, and their horn section consists entirely of Issa Cissoko, a drolly doleful individualist whose tenor provided a foil for Barthelemy Attisso's bilingual guitar.

Specialist in All Styles and Made in Dakar, the 2001 and 2008 albums that reunited this world-class band, climaxed a career that began with a 15-year run in 1970, went into abeyance rather than ""modernize,"" and then surged back. But because guitarist-arranger Barthelemy Attisso would rather be a lawyer in Togo than a star in Senegal, this long-delayed sequel was a challenge. Attisso's young Beninois replacement is deft enough without approaching his calm mastery or getting as much room, overshadowed as he is by a well-integrated kora add-on who, while hardly the usual mystagogue, sometimes renders the ambience perilously world-musicky even so. But though singer Ndiouga Dieng is indeed gone, Balla Sidibe and Rudy Gomis remain frontmen to reckon with as their voices roughen, and where Baobab's other 21st-century albums reconstituted their greatest hits, here they generate new titles worthy of their legend. For orientation, start in the middle with ""Woulinewa"" and the only remake, the Dieng-identified ""Sey,"" which a cameo from Baobab alum Thione Seck takes home. Then start again from the beginning.

Nine cuts lasting 70 minutes recorded on one day of a 1994 U.S. tour, it shambles more than Original Music's Oriental Brothers CDs; the band is so well rehearsed it makes relaxation a creative principle, interacting casually over the clattering percussion and never-ending vamps of a genre that intimates juju drums and soukous guitar within the Ghanaian dance style that defined Afropop when Osadebe was a teenager. Known for his store of traditional guitar tunes, he likes the horns to poke their noses in as well. I hope some fan constructs a compilation from his 200 albums.

Tim Darcy fuses the detachment of a lecturer with the morality of a prophet, and the constriction and unresolved tension of the music justifies his white-boy mindset better than straight punk would.

The blackstrap flow of their live slow jams ends up an evolved G-funk with denser instrumental crosstalk, no less street for putting organ rumble or soundtrack keyb where the eerie tweedie used to be. But even so the music's Southernness signifies as rural, evoking Booker T., endless Gregg Allman ballads, humid afternoons with horseflies droning over the hog wallow.

Like Milton Nascimento and Astor Piazzolla, Palmieri enjoys a prestige based on his pretensions as well as his talent. Check 1974's pivotal The Sun of Latin Music and notice how many bases it touches. To list the obvious, there's a full-fledged suite; pianistics that recall Monk, Tyner, even Cecil Taylor; a snatch of Abbey Road; a conga workout; a salsa tour; a simple cumbia arted up with a bass-and-piano break; and--crucially--enough cheese. Times having changed, this equally far-reaching album seems less epochal (and is definitely less cheesy). But I insist that its intrinsic musicality equals if not exceeds that of The Sun of Latin Music, and suspect that it's one of Palmieri's best. The impressionistic ""Tema para Renï¿½"" is an art move; so is the graceful and audacious ""Gigue (Bach Goes Batï¿½ï"" But in general the old man nails the good old three-and-two through a panoply of variations.

Rajinder Rai knows there are more hooks and vocal flavors where ""Mundian To Bach Ke"" came from, and if none of them spells follow-up in God Bless Xenophobia, they'll keep interested parties going.

Named after a 50-year-old work of political analysis by ironic left-liberal historian Richard Hofstadter and led by Elizabeth Nelson and Timothy Bracy, a pushing-40 D.C. couple who've worked as lobbyists and written their share of quality rock criticism, the Paranoid Style mine a pop-rock vein that braces Wilson's cleanly uncrystalline articulation against Bracy's noisier guitar and a straight four that doesn't quit. With scarcely a word swallowed or a turn of phrase obscure, their disturbing ditties delineate a worldview Nelson has said is ""rooted in the small-c conservative conviction that Man is neither perfect nor perfectible--and don't get us started on Woman."" The mix should be crisper because the tunes demand nothing less. But for lyrics like ""Do it with a flick of wrist/Like you're a magician/Oh you're such a solipsist/There's only one position"" and ""I'm your friend and I'm your lover/Give me those clogs I'll be your mother,"" you'll settle.

So say for purposes of argument that Elizabeth Nelson always needs to get a little blotto, because otherwise she sees more than she can bear. And say too that she needs to rev that blotto up. Her aversion to nonsense isn't merely acerbic--calm and well-spoken though she remains, she can still run you over with her full-on bitterness.

""We tried to figure out exactly the point of show business during this most lurid of all impasses,"" Elizabeth Nelson noted recently, and whether avocational indie counts as show business or not, it's clearly been a trial. The title tune is properly scary: ""It's like the founders said the jaws of power are always open to devour,"" soon followed by ""You dined on us so long you lost the taste for delicacy."" But ""I Believe U Believe U Can Fly"" is the one great song on this EP because it torpedoes a catchphrase we figured out long ago. Other zingers of varying quality are dropped here and there--the throwaway ""Langford's still an atheist"" is one I like. But the lyrics tend opaque--pretty sure ""Hawk Vs. Prez"" is about Lester Young, for instance, but that took a lot of delving that only got me so far. What makes this lacuna doubly frustrating is that Nelson probably knows more about the ins and outs of Washington politics than any songwriter working, and it would be nice to think she could make something of what may not actually be an impasse. It would also be nice if she roped in a more limber rhythm section.

FALSE,A-,Guitarra Portugesa,Carlos Paredes,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5803,"
When an alien style hits you where you live, learning to say hello is easy. When it doesn't, some genius has to make the introductions--like this third-generation master of a guitar that looks like an oversized mandolin and sounds like a small orchestra. At the most obvious level Paredes's florid runs and melancholy melodies are generically Iberian, but listen deeper and the romanticism of these 20-year-old sessions turns defiantly modern and irreducibly local. Popular classicism, ancient to the future.

The Bush killa switched from rapper to stockbroker circa Y2K, made a modest fortune, then returned to music self-financed and angrier than ever. America? ""We lead the world in only three categories-number of characters locked up, number of grown folks who believe angels are real, and defense spending."" Obama? ""They hate 'cause he black. We hate 'cause he wrong."" And those are mere cappers. Like Boots Riley, Paris rhymes over the kind of old-fashioned funk favored in the East Bay from Too Short to Lyrics Born, inveighing knowledgeably for an hour and a half against the capitalism he knows so well as he drops his own brand of street science-try ""Side Effect,"" about thugging without health insurance, ""Murder Suit,"" about funeral wear, ""Truce Music,"" about ending hostilities best redirected, ""Bring That Slap Back,"" about armed self-defense. Of course I don't ""agree"" with everything he says. Do I ""agree"" with Lil Wayne? Anyway, usually I do.

FALSE,A-,Tally All the Things That You Broke,Parkay Quarts,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16188,"
Maybe some classify our finest current punk band as garage because they're the first punk band anyone can recall that's also significantly a groove band--in the ""Whippin' Post"" rather than ""Super Bad"" sense, natch. Tuneful-toothache opener aside, the standouts on this unnecessarily unheralded EP are certainly the five-minute ""The More It Works,"" where I'm just going to assume ""it"" refers to his penis, and the seven-and-a-half-minute ""He's Seeing Paths,"" where they bring out the cowbell like the damn Chambers Brothers as they follow a bicycle rider around the five boroughs. (Well, maybe the Fall.)

The deal seems to be that the latest garage-punk heroes spell their name like the fancy flooring when they put in time on the long-player and the lower-priced spread when they don't. And though I've liked them all so far, I've preferred the quickies. This one includes songs about insomnia, catastrophe, and a shrink I'm glad they can afford, Roky Erikson and Nancy Sinatra covers, and no bitching about romantic dysfunction. The best lyric forswears social media, the worst waxes Dylanesque. Strong from the start, it takes off midway through with the ear-catching ""Pretty Machines."" All in all: the world looks kind of like hell, and punk won't save you from it, but meanwhile . . .

This is indeed a disappointment. The production is muddy, the female chorus an excrescence, and ""The Heat in Harlem"" vapid and overblown. But it's not as depressing as the faithful believe. Sure, I'll probably put on Howlin Wind or Heat Treatment when I feel like hearing Parker--unless I just have to hear one of these songs, most of which eventually implanted themselves in my subconscious just like the others.

FALSE,A-,Belief,Leon Parker,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2040,"
A jazz record, indisputably--an acoustic jazz record. But Parker's commitment to minimal means, catchy tunes, up-front beats, and internationalist percussion suits the soundscape mindset--if anything, ambient wonks may find his structures too clear, his melodies too direct. Moreover, his second album accomplishes these elusive goals so fully that seekers will be compelled to interface with the music as well as the ideas. Which is one idea that's almost always a keeper.

FALSE,A-,The Other Woman,Ray Parker Jr.,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2902,"
Blessed with a one-track mind in a twenty-four-track world, he provides all the basic vocal and instrumental parts on an unannounced concept album about ""romance,"" i.e., sex with all the fixings. Sometimes he's merely raunchy--""The Other Woman"" and ""Streetlove"" are male and female versions of sex-for-its-own-sweet-obsessive-sake, and in ""Let's Get Off"" they come together. But at other times he gets serious, which is to say raunchy and romantic, upping the ante with leave-him-for-me speeches and patient propositions (""anyplace you like"" refers to body parts, not apartments). Even when he proposes marriage it's only because the lady's stuff is so good he wants his name on it. Couldn't say how many positions he knows--in ""It's Our Own Affair,"" he swears his partner to secrecy. But I'm sure he's got them all written down for the follow-up.

FALSE,A-,Greatest Hits,Ray Parker Jr.,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2901,"
Parker is that ever rarer prize, an inspired journeyman. His music is eloquently unobtrusive, and while he doesn't talk his songs, he has no need for vocal pyrotechnics he couldn't muster--his stylishly textured conversational timbre, halfway between a murmur and a purr when he's turning it on, is a cunning interpretive device. In a subgenre whose practitioners hone their sexual personas as sharp as Cole Porter rhyme schemes, he can't be said to have come up with something new--the secure, sincere superstud is a role Teddy Pendergrass exploited less cleverly for years. So this collection is just the thing for those benighted who can't believe they need more than one piece of long-playing ass-man jive. Well, actually they don't--necessity has nothing to do with it.

FALSE,A-,Up for the Down Stroke,Parliament,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2666,"
What seems to distinguish this mysterious alternate version of Funkadelic (same personnel, different label) from the original is that it's more politic. Its excesses don't offend. Gone is all the scabrous talk of holes and bitches, and gone too are the politics themselves--the nearest this comes to social criticism is to praise the brain. But what's left is damn near a (musical) revolution. The material George Clinton has amassed over the years--the harmony-group vocal chops, the Jimi H. guitar, the James B. horns and rhythms--is here deployed in yet another audacious deconstruction/reconstruction of black pop traditions, and this time it works. All of the voice arrangements skew the original ""I Wanna Testify"" (which is reinterpreted for comparison) the way those of Big Star do, say, ""Run for Your Life."" The horns and guitars weave and comment and come front. And the title cut kicks and jams. One more riff like that and they'd take over the world.

That DJ from Chocolate City, or maybe it's the Chocolate Milky Way, keeps the beat going with nothing but his rap, some weird keyboard, and cymbals for stretches of side one. And later produces the galactic ""Give Up the Funk"" and a James Brown tribute that goes ""gogga googa, gogga googa""--only believe me, that doesn't capture it.

The hook on these 14 two-minute songs isn't tunes except occasionally. It's whichever of the two guys who ""sing, if you must call it that"" comes packing the most anxiety--that is, the one who kicks off ""Donuts Only"" by whining ""Like a red state's Baptist fervor/Like a small town's unsolved murder"" like his meds are not quite perfect. Texan refugees whose idea of a vacation is North Dakota, they're stoned and starving in Ridgewood, Queens, where they ended up after concluding that ""There are no more summer lifeguard jobs/There are no more art museums to guard."" So they're pretty much resigned to giving this drone-rock thing a shot.

Or maybe they are a garage band--one with dreams. Certainly Andrew Savage has succeeded at composing songs with distinct hooks at differing lengths and tempos and constructing an album that reveals more goodies the more you play it. I've stopped wondering about the real-world coordinates of the mamacita whose offer of refuge suffuses the unforgettable seven-minute slow one that gets special play on the back cover, and the title cut is just too fast to be about a cat. But two different songs dis two different women without making Savage sound like a dick. And ""Black and White"" gets the frenzied compulsion to run out of your skin just right. (Not tight enough for the Buzzcocks.)

Beginning with two absolutely classic songs, one about a mother's love and the next about a mother's sexuality, and including country music's answers to ""Triad"" (""If I Lose My Mind"") and ""The Celebration of the Lizard"" (""The Mystery of the Mystery""), side one is genius of a purity you never encounter in rock anymore. Overdisc is mere talent, except ""She Never Met a Man (She Didn't Like),"" which is more.

Three Minneapolis malcontents despair messily and catchily about the Balkans, the Holocaust, crime for crime's sake, and everything else that robbed them of their youth. Their guitar-bass-drums is punk only by historical association--incompetents or not, they have bigger (OK, looser) ideas about tempo, rhythm, and form. But like so many lo-fi note-missers of enduring social value, they're winningly enthusiastic about their own negativity. As their Iraqi spokesman puts it: ""We got desert and we got sand/We got acres of useless land/We got something that you ain't got/We got rage and we got a lot.""

Although Revenant's seven-disc Patton box remains reissuedom's preeminent fetish object, its completism, including its massive documentation, turns the principled crowd-pleaser into a confusing combination of obscure great artist and pro who led the Delta in studio time. The JSP label is selling all the Patton titles on Revenant's first five CDs, in reportedly superior audio, for a fraction of Revenant's price, but you can live with a single disc like this improvement on Yazoo's Founder of the Delta Blues. The sound is no harsher or dimmer than Revenant's, and the seven new selections emphasize tune, humanizing Patton's raw power--he's a formal wellspring, but also an independent songster with a lot of ideas. Docked a notch for cutting ""High Water Everywhere"" off at the knees.

These San Franciscans really don't like CDs--where a rap sample scratches a little, their pissed-off speedtoons jangle through the cracked pickup of an old GE portable. Though this mannerism is irritating at first, the toons themselves are so punky (and toonful) that it endears in the end. What ever happened to Camper Van Beethoven? ""Box Elder.""

The rumor that the title means ""watered-down, not wild"" would bewilder music-lovers outside Indieland. Though it does comprise four distinguishable, hummable songs, it isn't anything the big guys would call pop music, just a dandy outro for Drag City's EP compilation. And since nobody this good lives in Indieland forever, it raises the question of what they'll do for an encore. As they brag, admit, or observe, they've got ""so much style that it's wasted."" Which means the content problem is staring down their throats.

This concept CD about the limits of vinyl fetishism--23 cuts off EPs, flexidiscs, and other ephemera you may have read about or even purchased--is the ideal way to hear rather than collect their song-noise, which starts out as pissed-off speedtoons crackling through the pickup of an old GE portable and gradually gets (somewhat) bigger. Even irritating instrumental doodads like ""Krell Vid-User"" gain presence (aka ""warmth"") in digital form, and besides, if you get too irritated you can zap 'em. Pretend this is all that remains of a great art-punk band that never wert and chances are you won't want to.

Two of the others are also linear in groove and structure, sparely dissonant tunelets you'll love when they get broken out live.

Since I was fooled myself until I saw them live and knew every riff, I'm wondering why some believe there are no songs here. Probably the explanation is tempo. There's never that frantic hang-on-for-your-life moment when you either pay attention or embrace brain death--when you engage at gunpoint. And though the music seems stitched together rather than wound tight, it's never in any apparent danger of falling apart; it isn't riven or driven by internal contradictions. Thus, too much meaning is left up to the words. But that's not the same as the songs not being there--or as the meanings not being there either.

Outlaws are hardly immune to palaver, of course. But the best-of format eliminates the posturing to which this well-named entertainer resorts when the songs get thin, while his current Waylonism limits him to one pretty good romantic ballad. Almost every other selection talks funny and sings tough--in my favorites, a drunk who picks on a Mexican has his ear surgically removed and John resigns from the I.R.S.

Stoner alt-rap from Wesleyan and Das Racist graduate Kool A.D., who in late November also posted O.K., a 100-track pay-what-you-want Bandcamp mixtape I wish he'd fucking ""curate"" and haven't found time for, although for research's sake I enjoyed the seven-minute ""Alice Coltrane"" OK. With affable sidekick Kassa Overall making it a duo, this August release is somewhat more . . . can I say finished? Nah. Passage taken half at random over an undeveloped loop from the by no means focus track (whatever that would mean with these jokers) ""Hot Negro Pause"": ""Shit that/Huh/It's that shit that/It's that shit that/Make you slip all of the clips out the guns though/Sippin on a Cris but not the racist champagne the Cuban beer/So y'all can know it's a real Cuban here/Happy Nubian New Year."" And it goes on, affably and much more than passably. I've never been much of a pothead. But Victor Vazquez's goofily utopian, politically hip benevolence makes more of weed than Jerry Rubin or Dr. Chronic ever did. He's an escape and a comfort, and I wish him enough money to live on. Curated Verse: ""Plus green energy/Clean green energy/No frackin' or dependence on foreign oil/Uh tamales in corn husks no foil/Uh cut the billions allotted to military spending and put that shit into education/But save me one spaceship just in case man.""

Eddie Vedde's struggles with stardom have a concreteness missing from more mythic epics of resistance. But it isn't his MTV boycott or TicketMaster stand that make his third album his best--it's his need to live up to Kurt's musical example and expiate Kurt's mythic pain. Three or four of these songs are faster and riffier than anything else in P. Jam's book, token experiments like ""Bugs"" are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony his sincerity is something like a relief--a Kurtlike relief at that.

FALSE,A-,Yield,Pearl Jam,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2713,"
The reality they come to terms with here is musical, and I'm impressed they had it in them. From the electronically foreshortened riff that announces their need for attention to ""Push Me, Pull Me"" studio manipulations that signal their refusal to be pigeonholed, the nice techy edge of Brendan O'Brien's production can't conceal their aesthetic conservatism or materially enhance songwriting and performance skills they've never pitched higher. Like nobody less than Nirvana (right, they're dumber, thank you for sharing), they voice the arena-rock agon more vulnerably and articulately than any Englishman standing. Rarely if ever has a Jesus complex seemed so modest.

Suggesting what we already knew: that good soul music is more a matter of faith than of fashion. Wilson Pickett may have lost his, but this twenty-three-year-old is just beginning to testify. Her background is gospel and her dynamic blues, the perfect combination, and even when the songs aren't first-rate, which they usually are, her lean, slightly burred timbre meshes with the incredibly spirited Memphis music (Memphis is where even session men believe) to intensify their meaning. Among my faves: ""Give Me Some Credit"" (downhome girl-group) and ""It's Your Thing"" (it's hers, bro). I just wish there were a dozen songs instead of ten. Time: 26:59.

Why gritty singing like this can't be heard on ""progressive"" radio when a borderline hysteric like Lydia Pense is an automatic add ought to be investigated by the Civil Rights Commission. ""I Feel Like Breaking Up Somebody's Home Tonight"" is pre-ideological female rage, and the woman shows her sense of roots and prerogatives by coming up with competitive covers on both Bobby Bland and Sam &amp; Dave.

Certain black bohemians--Richie Havens is the perfect example--have developed a style of humanitarianism unspecific enough to make ""War"" and ""Ball of Confusion"" sound like Frantz Fanon. Pena's outlook is similar, but between his rolling virtuoso guitar and his abiding vocal soulfulness (the man leaves mere conviction back with Norman Vincent Peale) he moves me. Even the naivete of the lyrics makes for home truths unavailable from more sophisticated writers.

With the Futures doing backup and Stephanie Mills doing duet and Ashford &amp; Simpson doing their number and Cecil Womack doing himself proud, this may well be the definitive Teddy. Only once does he break into a fast tempo, which is fine with me, because schmaltz is the man's meat. He needs, he demands, he comes on hard, he comes on subtle, he goodtimes, he longtimes--in short, he inspires heavy petting, and we all know what that can lead to.

Heard in retrospect, Teddy's solo ascendancy seems a quantum more relaxed than his indenture with Harold Melvin--the aural equivalent of Tom Selleck, though Teddy isn't quite so coy about how much pussy he gets. It also seems more seminal than I would have figured, the inspiration for midtempo come-ons by everybody from Jeffrey Osborne and Al Jarreau to the creaky old O'Jays and Isleys. Teddy even induces a normal guy like me to enjoy this deplorable trend. Slick-talking greaseballs like Eddie Levert and Ronnie Isley are a social menace, but hunks like Teddy are just wonders of nature. And thank God there aren't too many of them.

I admit his subtle command of his big gruff tentpole of a voice was soul-schooled. Coming up when he did, that was only to be expected, and Pendergrass was not one to defy expectations--musically and thematically, he had all the imagination of a rubber penis. Seduction was his one great subject, and though he did it as well as it's ever been done, his sense of sin was so vestigial that even after God disabled him in a car accident he never once feinted toward the pulpit, as any proper soul man would have. In short, he's the great lost link between Lou Rawls and Keith Sweat--and a truly awesome bullshitter.

Not since Another Green World has ambient music sounded this rich. The big difference is that the instruments are mostly acoustic--Simon Jeffes does count electronic organ and ring modulator among his fourteen, but he runs more toward ukelele and pennywhistle, and the ensemble includes violin, cello, and oboe.

On their 2005 debut, quick, clear, literate, Boston-based, Bajan-American rappers Mr. Lif and Akrobatik sounded more musical trading timbres as a duo than holding forth on their worthy solo albums--little guy Lif clipped and cool and pitched deeper, Akrobatik the good-natured jock. A dozen years later, as 42-year-olds who've each survived a brush with non-gangsta death--Akrobatik from an aortic aneurysm, Mr. Lif in a tour bus gone over a cliff--they lead their belated follow-up with three tracks that drop more political science than any TrumpTime hip-hop to date: Big Pharma and body armor, tax laws and proportional representation, racial solidarity and cross-racial solidarity, ""treason"" in a ""world out of control."" Given that Lif was criticizing Obama's monetary policies in 2009, this is no surprise. But it's certainly satisfying. Not everything that follows is so right on. But in a kind of compensation, ""When Push Comes to Shove"" radiates more love than ""4:44.""

Ubu's music is nowhere near as willful as it sounds at first. Riffs emerge from the cacophony, David Thomas's shrieking suits the heterodox passion of the lyrics, and the synthesizer noise begins to cohere after a while. So even though there's too much Radio Ethiopia and not enough Redondo Beach, I'll be listening through the failed stuff--the highs are worth it, and the failed stuff ain't bad.

Recitative, animal noises, and industrial waste for the ear threaten their precarious (by definition) art-rock balance. ""A Small Dark Cloud"" is mostly voice and sound effects, ""The Voice of the Sand"" mostly whisper and sound effects, ""All the Dogs Are Barking"" barely more. Then again ""Jehovah's Kingdom Comes!"" rocks, and ""Goodbye"" is as quietly hypnotic as it's supposed to be. When David Thomas starts off crowing ""It's me again!"" he's not really boasting--he's hitting us with the very best he has to offer.

Side one is the long unavailable Datapanik in the Year Zero EP, itself comprising two indie singles and a compilation cut and as powerful a sequence as side one of Dub Housing nevertheless. Side two collects the kind of oddments that rarely cohere on LP, yet here the outtakes and B sides and stray singles come together as a record of David Thomas's slide or progress from willed optimism to blessed whimsy. In short, this is a gift from God--a third Ubu album from the former Crocus Behemoth's pre-God period.

""We'd never been asked to write a pop record before,"" David Thomas says. ""I guess it never occurred to anyone."" Thomas was happy to oblige. No private visions of decaying cityscape, just equally obscure (and evocative) love songs, down on their knees to rhyme with please. Produced mostly out of Ubu's old Ohio home, then smoothed down and hooked up in London, their signature avant-garage survives with its stop-and-go effects and unsalable recitative in fine fettle. If you're a fan, the six Stephen Hague-produced or Daniel Miller-remixed cuts will sound misbegotten at first. But if you're really a fan, you'll come to recognize them as the urban pastoral of Thomas's whimsical period adapted for the cheap seats, which deserve the attention.

Something has happened to David Thomas since this ""special acoustic evening"" in 1991, and though I'm tempted to call it art, it's probably just the art world. Thomas has always fiddled with art-rock, but only when he hit the museum circuit in the '90s did his respectable side get the better of him. It's impossible to imagine him endangering an ICA performance piece with ""mind-dead rock"" like ""Non-Alignment Pact"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog""--for one thing, no attendee would think of requesting such a thing. And it's all too difficult to imagine him rocking a 1999 ""acoustic evening"" with such benign aggression and hang-loose cheer. ""Enough fun,"" he announces grumpily as he cuts Iggy off at 40 seconds--leaving us to discover that ""We Have the Technology"" is yet to come.

As the nuclear Doomsday Clock moves closer to midnight than it's been since 1953, David Thomas and a sizable contingent of old allies hunker down in a launch pad turned fallout shelter and bash out the most songful and physically powerful Pere Ubu album of our fraught century. Of course untoward noises abound along with the urgent tempos. But after the searing two-minute ""Red Eye Blues,"" it ends with three more ruminative tracks, each a love song one way or another. First papa invites her out for a walk. Then a guest vocalist designated Roshi turns out to be female. And then begins the finale, crooned high and grainy: ""Hold me close / I feel the time running out / I know you must feel it too.""

Think Feelies (pomo momentum), Only Ones (Perrettistic Kinkology), Chills/Clean (parallel invention), Woodentops (plus musclebottom), maybe even Galaxie 500 (minus wimpophilia).

Title notwithstanding, the most revealing of the many things Mike Hadreas has said about his fourth album concerns the melodies he took it upon himself to fashion first: ""I made sure they had a chorus and a bridge--all the things I have never done before because they felt like work."" A gay man avowedly uncomfortable in his own body, with the Crohn's disease, erotic asphyxiation fixation, and abated addictions to prove it, Hadreas insisted listeners come to him on 2014's strong-willed Too Bright. But here his music meets the rest of us more than halfway. By all means enjoy how the first three tracks all start with a tease before breaking out the rockets' red glare. I prefer ""Just Like Love,"" where a preteen comes out in front of the social media mirror, to ""Slip Away,"" with its risk-drunk ""If you never see 'em coming / You'll never have to hide."" But in both cases the music testifies that for hypersensitives like Hadreas boldness is always an achievement worth melodizing about. It bids for solidarity and deserves it.

FALSE,A-,Discover a Lovelier You,The Pernice Brothers,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12930,"
""Trying to be a better person,"" swears Joe Pernice. But though he provides examples, the title on that one is the all too typical ""Saddest Quo."" So in the end, he proves his good intentions the only way he knows how. Guitars chime, harmonies glide, hooks and choruses stroll by as easily as extras in an impressionist painting--all in the service of such topics as abject poverty, killing someone in a car accident, and our old friend the loss of love. On the loveliest album of Pernice's pretty career, the most eloquent song of all is the wordless title tune.

Compared to rival indie songsmiths, usually younger ones by now, Joe Pernice's contained intensity seems at once conscious and unforced, almost a spiritual thing--though other voices join in, he often sings as if he's harmonizing with himself. Ratcheted up to three-quarters speed at first, this starts off light, even jocular, then slows down to root around in gnarlier stuff. Gnarliest of all is ""The Great Depression,"" which is not about business cycles. Outro goes ""I never wanna die"" 14X into the fade.

Prophesying, imprecating, free-associating, name-dropping, rhyming, gibbering, making animal noises, the big chief of the space police inquires into the demise of King Tubby, shoots the IMF, and conquers Chris Blackwell--among other things, all of which occur in his capacious head over Niney the Observer's equally capacious dub. Never as striking as the record he did for Blackwell, it's considerably more grooveful and sustaining. Open your ears and close your eyes, and he will give you a big surprise.

FALSE,A-,Please,Pet Shop Boys,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2749,"
The music's blandness is part of the quite well-executed concept: articulating the ambivalent romanticism, immodest hopes, and not-so-quiet desperation behind the suburban facade of the people who create Smash Hits pop, and maybe consume it, too. I hum most of the catchily namby-pamby tunes and ponder most of the yearningly cynical lyrics, but the moments I really love are provided by sound effects--sirens and breaking glass so skillfully integrated into the synthesized textures that at first I didn't notice they were there.

Calling Neil Tennant a bored wimp is like accusing Jackson Pollock of making a mess. Since the bored wimp is his subject and his medium, whether he actually is one matters only insofar as the music sounds bored and/or wimpy--and only insofar as that's without its rewards and revelations. From Dusty Springfield to hit Fairlight to heart beats and from insider shopping to kept icon to Bowiesque futurism, this is actual pop music with something actual to say--pure commodity, and proud of it.

Neil Tennant shores up his positivity with a shrug and a question mark. Does love seem arbitrary, ineffable? Well, ""That's the Way Life Is""--""It Always Comes as a Surprise.""

""I only worry for your sake,"" the altruist-as-ironist insists as he wonders where ""Boy Strange"" is with who. Not to worry, he will survive--for as long as he at least hears B.S.'s ""footsteps in the dark.""

The music may well seem too restrained, presumably because Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe figured that on an album where 11 songs find 11 different ways to mock, rue, ponder, and accept their professional mortality, the entitled glee of their full-on disco productions is off the table. Even the explicit ""Your Early Stuff"" and the valedictory ""Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin"" keep a lid on it, the better to fit in with the ones that go ""Look at me, the absentee,"" ""Say it's not so/That you'd rather lose me,"" ""Our love is dead/But the dead don't go away,"" and everything else except the pounding ""A Face Like That,"" which also boasts the only lyric that doesn't follow the program. Whether metaphysical (""Everything means something"") or bitchy (""There's got to be a future/Or the world will end today""), they're at peace with the fate of their fame and their retirement accounts. And the understated beats suit their elysian equanimity.

Sometimes it's hard to remember what a breath of fresh air the gap-spanning MTV figurehead was in 1976. So revisit this automatic multiplatinum, a treasury of power pop that doesn't know its name--snappy songs! Southern beats! gee! Like Billy Joel, say, or the Police, his secret isn't that he's a natural singles artist--it's that he's too shallow to merit full concentration except when he gets it all right, and maybe not then. Petty is the formalist of the ordinary guy, taking his musical pleasure in roots, branches, commerce, art, whatever gets him going without demanding anything too fancy of his brain or his rear end. Footloose by habit and not what you'd call a ladies' man, he often feels confused or put upon, and though he wishes the world were a better place, try to take what he thinks is his and he won't back down. He has one great virtue--his total immersion in rock and roll.

One Whip-Smart remix, one new wave cover, and one undeveloped new song no more fascinating than the five old Girly Sound demos that are why any noncollector should hear this CD. The hands-down keepers are the dirty joke once removed ""California"" and the cowboy-Iggy ""South Dakota,"" but all are a respite from her persona, her career, her sacred mission--none of which she chose, exactly, but none of which she's shown any knack for averting.

Because the excess instruments support a funkier groove (not to mention that they support a groove at all), the six songs on this album convey more of her smarts and soul than the ten on its predecessor--she really gets to signify, even on the two ballads.

Consistent material (lots of twelve-bar) and the complete absence of violins make these sessions--recorded in the mid-to-late '60s, half with big band and half with combo--preferable to the run of her Kudu albums. But that's not to make the purist assumption that the settings are ideal--the combo is a bit too elegant, the charting ordinary. Compare ""Cherry Red"" on Alone Again, Naturally, where modernistic blues from Stuff inspires a funny, pained intimacy, to this one, which begins with Sonny Criss blowing some real blues out from between his colleagues but ends with a climax that compels Phillips to belt for no dramatic reason.

R&amp;b chart-topper at 15, repeat hitmaker with a Ray Price remake, discofied interpreter of Van and Elton as well as her secret sharer Dinah Washington, Phillips died of liver and kidney failure in 1984 and is now somehow classified as jazz. Although she was honorably served by Atlantic's all-the-class-the-market-will-bear aesthetic, her astringent voice zipped with unique authority through schlock like ""Moonglow/Theme From Picnic,"" which is as striking as any of these 40 tracks--although no more so than ""Makin' Whoopee"" or ""Moody's Mood for Love,"" ""Crazy Love"" or ""And I Love Him."" Her vocal gift was narrower than that of her other secret sharer Etta James, but because she knew perpetual disillusion, Phillips was far defter with pretentious lyrics. Her current obscurity is a disgrace. I look forward to a companion package culling her patchy brilliance at Kudu and Mercury.

As a ""life-loving"" jock who can do without female mud-wrestling and people who crash handicapped parking spaces, Phranc is familiar enough as a general type. But little things like her name and her flattop set her off from the Olivia separatists, and so do big things, like her sweet sense of humor and her two-newspapers-a-day habit. After all, you can do without female mud wrestling and people who crash handicapped parking spaces yourself.

FALSE,A-,Tango: Zero Hour,Astor Piazzolla,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=183,"
Until Piazzolla, I never gave a thought to tango, which I conceived vaguely as the music of displaced Europeans slumming their way through an American limbo, compounding angst and self-regard into ridiculous sexual melodrama. But now that I put all that down on paper, it seems both kind of interesting and ripe for destabilization. Piazzolla has been exploring both possibilities since 1946 and claims this is the best of his 40 albums. True semipop, dance music for the cerebellum, with the aesthetic tone of a jazz-classical fusion Gunther Schuller never dreamed.

Suddenly hot in Dollarland at age 67, Piazzolla is flooding the bins, with his earlier American Clave albums reissued by Pangaea (structure and sustained intensity make Tango: Zero Hour an unusually unsoporific CD), a Montreux concert with Gary Burton available from Atlantic Jazz, and a collaboration with Lalo Schifrin out on Nonesuch. Piazzolla has even less to do with jazz than Gary Burton; he's closer to Bartok the composer than to Ellington the orchestrator, and tends to limit improvisatory space. But the symphonic accompaniment of Schifrin, an Argentinian who straddles pop and classical himself, rarely obtrudes and sometimes even amplifies, so those who prefer their exotica with cushions should opt for Concerto para Bandoneon/Tres Tangos. Me, I don't find Piazzolla's music so alien that it can't be absorbed full force, in the acerbically melodramatic compositions he creates for his quin Conceived for a theatre piece, this collection is episodic even given the composer's penchant for abrupt mood shifts. But its historical overview, beginning with the ""primitive"" tango that shook a younger pop world, is just the thing to provide the hint of roots rock and rollers prefer in their exotica. Oh those crazy urban folk.

A song cycle about a Lubbock girl who seeks Jesus on the two-lane black-top of carnal knowledge and ultimately enjoys the just desert of giving birth to Her, this is clearly the product of an abusive childhood.

And what's her dad's idea of living-room conversation? ""I am so horny I'd fuck a rockpile if I thought there was a snake in it."" Fortunately, Jo Carol overcompensates via a verbal hypertrophy she feels compelled to display over a 78-minute album featuring some dozen songs, with equal time for explanations. And she's aided handsomely by a bunch of musicians who are there for her every time she commits suicide.

She overdoes the ballads, but what kind of teen idol could she be if she didn't? She's got turf to claim before dropping ""Dear Mr. President,"" which assumes, correctly, that Bush did coke and teens care about the homeless. If there's a Bono song like that, the stupid world missed it. And if stardom slips through Pink's cleavage, she's got an answer: ""You don't have to like me any more/I've got money now.""

Nine of these 16 tracks are from albums with their own strong identities, including four from the 2001 policy statement Misundaztood, the rest of which holds up fine even without them. Normally, that would be too many. But the same four songs transfer nicely from that concept album to a best-of that salvages the pugnacious ""So What,"" links ""Trouble"" to ""Glitter in the Air,"" and adds two top-shelf Max Martin blends. It's where I will go for a shot of the longterm hitmaker rather than the 21-year-old who's finding herself in public.

No dumb tribulations-of-a-rock-star epic here--the dedication to long-departed crazy Syd Barrett gives it an emotional resolve that mitigates what little self-pity lyricist Roger Waters allows himself. Even more remarkable, the music is not only simple and attractive, with the synthesizer used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that The Dark Side of the Moon simulated so ponderously.

No need to worry about Pinson, who's such a good writer he's got dibs on hits by Tony Keith and Sugarland--only he's such a good writer you'll worry anyway. Like for instance, how come nobody ever heard of this 2007 album he released on his lonesome after RCA ditched him? Could be the booze, right? ""Back in My Drinkin' Days"" could be a bluff, or maybe after a few months of ""Don't Think I Don't Think About It"" he picked up the glass again ""Just to Prove I Could."" But let's assume these are songs merely, no autobiography intended. Let's assume he's real good at getting inside that ""Right to Be Wrong"" mindset, and stretches out into a few heartwarmers like ""This Close to Heaven"" and the Iraq enlistee's ""If I Don't Make It Back"" for good measure. That makes the rawking song ""Past Comin' Back"" the only dumb thing on the record. The guy works in Nashville. Worry.

A lark evolves into a business proposition as an album of 10 inspired three-minute songs eventuates in an album of 12 expert three-and-a-half-minute songs. Because the three principals are still smart and spunky, some of these are superb: the family dysfunction playlet ""Hush Hush,"" the objectification expose ""Being Pretty Ain't Pretty,"" the 'til-death-do-us-part ""I Hope You're the End of My Story."" But because the three principals are Music City pros with a release schedule, some of them are merely expert, and two drag big time: the ensemble's five-minute ""Blues You're a Buzz Kill,"" which is the latter solely, and Angeleena Presley's one-dimensional ""Loved by a Workin' Man,"" which kisses up to the usual Nashville-male chauvinist cliches.

Up until Doolittle in 1989, when the tunes blossomed, I pretty much missed this band. Put off by Black Francis's feyness, I sensed what is now clear, that he's a pomo sociophobe of a familiar and tedious sort. Where in retrospect his philosophical limitations seem harmless annoyances, they portended many regrettable developments in irony, junk culture, sexual eccentricity, and other folkways that deserved better. But that wasn't reason enough to resist the music. In such cases, the recommended m.o. is in the destructive element immerse--understand its attractions from the inside, the better to combat or, what fun, succumb to them. Now Surfer Rosa and the Come On Pilgrim EP seem audaciously funny and musically prophetic. I like the way the elements form a whole without coalescing, and the brushed-aluminum patina they got on their punk-pop-art-metal amalgam. I guess these nine Come On Pilgrim outtakes are a little looser and wilder than the stuff they put on the market, but in retrospect once again they're every bit as much a galvanic hoot.

With Oliver Ackermann a guitar effects tycoon first and a bandleader second, I hear them as an electronica outfit whose inhuman beat happens to be all volumized hard-rock boom-boom, only less funky than that stuff can get with sentient humans leaking flesh and blood on the tubs. What few words you can make out have the rare virtue of straightforwardness and are less miserabilist than you might fear--compelling sex in make-her-scream mode can cheer up a fella whose political-existential irrelevance is getting him down. But the album's logic is musical--even, plausibly, sexual. Beginning with a lyric whose faint eroticism is buried by the two-word theme statement ""all alone,"" it works up to a provisional climax, tails to a lament followed by a dirge, and then explodes into overdrive: ""Why I Can't Cry Anymore,"" Goth dread at its sanest and most desperate, followed by the breakneck rancor of ""Revenge,"" presumably directed at the departed screamer.

Though it was the grim everyday comedy of Egon Bondy's Happy Hearts Club Banned that made it not just a stirring document but the ultimate bootleg album, somehow they've gone and lost their sense of humor. Must have to do with their leaders going to jail and their concert sites getting torched. Yet through it all their sound has remained their own, just about the only ""European""-""rock"" synthesis that never stinks of sentimentality, of pretentiousness. And the aura of dour mockery around Vratislav Brabanec's saxophone on side one gives the odd turns of the lyrics (printed in Czech with translations on the inner sleeve) a significance they couldn't generate on their own. Unfortunately, side two is so dirgelike it'll attract only those with an established appetite for stirring documents. Upped a notch for staying alive anyway.

After I first plucked Plug from my shelves, I assumed he was some new retro-electro guy, but actually he's minor techno legend Luke Vibert, who I've always preferred under his Wagon Christ moniker, just not so's I felt any need to testify about it. (Very) roughly speaking, say Vibert is trancey, Wagon Christ fanciful, and Plug--who in the mid '90s released the Drum'n'Bass for Papa album hard upon three EPs, all still findable as a twofer on Trent Reznor's label--a necromancer. Although the story is that Vibert stumbled upon 10 old Plug tracks and declared them an album on a whim, I'm betting they stayed in the can because they were just too all-over-the-place for 1997. But for those of us who find electronica too functional anyway, all-over-the-place equals content: the willful structures, sonic shifts, interrupted grooves, and goofy vocal bits are as eventful as a good lyric. For once drum'n'bass's impossible Conlon Nancarrow beats, which Plug does pretty well with on those EPs, are the bed where the real music crinkles, crashes, chimes, swoops, swells, squiggles, gurgles, cracks wise, and just generally hooks you. Start with ""Come on My Skeleton"" and ""Back on Time."" Then do yourself a favor and listen fore-to-aft.

After one ground-breaking hit, the only decent regular-release album of their lengthy career adds three more classics to their oeuvre, all in the perfervid robot-disco style of ""I'm So Excited."" And then--and here's the really weird part--it's over. Five years after Break Out, with scads of failed group and solo projects behind and a Motown contract ahead, this postmature best-of lives and dies with the same four robot-disco classics (remixed, though at least not newly remixed) and the same three mainstream gems.

Though they're thought of as slick, no putative pop band of this era has aired more pretensions. The new-agish textural excursions (not the chords and structures that flesh out their tunes) are excised here, but Sting is scarcely less pompous when servicing the marketplace than when expressing himself in the privacy of his own throwaways. From the love object with the dress of red to the dreams of imaginary energy sources, from sexist condescension to Sufi twaddle he's one step up the evolutionary ladder from Billy Joel. He's got loads of musical gifts. He's even got verbal gifts.

If you're thinking Deerhoof, so have others, all of whom are wrong. If you're thinking annoying brats, they could make you testy. They make me chuckle, in amusement and aesthetic delight.

Statistics, statistics. DIY debut: 10 songs, 27 minutes. Yeasayer-financed follow-up: eight songs in 34 minutes. So even excluding the 7:00-exactly ""Celebrate the Body Electric (It Came From an Angel),"" means track length here is up 32 seconds. The sound is bigger too, strengthening a band that's all guitars-drums-vocals sonics--including Molly Siegel's yelping vocables, without which the sound's faux-tween soul and wise-ass tempo shifts would evanesce into abstraction. But down in the basement, prog is building a playhouse. And if the band catches on the way it deserves, that hideout will start looking like a castle.

A shambling prank-turned-tribute reminiscent in conceptual/critical complexity of Actually or Kangaroo?, and if you have no idea what I'm talking about you won't get it. The lead cut, about falling in love with a New Kid, begins with a dim sample from the Raspberries' ""Overnight Sensation"" and steals the melody of Duran Duran's ""Rio."" The tune after that was supposedly lifted from GG Allin. Very catchy, guys and gal. As a rock critic, I love the shit out of it.

I don't approve of retro, never have. But when smart young things discover crappy old records like Frampton Comes Alive! and great old records like Rust Never Sleeps, it can be infectious. The grain of eager pop greed in Hue's Brit-wimp voice, augmented by the earnest craft that enables Paul to stick whole Neil Young solos (copied, not sampled) into borrowed Strangeloves songs, reestablishes the fading distinction between parody and celebration in order to transcend it at a higher level of consciousness--an unselfconscious one.

The line on Iggy is that this comeback album with Bowie and friends proves his creative power has dissipated. I say bullshit. The Stooges recorded prophetic music, but only some of it was great: because Iggy's skill at working out his musical concept didn't match his energy and inspiration, the attempted dirges fell too flat and some of the rockers never blasted off as intended. Dissipated or not, the new record works as a record. By now, Iggy barbs his lyrics with an oldtimer's irony, which suits the reflective tone Bowie has imposed on the music just fine. In retrospect, it will appear that this was Iggy's only alternative to autodestruct. Not true, perhaps, but retrospect favors artifacts. As do I.

If The Idiot exploits the (tranceprone) affinity for the slow rocker that Bowie evinced on Station to Station, this reestablishes the (apollonian) affinity for the dionysiac artist Bowie made so much of five years ago on Mott's All the Young Dudes. Like most rock and rollers, I prefer this to The Idiot because it's faster and more assertive--which means, among other things, that the nihilistic satire is counteracted by the forward motion of the music itself.

Give or take some song-shuffling and a minor substitution, side one of this strange piece of product comprises side one of Ig's 1977 Bowie-produced The Idiot and side two comprises side one of Ig's 1977 Bowie-produced Lust for Life. Makes you think Bowie knew what he was doing--""Jimmy, please, what do you say we put the, ah, less accessible things on the B?"" Though I would have subbed with ""Success,"" that's a quibble on such a consistent album, and though I find that the less accessible things retain their narrow interest, I admit that this is the first time in the '80s it's occurred to me to listen to them. Obviously, no one who owns the originals needs this record, but dollarwise students of that long-ago time should be grateful. Too bad they'll never hear ""Dum Dum Boys.""

Funny thing is, the only time things work out is on the obscure Mama Cass/Mann &amp; Weil cover ""It's Getting Better.""

Dinky where Death Cab for Cutie are merely wimpy, the Benjamin Gibbard-Jimmy Tamborello collab could be designed to put off not just red-blooded testosterone addicts but anyone who thinks music has to feign strength to make itself felt. What it does instead is display staying power. Tunes whose catchiness seemed annoying prove lovely; tunes whose quietude seemed wan prove catchy. Gibbard's delicate voice matches the subtle electro arrangements far more precisely than it does the folky guitars of his real group, and no longer does he express himself in word clusters or dream-state imagery. A female principle keeps giving him what for--in the background, Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis, and up front on the album's centerpiece, Jen Wood--and he needs her too much to mince metaphors.

Her ""Dreams Don't Come True"" and ""High School"" are sharper than most--""Flip the bird to the whores in high school"" and ""It's late September and she's startin' to show,"" respectively. But there's meaner to come as she sweetly guns down the preacher husband she knows like the back of his hand and cattily cuts down the ""beauty mark on the human race"" who ain't blonde enough to play so dumb. And if you wish she was feistier still, figure the reason she isn't in ""Outlaw,"" where she identifies her career goal as ""straight-shootin' hifalutin writer on the hit parade.""

Almost half of this two-record soundtrack comprises previously unreleased live tapes, usually of songs we have in studio versions--some forgettable (the two Chuck Berrys on side three), some historic (the Dorsey-show Joe Turner medley). In any case, the point is documentation, and for once I approve. Even trivia like ""Viva Las Vegas"" and ""G.I. Blues"" work in this context--in fact, it makes the context, just like the interviews (try Hy Gardner's) and intros (Ed Sullivan's).

Peter Guralnick's contention that this blues singer is ""unencumbered by myth or self-consciousness"" doesn't survive the widely admired title (and lead) track. Especially by the late '60s, he's a white boy who knows he's getting fonky--and who doesn't surround himself with especially fonky musicians. So rhythms falter, and arrangements get out of hand. The great singer and hillbilly cat puts his weird stamp on almost every tune anyway. But despite the uncensored ""One Night,"" and the salacious ""Merry Christmas, Baby,"" only once does he outdo himself--on the unreleased Sun master ""Tomorrow Night,"" which was already pretty ethereal in Lonnie Johnson's original.

Tough gals, tough gals--suddenly the world is teeming with tough gals. And Chrissie Hynde is a good one. Maybe not all of her songs are championship singles, but she's got more to offer emotionally and musically (and sexually) than any of the competition, unless Patti counts. She's out for herself but she gives of herself as well; when she alternates between rapacity and tenderness you don't feel she's acting coy or fucked up, although she may be. And she conveys these changes with her voice as well as with her terse, slangy, suggestive lyrics. James Honeyman Scott's terse, slangy, suggestive guitar steals don't hurt either.

""I'm not the kind I used to be/I've got a kid, I'm thirty-three"" is certainly a quotable quote, and whether rock-and-rolling her baby or growling at fat cats Chrissie Hynde backs it up. It's as if two deaths in the family plus her fruitful union with Ray Davies have convinced her beyond any lingering adolescent doubt that other people are there; Chrissie the fuck-off queen always had these humanistic attitudes in her, and it's good to hear her make the thin line between love and hate explicit. Unfortunately, they're still only attitudes, which is to say that like her mate she hasn't thought them through all that much, and as a result the impressive songcraft here doesn't bear hard scrutiny. But since unlike her mate she keeps her nostalgia under control, she gets her comeback anyway.

You can catch more pop with misery than you can with connubial bliss, and whether she's feeling her losses or picking up the get-down, Chrissie Hynde is on her game again. Unlikely highlights include a medium-tempo take-me-back plea, a sendup of class war, an obscurely nasty animal-rights song, and yet another medium-tempo take-me-back plea.

Pretenders songs post-Learning To Crawl emulated the concision and riff-riding lyricism""Brass in Pocket"" while doing without the passion and focus that made it so fiercely erotic, so vivacious and fuck-you, so independent, so special. They felt pop, felt tuneful and shaped and legibly emotional, but in the end they were atmospheric. Here Chrissie Hynde's writing is sharp again--the riffs have an edge, the lyrics bite. There's some strong Janis Joplin soul, a pretty ballad in Spanish I bet her young Colombian husband understands, a closer with the ridiculously in-character refrain ""You bring the biker out in me,"" a line that goes ""It's only baby's breath"" in your head long after it's over. And the grudge she bears against the opener's ""Popstar"" is such a joy to her that she rides the ""Hang On Sloopy"" motive as if she thought of it yesterday, driving three consecutive song-doctored classics before her: one that references her circulatory system, one that advises love ""From the Heart Down,"" and one that begins with the latest sally in the class war she'll never surrender: ""If this is public transportation/What are you doing here?""

Of course Chrissie Hynde's not ""back."" She never went away, and if this record proves anything it's that she never will--as long as she gets a production budget. Figure she got into a spiky mood after 1999's Viva El Amor failed to impress radio or her U.S. label of 20 years. Where that album demonstrated the emotional utility of a comfortable tune, here the Steinberg-Kelly plush is down to two tracks and doesn't quite go with material that finds its spirit in the persistence of punk and its soul in reggae basslines. For a 51-year-old who refuses to act her age, pretty convincing. Stick her on one of those diva specials and watch her snarl.

For three EPs now become one 27-minute CD, they thrash out herky-jerk bombardiering, guitar abrasions that won't go away, and themes, classic themes: alienation, separation, betrayal, all that negative intensity. The counterbalance is a golden age they strive to re-create in the present tense: ""And nothing else matters/When I turn it up loud."" Probably the struggle will prove too much in the end.

There's nothing like this Rock and Roll Hall of Famer from the Big Easy. Now 80 and pushing an autobiography and a Broadway musical based on same, he knows how to take care of business--he's a rough hombre who owned a nightclub and a label in Manhattan before he was 40. But he doesn't sing like a rough hombre. He sings like he's taking care of business, which is why he followed 1959's chart-topping ""Stagger Lee"" with two lyrics so insipid they could do battle with Frankie Avalon and Bobby Rydell: ""Personality"" and ""I'm Gonna Get Married."" And never was he more cheerfully pragmatic than in the 2:25 ""Stagger Lee"" itself, which remains a fairly grisly murder tale, but one in which the femme chorus that's been chanting ""Go Stagger Lee"" since 0:45 continues to cheer Stack on as he fetches his .44 and shoots Billy so bad he breaks the bartender's glass. Call me a cynic, but I think it's one of the funniest records in rock and roll. It leads this hard-to-find 18-track package. It also leads the now standard 12-track, 28-minute The Best of Lloyd Price: The Millennium Collection, where I miss, among other things, ""That's Love,"" a/k/a ""I Got Married and Liked It,"" and ""Three Little Pigs,"" designed for what he thinks marriage was designed for, and I don't mean conjugal ecstasy.

Her Illinois-to-Nashville drawl is as precise as her word choices even if her ""You wouldn't know class if it bit you in the ass"" can't match the gusto of Loretta Lynn, whose ""Fist City"" midwifed its melody. But from ""Four Years of Chances,"" which lays out the slog of a neglectful marriage mainly so she can crow about the attentive one that came next, to ""Weekender,"" in which her old man is too broke to bail her out of jail, her clarity has a gusto of its own.

Voicewise, as brilliant as Vernon Dalhart, Ray Price, George Jones. Contentwise, as wan as Red Foley, Ronnie Milsap, Eddie Rabbitt. Only for Pride, wan was perverse. A deeply ambitious sharecropper's son who moved up to Montana to pursue his first love, baseball, and settled for a job smelting zinc, Pride didn't stand out because he could dip from tenor to bass in well-enunciated middle-American smeared with drawl and flanged with vibrato. He stood out because he wasn't white. Although it wasn't easy becoming the only black country star ever, once he got over the hump he was the perfect token for Southern traditionalists eager to find safe common ground with the civil rights movement. Stylistically honky-tonk when Nashville was trying to be modern, he was never thematically honky-tonk--no drinking songs, God knows no catting songs. Yet his skin color was inescapable. From this Mississippi emigre the pro forma can't-go-home-again of ""Wonder Could I Live There Anymore"" was an indictment, ""voice of Uncle Ben"" and all. And how to read the cornball complacency of ""I'm Just Me"": ""I was just born to be/Exactly what you see/Nothing more or less/I'm not the worst or the best/I just try to be/Exactly what you see""? Early on some well-wisher suggested he bill himself George Washington Carver III. But that would have been taking on airs, he'd stick with his own name thankee, and look what it was.

Like the cocky high speed of the brazenly redundant ""Baby I'm a Star,"" the demurely complaisant ""Thank you"" that answers ""You're sheer perfection"" signals an artist in full formal flower, and he's got something to say. Maybe even a structure: the frantic self-indulgence of ""Let's Go Crazy"" gives way to a bitter on-again-off-again affair that climaxes in the loving resignation of the title song--from in-this-life-you're-on-your-own to in-this-life-heaven-is-other-people (and-you're-still-on-your-own). But insofar as his messages are the same old outrageous ones, they've lost steam: ""1999"" is a more irresistible dance lesson for the edge of the apocalypse than ""Let's Go Crazy,"" ""Head"" and ""Jack U Off"" more salacious than the groundout ""Darling Nikki.""

Only the tin-eared will overlook the unkiltered wit of its pop-baroque inventions, only the lead-assed deny its lean, quirky grooves, both of which are so arresting that at first you don't take in the equally spectacular assurance with which the singer skips from mood to mood and register to register. I just wish the thing weren't such a damn kaleidoscope: far from unifying its multifarious parts, its soundtrack function destroys what little chance the lyrics have of bringing it together. Christopher is Prince, I guess, but nothing here tempts me to make sure.

I confess I'm too square to regale the guests at my all-ages dance party with ""Sexy M.F.,"" a title extended to six syllables in its recorded version.

But anybody expecting a kissoff or a throwaway radically underestimates his irrepressible musicality. Apropos of nothing, here's a guitar album for your earhole, enhanced by a fresh if not shocking array of voices and trick sounds and cluttered now and then by horns.

But he's not throwing them away; you can tell because he's no longer slurring like 8 A.M. on the Tuesday of a lost weekend.

He says he put a lot into his first album in five years because he figured it might be his last ever, which it won't be; I attribute its undeviating quality, gratifying variety, and amazing grace to talent, leisure time, and just enough all-star input.

Barely produced, too--quiet g-b-d touched by occasional piano riffs or organ colors, with a few numbers just strummed-and-sung in a voice I never thought I'd say was going because it was already gone when it got here. It daydreams some in the middle, too. Yet it's a keeper to be grateful for, and grateful he is. ""Eternity is approaching fast,"" he notes in the ""old folks home"" singalong ""Crazy Bone,"" and he's not always so jaunty about it. But in the end, he gets to heaven, where he forgives his enemies, re-enters show business, reconnects with every single aunt, and smokes ""a cigarette that's nine miles long.""

FALSE,A-,Live on the Queen Mary,Professor Longhair,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2822,"
Roy Byrd's pianistic intricacies--which inspired Fats Domino, Huey Smith, Allen Toussaint, Dr. John, and other New Orleans luminaries--come through better on this live recording than on Atlantic's '50s compilation. This I credit to the hazardously busy (and uncredited) bass-and-drums accompaniment, which provides enough movement down below to allow Prof to really get rolling up top. Blues backup isn't supposed to work that way, but these guys get away with it, and good for them. P.S. Prof sings off-key a lot. P.P.S. It doesn't matter--sometimes it's even cute.

Everybody should own a Longhair album, and this exceptionally consistent 1974 session--which adds two tracks and a hotter piano mix to the sporadically available French version--won't disappoint. It's got Gatemouth Brown on guitar and fiddle and makes an excellent companion piece to Alligator's peakier Crawfish Fiesta, with which it shares a tough uptempo edge and zero songs, not even ""Bald Head"" or ""Tipitina."" It does, however, duplicate a lot of material on Atlantic's endlessly seductive double live Last Mardi Gras. So cogitat emptor, and kudos to none other than George Winston for making such reflection possible in the good old U.S.A.

If you don't know why Fess is a national treasure of obstinate localism--not rock and roll or blues or even r&amp;b, just Nworlins--these lost recordings from just after his 1971 revival will teach you a lesson. Fess's wobbly vocals and careening piano apotheosized the city's crazy independence the way Allen Toussaint's did (if not does) its pop affability. With eight of fifteen songs otherwise available, novices can skip it if they promise to start somewhere else. Treasure hunters need only be apprized that Snooks Eaglin is on every track and Ziggy Modeliste behind four.

Though the fourth side drags and nothing on the first three is as visionary as the title cut on Bicentennial Nigger, there are a lot fewer nightclub quips and sight gags, and Pryor's warmth has heat. Next best thing to the movie.

With one slow and excellent exception and a few deviations, all 13 punky songs on the second album by the first (recorded) band built around Alabama's twin Crutchfield sisters are defined by a crude, catchy, commonplace guitar riff and proceed over drumming that keeps its figuration simple and repetitive when it doesn't bang outright. Simultaneously hesitant and forthright, singer Katie Crutchfield sounds above all brave as she pronounces and occasionally mispronounces her lyrics, which dwell on botched communication both verbal and emotional. Her language is usually plain (""Your eyes go crossed like mine/You'll regret that when you're older"") but sometimes gawkily high-flown (""Your endeared negligence,"" ""The cold and correlated closely flock""). On my favorite track, ""Pink Sheets,"" it combines the two: ""Rose quartz, star charts/We heal our broken hearts/With warped reality/And practical psychology."" But always there is the sound of becoming that the young treasure for one reason and the ex-young value for quite another.

They're a posthippie band who satirize hippie fatuousness as well as a punk-era band who send up anti-hippie orthodoxy, but I love them for simpler reasons: they're great junk and they sound like the Sex Pistols. Richard Butler's phrasing and intonation owe so much to Johnny Rotten's scabrous caterwaul that he's got to be kidding and ripping him off simultaneously, and the calculated rave-ups recall the overall effect sought by the punk godfathers, who were always somewhat grander than their speedy, compulsively crude epigones. That's what makes the Furs great junk--it can't be great unless the possibility remains that it's really pretentious.

It's not band breakdown (Duncan Kilburn's sax replaced, John Ashton's guitar gone) nor pop sellout (Todd Rundgren in for Steve Lillywhite at the board) nor tired songcraft (hookier than the junk-punk debut if more ornate than the powerhouse follow-up) that makes this quite entertaining album less than credible. It's the half-life of cynicism as a public stance. Last time Richard Butler's surprising new emotionality made for a winning world-weariness, but this time it sounds just slightly pat, more or less what you'd expect from a quite likable phony.

FALSE,A-,Should God Forget: A Retrospective,The Psychedelic Furs,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6055,"
Punk engenders postpunk, which incorporates--these guys are English, after all--its essential prepunk Bowie-Ferry axis, but bypasses its equally essential pub, garage, and roots axes. All operative imperatives are purely aesthetic, powered by vagaries of taste, quiddities of form, and oddities of talent; however inevitable the resulting music may have sounded, it was obviously all pose, and just as it had no cultural significance then, it has no historical significance now. All it does is go around on its track and sound good--surprisingly good, considering how meaningless it is, and how inexorably it descends toward sounds-bad. With sincerity off the table, and tune and performance steady as they go, the great puzzle then becomes why the band couldn't keep it up. Because aesthetic imperatives have a moral life just like cultural and historical ones, that's why.

For a time PE's confrontational music/ideology compelled young blacks to hope that consciousness would get them somewhere, and don't think it was the limitations of Chuck's worldview that left them hanging. He never said it would be as easy as pop fans always expect, but he must have figured racism was a little more tractable than this. And when it wasn't, well, here came da gangstas--copping instant gratification for the padded jeepbeats they dealt, they talked tough and stayed out of the man's way. Taken for granted as an elder statesman by the young turks who are always coming up, resented for leading on middle-class followers who've since discovered War and Rose Royce, what can poor Chuck D. do 'cept rap in a rock and roll band? So he harangues and excoriates same as always, his dense rhetoric deep with puns, his hard beats charging you up just when you think the enamel on your bicuspids will never be the same. Over and above the gangsta-dissing ""So Whatcha Gone Do Now?"" and the ecology-dropping ""Bedlam 13:13,"" half these tracks dynamite the harshly layered formula one way or another and the other half reprise a great sound. Some kind of funk, I swear, and if I understand the complaints that they sound like a damn alternative rock group, well, I always did--that's one reason I love them.

Chuck D has always thought fresh beats were for pussies--keeping up with the times is a job for communications technology. So the four remixes were organized over the Internet by hardcore PE fans, who like semipop audiences everywhere accentuate what's most extreme and inaccessible about their faves, and never mind the Bomb Squad's r&amp;b shake-and-bake on He Got Game.  Fortunately, the old sound is hard in new ways, from the slow-and-snaky synth DJ Functionalist lays below ""Shut Em Down"" to ""What Good Is a Bomb"" raging against the machine. With the preacherly rotundity aged out of Chuck D's larynx and live drums just making ""Put It Up"" leaner, PE's music has never been so unforgiving. With a son-of-a-Bush leading us to perdition, what's to forgive? You know times are desperate when Griff starts making sense.

PE's best album in nearly a decade was overseen by Oakland Muslim-stockbroker-revolutionary Paris, who puts his stamp on its functional funk and unyielding class consciousness. In fact, with its international perspective and bitter ""People on the bottom kill each other for scraps, ""Paris's ""Hannibal Lecture"" boasts the sharpest lyric on the record. But he's got competition--from a retrofitted Jesse Jackson, from Professor Griff if you can believe that, even from reality TV 'ho Flavor Flav: ""I'm in your mouth when you wake in the morning/I'm the stink on your breath when you're yawning."" But mostly, of course, from Mistachuck, whose musicality carries the record--and who folded in a Katrina song after the CD was done.

Not only are their albums still good, they're getting better. Beats keep changing, too. Most of these are by the kind of heavy guitar-bass-drums unit Chuck D has coveted since Anthrax-the-band was bigger than anthrax-the-disease, and intermittently there are also uncredited horns, keyb effects, scratching and backup singers, like the child chorus who recites the message of ""Sex, Drugs and Violence"": ""We like those gangsta rhymes/Just make sure they don't corrupt our minds/These rappers kill and thieve/A lot of times it's only make believe."" Flav remains a knave on TV and the king's fool in PE. And though the title's moral braggadocio has been one of Chuck's more pigheaded tropes since he was dissing soaps, the Don Imus flap has imparted to him an aura of contemporaneity that comes none too soon.

After a decade-plus of preaching the singles gospel and trying to outsmart a digital music system he saw coming and secretly fears has no room for fiftysomethings, Chuck D gathers his forces for two albums released back-to-back--numbers five and six of the new millennium for all his singles talk, and like most of them, pretty damn good. This one's preferred because there's more Flav on it. Preacher Chuck needs William Drayton's nuttiness no matter how corrupt it's become, in part because its corruption is a corrective to all of Chuck's conceptualizing. Although young beatmakers echo the old Bomb Squad whomp, the preacher has lost some boom vocally, and like his cadences, the politics are old-school--a term he disparages, preferring ""classic rap."" But as he explains at length in ""still necessary"" liner notes unavailable from iTunes, which had an exclusive on this music for months before physicals became available from the evil empire of online everything, the times justify those old politics more than ever.

In which former three-chord savage J. Lydon turns self-conscious primitivist, quite sophisticated in his rotten way. PIL complements Lydon's civilized bestiality by reorganizing the punk basics--ineluctable pulse, impermeable bass, attack guitar--into a full-bodied superaware white dub with disorienting European echoes. Much of the music on this double-LP version of the exorbitant three-disc, forty-five r.p.m. Metal Box is difficult; some of it fails. But the lyrics are both listenable and readable, and thanks to the bass parts even the artiest instrumentals have a leg up on, to choose a telling comparison, Brian Eno's. Don't say I didn't warn you, though--it may portend some really appalling bullshit. No matter what J. Lydon says, rock and roll doesn't deserve to die just because it's twenty-five years old. J. Lydon will be twenty-five years old himself before he knows it.

Puceanu was indeed beloved in Bucharest, and playing her album twice proves she deserved to be. To call her the Gypsy Holiday or Piaf is to diminish her individuality: She's more virtuosic than either without showing off, and less pained whatever the cultural baggage of her appointed repertoire. Led by the two cousins who discovered her, the band is her other half--clean, swift, and economical--with Aurel Gore's violin determining the tone, Victor Gore's accordion dominating the coloration, and some cymbalom whiz or other tearing up the background.

I balked because I loved the dark inevitability of my live tape, but for you, the problem will more likely be their provincial notion of good rock and roll--of ""rock."" And to make our unease mutual, new guitarist Tadeus Vercak's articulated strut and ex-guitarist Josef Janicek's high keybs skirt schlock-metal flash and art-rock ostinato respectively. But this is just the American studio version, complete with digital definition and dollops of English, of a music whose strength has always been a stylistic commitment, misprised though it may be, that has nothing to do with rock and rollers' provincial notions of the latest in consciousness. Existential anxieties that might merit a postcollegiate sneer in America spoke for the people in Stalinist Prague and continue to signify in the ur-Bush version. Ditto for lovingly nurtured musical melodrama that seems more inevitable every time through.

Cut the night after the U.S. debut of the Plastic People Mach II, which produced the never-released board tape I called Live at P.S. 122 when I named it my favorite recording of 1989, this subtracts a two-song encore and adds local avant-Slavophiles Elliott Sharp on saxophone and Gary Lucas on guitar. Unbeknownst to me till I examined the booklet, it also translates half my concert review into Czech. I'm flattered, but I still prefer my blunter, wilder version. The power of this music is its reclamation of arena-rock as motor of liberation, and this illusion is not enhanced by embellishment or distraction. On the other hand, it isn't demolished by them either. Covering William Blake and Lou Reed, deploying cello as low-tech synthesizer, betting all their marbles on a lead singer who's six months pregnant, they rock out as if they can make walls fall.

This year won't produce a more indispensable song than ""Common People,"" but that doesn't mean young Americans know enough about the bourgeoisie to get it. And when sex gods are added up, Bryan-Ferry-plus-Blurandoasis won't equal George Michael. But beyond his devotion to songcraft, Cocker isn't Bluroroasis--Culture Club with lyrics is more like it. Smart and glam, swish and het, its jangle subsumed beneath swelling crescendos or nagging keybs and its rhythms steeped in rave, this isn't pat enough for the disco-still-sucks crowd. And although Cocker's stick-to-itiveness over four expendable albums suggests that he's attained a measure of maturity, his breakthrough is a mutation, not a fruition. If ""Common People"" should fall short, I recommend Island proceed directly to ""Something Changed,"" a happy love song every bit as clever and realistic as his class war song.

From Chicago and topped on this overdue mixtape only by the inevitable cameo from the unbeatable Chance the Rapper, Purp achieves the tricky street-versus-conscious balancing act bobbled by J. Cole and Vince Staples alike. Raw sequence indicates what we'd figure--that this is an ex-dealer if that. Basically he just rhymes as a striver from a place where avenues of advancement are few, dropping a mean verse about a nine-to-five he had once along the way. He craves brands and chases pussy; he worries about his daughter and his grandma and his brother dying in prison; he disses hood fatalism and black-on-black crime; he keeps growing without making a big deal of it. So why shouldn't my favorite jam-as-jam here have ""her on the camera going down in the photobooth""? He almost makes it seem like fun.

The grand beats are safer than the clenched, confining, arrogantly hookless minimalism of Hell Hath No Fury. But every mean word delivers, and with cameos from Tyler the Creator to 50 Cent it's as if he never went solo. Like it or not, the volume dealer who raps for pocket money remains a good act--does he sound miserable in his thousand-dollar sneakers. Of course, we who buy our footwear online may prefer the price of the mixtape where half these tracks surfaced last spring.

Three radically different songs by the band/concept's de facto spokeswoman, former and probably future Russian political prisoner Nadya Tolokno. ""Make America Great Again"" opts for positive messaging in re Vladimir Putin's Greatest Shithead: ""Let other people in/Listen to your women/Stop killing black children"" over a Yank pal's catchy strum. Producer Dave Sitek goes full earworm on the pro-sex feminism of ""Straight Outta Vagina,"" whose ""Don't play stupid don't play dumb/Vagina's where you're really from"" has been tagged for cis-sexism by a Pitchfork reviewer who failed to address the related grievances of the Caesarian section community. And then there's the avant-hypnotic Russian-language ""Organs,"" which translates, for example: ""Female orgasm faces obstacles/My strap-ons are being replaced with uniforms and icons."" All three come with YouTube videos, two gruesome and at least one not altogether implausible if you grant that female political prisoners are in for accelerating levels of sexual abuse.

Of course, the Gof4 hoped to change the world, where Pylon mean only to transcend it, which is only possible till the music's over.

Just because it's more specific, changing mood and color decisively from track to track, it doesn't exert the same kind of generalized ambient hold, but it sure does have its own gestalt: the avant-garde equivalent of the great album Duane Eddy never made.

Its presiding genius is master guitarist Djelimady Tounkara, backbone of the three maddening double-CDs that now constitute the band's legacy. Each set is dominated by four-to-10-minute recordings from 1973 to 1977, with synthed-up '80s tracks snuck in here and there, and though it's possible true cognoscenti can fathom an organizational logic that goes unexplained in the notes, I cannot. My mind tells me that the first volume is the least accessible not because it's appreciably earlier but because it seeks out deep-Malian lyrical content. And my eabsence of the jaw-dropping best-of this project has in it, Keita's inspirational ""Mansa,"" Kante's gorgeous ""Mamadou Boutiqui,"" and grooves reliably vigorous and hypnotic by turn make Vol. 2 where to start.

FALSE,A-,Boys and Diamonds,Rainbow Arabia,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15382,"
Arabia? What Arabia? Euro synth duo, tuneful and sometimes haunting, always droney fun--textured, beaty lines under an unnaturally high-voiced girly-woman singing lyrics of no importance when you can make them out, which isn't often. Then I learned: L.A. husband-and-wife duo, latter named Tiffany, her accented English one affectation among many. They hit upon their sound after purchasing a Casio preprogrammed with microtonal scales and Middle Eastern rhythm bits, both of which loom larger on their two mildly enjoyable EPs. Hence a hopefully intentioned band name unlikely to further the cause of peace in a war-torn world where those scales and rhythms have been adopted as silly pop staples already. Think Fever Ray sans dark side. Better still, don't think at all.

FALSE,A-,Heroes of the Blues: The Very Best of Ma Rainey,Ma Rainey,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15746,"
Because she recorded for the famously cheapjack Paramount label, connecting with the woman that label dubbed ""The Mother of the Blues"" can be tough--cleaned up though they were, many vinyl-era reissues sound like she's singing behind a closed door. But specialists generally single out Yazoo's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom vinyl as a significant improvement, the CD version improves on that, and this much later collection improves on the Yazoo. This is easy to tell because five of Yazoo's 14 selections are also among Shout! Factory's 16, including the actively catchy warhorse ""Oh Papa Blues."" Just one example of Rainey's commitment to the Southern tent-show circuit, where she thrived for two decades before she began recording at 37, is her transformation of the lines Bessie Smith rendered as the copyrighted but unidiomatic ""And if you care for me/You will listen to my plea"" into the wilder ""I'm almost goin' insane/I'm forever tryin' to call his name."" But her peak was the braggadocious ""Prove It on Me Blues,"" where the third verse catches me up every time: ""Went out last night with a crowd of my friends/They must have been women 'cause I don't like no men."" Because Rainey was muffled in the studio and assigned second-rate songs, she signifies most readily as history--black history, women's history, musical history. But because she reveled in a roughness avoided by the showgirls who put their names on so much classic blues, and because she felt natural fronting jug bands and ad hoc New Orleans ensembles, the soul, grit, and fun she was full of get closer to the surface with every advance in mastering technology.

FALSE,A-,Bonnie Raitt,Bonnie Raitt,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=402,"
A singer-guitarist (and occasional composer) who renders all the Collins/Baez melodrama superfluous. Raitt is a folkie by history but not by aesthetic. She includes songs from Steve Stills, the Marvelettes, and a classic feminist blues singer named Sippie Wallace because she knows the world doesn't end with acoustic song-poems and Fred McDowell. An adult repertoire that rocks with a steady roll, and she's all of twenty-one years old.

I hear people asking when Bonnie is going to do something new, but conveying songs from Calypso Rose and Martha Reeves Vandella into the women's music of the '70s is new enough for me. I must admit, though, that neither statement is enhanced by association with the folkies whose ballads she favors--too pretty, too ordinary.

Although Paul Rothchild edited Bonnie's road band as painstakingly as he did the El Lay pros of Home Plate, this came out sounding unfashionably raw, almost live, because instead of punching in the perfect note and the clean tone he went for the most intense moment available from months of takes. I don't like ""Runaway,"" which is flat and plodding and wrong for her, and I wish there were a stunner like ""Good Enough"" or ""Sweet and Shiny Eyes"" here. But Bonnie is singing rougher than ever before. Anyone who can induce me to dance to Eric Kaz has got to be doing some kind of job.

On The Glow the present-day female interpreter refused to die, and now she does even better by the suspect notion of good ol' you-know-what. The strength of this album runs too deep to rise up and grab you all at once, so you might begin with ""Me and the Boys,"" arch as usual from NRBQ but formally advanced pull-out-the-stops (with all postfeminist peculiarities accounted for) when Bonnie and the boys get down on it. Other starting points: ""I Can't Help Myself,"" in which she takes more helpings than she can count, and ""River of Tears,"" in which Eric Kaz rocks one more once.

FALSE,A-,Road Tested,Bonnie Raitt,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=411,"
Her supposed comeback in fact a breakthrough, she never approached gold back in the day, and hence was never big enough for a live album until now. This is lucky timing, because Grammy-era bland-out rarely dulls her concerts, where her roots-respectin' rockers come out raunchy, her tender ballads casually intimate. So even if you love Nick of Time, this two-CD mix of old songs and new illustrates why Raitt became an icon while Ronstadt turned into a gargoyle. She creates a world in which Bruce Hornsby and Bryan Adams project as much soul as Ruth Brown and Charles Brown. She's so free of ironic impurities she sings ""Burning Down the House"" as if it means one thing. And her parting words aren't ""Take care of yourselves""--they're ""Take care of each other.""
"
FALSE,A-,Fundamental,Bonnie Raitt,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=412,"
I'd rest easier claiming this album sounds like middle-aged sex--creaky, caring, not shy about adjusting its groove--if it weren't for the other thing it sounds like, which is the debut album she cut with a bunch of folkie eccentrics when she was 21. So just say it sounds like Bonnie Raitt, old before her time as always. Songwise it's a little less consistent than Luck of the Draw, but now that Don Was has withdrawn there's finally some mess to go with her slide--Tchad Blake's kind of mess, in which junk is recycled into decor and everybody leaves coffee cups on the speaker cases. Some of them come from Starbucks. Some are straight out the vending machine. Some are Fiestaware originals.

They're more Wire fans than Wire imitators--looser and louder, comfortable with their middle-class roots in a time when identifying middle class is just a fancier way to point out that you're oppressed. Nevertheless, a fuller sound can be a problem for a band that sounds something like Wire. Suddenly dynamic tension alone won't do--you start aiming for rock, for songs, for anthems like ""22 Grand Job,"" more universal than the immortal ""I Am the Fly"" itself. Unless you're way too big for dynamic tension, you won't nail all that many. But you may get close, like on the U.S.-only ""All Too Human."" And for sure you'll be dynamic. ""T Bone""! ""Terror!""! One after the other!

I know number six comes off corny compared to the aural rush and conceptual punch of their first (or third) (fourth even). But song for song it sure beats the fifth, and in future centuries it's not gonna sound all that different from Ramones Leave Home--less focused, maybe, but fun anyway. And I want to know what future centuries will make of American rock having left its first anti-KKK song to an announced Reaganite.

""I'm just a guy who likes to get drunk/I'm just a guy who likes to dress punk,"" Joey chants as side one fades away, incisively and affectionately locating the real audience he's brought into being after all these years of mythos and stabs in the dark. And despite one hopeless lyric (Dee Dee on Disneyland) and one dubious cover (token pure pop to balance off double-O soul remembrances of the Chambers Brothers and the Music Explosion), this is more worthy of an audience than anything they've done in the '80s. Not a mass audience, certainly not a great audience, maybe not even a cool one--just guys who have finally discovered a taste for the raw roar the Ramones invented (bigger now but no less tuneful) and are smart enough to know that when Joey goofs his way through the five syllables of ""psy-che-del-i-cized"" he's some singer.

More like an old country singer (George Jones leaving Epic, say) than the world's greatest rock and roll band (greater than Mick's side project, anyway), Joey and whoever (Johnny credited on guitar, Dee Dee cowriting two good songs, Marky ditto, C.J. singing Dee Dee) do right by their formula. Reasons to believe: the Dee Dee ballad Joey sings, and the Beach Boys tribute that goes, ""Touring, touring, it's never boring.""

FALSE,A-,It's Alive,Ramones,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3807,"
Redundant when it was dropped on the punk-besotted U.K. in 1979, this concert is precious history now--seems so impossibly light and quick it makes you suspect they didn't fully sustain their live pace into their forties after all. Partly it's repertoire--the 28 songs reprise their three best albums, and all but a couple are still classics. Mostly, though, it's Tommy, who hung in for five years without ever turning show drummer. They needed Marky (and Richie) to drive them on. But it was Tommy who designed the vehicle.

FALSE,A-,Between the Times and the Tides,Lee Ranaldo,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15645,"
Never much of a singer even by Sonic Youth standards and always abrasive solo, Ranaldo applies his best-in-band chops to riffage and filigree so lovely his well-meaning and far from altogether tuneless plainsong has the welcome effect of situating the guitar in the same reality occupied by his lyrics, which always make sense and often seem a mere detail away from total lucidity. Throughout he recaptures the repose of A Thousand Leaves's ""Hoarfrost,"" his will to reconciliation and renewal always palpable whether the songs reach out or recalibrate his options. Just the album you'd hope from a thoughtful 56-year-old after his band of 30 years breaks up. Best in show is ""Angles,"" a love song to someone he knows well and can always stand to know better. Not a bandmate, either.
"
FALSE,A-,Electric Trim,Lee Ranaldo,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17175,"
In the Sonic Youth days, Ranaldo's solo forays were even further out than Kim's or Thurston's, but that was then. Now he's that lost band's only committed bandleader. Sometimes dubbed the Dust, it's a good one, assured and realistic and dissonant: Alan Licht guitar, Tim Luntzel bass, Steve Shelley drums. Insofar as it doesn't energize the base, that's probably because its emotional center is equanimity, an emotional state less sexy than the similar calm--it's too cerebral, too achieved. Impressed myself, I attribute it to some combination of limited vocal compass and getting the divorce out of the way when he was young--his first Dust album bears the credit ""Lyric consultant, muse, etc.: Leah Singer,"" his wife-collaborator since 1991. The selling point of album three is that Jonathan Lethem cowrote five of the nine lyrics, including those that turn on ""But it's always the same thing--you had a view of your own / Everyday feelings--like seeds that get sown,"" ""Are you scared of a woman's love? (No-no-no I'm not) / Are you scared of a man's love? (No-no-no I'm not),"" and ""You've got everything, that diamond ring / Some fine time left to die / So listen closely to your own sweet talk of nuthin'."" But they're no better than Ranaldo's solely-writtens, the most striking ""Let's Start Again,"" which has a happy ending--even a happy middle.
"
FALSE,A-,Last Night on Earth,Lee Ranaldo and the Dust,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16144,"
There's a sweetness to Ranaldo's new music that his better-known band would have drowned out. And not only is this slept-on follow-up graced by melodies that band's tunings would have buried--beauties sometimes--but his singing, while still talkier than even the alt-rock norm, has turned tender, elegiac, lyrical. His guitar's mellower and more reflective as well. Perennial alt-NYC sideman Alan Licht sounds right at home. So does the drummer, one Steve Shelley. Play loud, so its lyricism reveals itself--which doesn't stop it from building to the avant-jams his better-known band specialized in and the play-loud dictum was invented for.

FALSE,A-,. . . And Out Come the Wolves,Rancid,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2872,"
Third time out they're as far ahead of the Offspring as they are behind the Clash. Musically, their oi-ska 'core has got it going on--the 19 anthems start catchy, rev up the guitar in the middle, tail off to catch their breath, and climax with two war chants and a piece of personal invective that I hope isn't about Green Day because that would be petty. But their words only go halfway, which matters when you honor the literal and print your lyrics--their stories vague out, their slogans implode, and their politics have no future. Even in punk terms, they're not great singers either. Not only won't they change the world, they won't change rock and roll. Which is no reason not to wish them well.
"
FALSE,A-,Life Won't Wait,Rancid,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2873,"
With punk revivalism deemed almost as uncouth as frat-boy ska in these postalt times, the three-year hiatus since . . . And Out Come the Wolves may have flattened the rep of one of the few bands to get either style right. That's how pop works--you work your claim, times change, you lose. But art is more forgiving, and aesthetically, this beaty disc is an improvement--snakier in the bass and loopier in the vocals, careening forward in a lovely confusion that never approaches thrash or march (well, maybe march). Whatever their ideas about black lung, glass-pipe murder, baseball bats in Poland, liberty failed liberty, and love redeeming love, they make you glad they have feelings about them--and convinced that for once you know the difference between feeling and pose.
"
FALSE,A-,Indestructible,Rancid,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12124,"
The Clash invented punk politics, and got pretty complex about them. Rancid ran with punk politics, which in Berkeley were burned into the subculture as deep as the three-chord forcebeat. Their big ideas and deep convictions are about their scene, not their society, and they devote their warmest album ever to celebrating and justifying that scene, which they rightly see as global. Sure it would be nice if they put their all into offing Bush, but it would also be nice if the Democrats did. Instead, Rancid offer an inside look at a ready-made dissident voting bloc, toggling back and forth from defeated to defiant as they pursue their little happinesses. Wesley Clark is so smart I'm sure he can get this constituency to the polls.

As rock concepts go these days, the idea of making like the fourth-best bar band in Wichita Falls is plenty warm-blooded, so that even though I disapprove in theory of the loud, klutzy dynamics of this ex-punk country-rock, its zeal wins me over every time. Helps that they leave ""Wabash Cannonball"" etc. off the album and explain their excellent motives in their own words, fleshed out with a few of the guitar licks they found lying around that bar.

There's definitely something off about these country punks, and I think it's that they're serious. Where the Scorchers, Meat Puppets, and Replacements come on crazy, the good times here give off an aura of formal discipline and military rhythm that isn't much like fun. But in a disquietingly cerebral way the music is very moving, with the Kinman brothers' wide-spaced close harmonies adding a unique sweet-and-sour lift to their defiantly doomy tunes. At a moment when the word ""rain"" has become rockese for all human suffering, I can't help but like folks with enough sense to pay attention to the way it falls.

Country girl Marlanna Evans only got into hip-hop at North Carolina State, and 2017 Grammy nominations or no 2017 Grammy nominations she'll never be a promising young rapper again. Not only is she 35, she's too sane, too civilized, too deep into deep-soul beats every bit as Southern as their trap antitheses. Yet on this artistic breakthrough her ""real life rap"" matches her conversational, comprehensible, musically modest flow to content that's anything but regional. Rhyming her diary and mulling her cultural tribulations, she represents for young black working women everywhere. Would they all were so quick-lipped. Would they all had enough money.

With headman Luke Jenner flaunting his tortured-romance shtick--a clarion Ian Curtis-Robert Smith hybrid only not really depressed, because he gets off on pretending to be--this is mannerist DOR more accomplished and less sentimental than its sources. Title tune flows out of great hit so naturally you hardly notice the segue, and dig the synthesized train horn that adjoins the saxophone noises on ""I Need Your Love."" I wish they'd make a pass at Killing Joke's ""Change"" or Medium Medium's ""Hungry So Angry."" But more likely Jenner is on the hunt for a hit ballad even as I write.

Three years of artistic posturing, musical effort and spilled ink went into a rhythm trifle less consistent and commercial than the debut. But the capital expenditures aren't our problem, and the artifact's high spots bury, for instance, the two Danger Mouse tracks.

Lifelong Rastafarian Michael Henry does Jah's work by reclaiming pop music for the folk, slipping a line from Wilson Pickett here and Bob Marley there into hymns and chants whose elemental melodies invoke the most high on rivers of funde drums. Not that the beat is more sinuous than mainstream reggae. If anything it's more direct--Michael is a primitivist's primitivist, and thus he overpowers reggae's all-sounds-the-same dilemma.

I don't quite believe it myself, but this really does it--brings the middle '60s into the middle '70s. Full of great singles for a singular time, which obviously doesn't mean this one. Two secrets. First, Scott McCarl is the big bad John they've always needed to complement Eric Carmen's supersweet Paul. Second, a vague concept (just like Sgt. Pepper!) adds dimension to several otherwise minor tracks. Highlights: ""All Through the Night"" (Eric as Rod the Mod), ""Hands on You"" (drumless John-and-Paul takeout), and ""Overnight Sensation"" (about being in it for hit records rather than money, which is what I call a concept).

Packaged with dozens of reprints and newly commissioned pieces, several of which promulgate the absurd saw that they were as good ""musically"" as the you-know-who--as if they ever came close to the Beatles' delicacy or insane enthusiasm or melodic inspiration--this is an Eric Carmen showcase, just like it says. Carmen's taste for mawk is documented revoltingly on his solo debut, but on this compilation it finds only one outlet, the eight-minute ""I Can Remember."" Otherwise, here are all his good tunes with none of Wally Bryson's or Scott McCarl's, reminding me that the silly love songs I love the most tell me something more about the artist than that he or she loves silly love songs.

The Ramones' conceptual smarts earned them an aura of significance even when they made like sellouts. The Rattlers are neater--sharp formally and technically, terse and tuff. The KKK didn't take their baby away, just some radioactive mutant, and they cover ""I'm in Love With My Walls"" as if Lester Bangs wrote it just for them, which he half did.

Near as I can tell, the main thing country-rock does for Jimmy Podrasky is let him sing his songs in a drawl. The drawl doesn't pass--when it comes to Appalachia, Podrasky's native Pittsburgh is close but no corncob pipe. The songs, however, are pretty hip, a credit to Podrasky's lit-major fondness for Dylan and Twain. This being country-rock, they generally take a chugging freight-train rhythm.

Manhandling all the instruments on 15 songs in 30 minutes, he bashes out a sloppy Ramones homage that gets the New Yorkers' tune-smart momentum without finding much comedy in ""My family they never knew"" or ""See you in the park/See you doing well."" As the Ramones discovered and Jay came in knowing, this trick is harder than scoffers will ever understand, and there's no reason to think he'll ever try it again.

Produced by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's John McEuen, and for once that's a good thing. Where on Allen Ginsberg's weird old Blake album a tuneless hippie chorale rendered Blake's lyrics over finger cymbal, flute, and harmonium that cried out for a round of oms, Afro-Cherokee Redbone claims Blake for British balladry, where he belongs. Traditional lyrics are worth marveling and puzzling over. But I know of few as powerful and strange as ""The Garden of Love,"" ""I Rose Up at Dawn of Day,"" or ""The Fly,"" to name three that went unannotated when I marked up my complete Blake at 19. Blake is always less obscure in Songs of Innocence and Experience mode, and between Redbone's lucid, subtle force and the modernized Appalachian settings she fits to the poet's stanzas, she's created a new body of folk song by a lyricist who compares favorably to, well, Bob Dylan. Not every track takes it home. Nothing is that automatic. But a major find nonetheless.

Lenin in the Style of Jackson Pollock""--""They say it's art killed Pollock/As if that could be/In fact he missed a bend/And drove his Ford into a tree""--but he'd approve of the triumphant pseudo-operatic warble with which Lora Logic stretches out that last word (and no, Berger doesn't like the Essential Logic album either). Also instructive are ""The Milkmaid"" and ""The Tractor Driver,"" twin parodies of capitalist idealism and socialist realism. And the Au Pairs and the Gang of Four are directed to the side-closers, both of which are dubious about romantic love and one of which is entitled ""The Principles of Party Organization.""

But while at the time I admired Redding (""the love crowd"" pegged that audience perfectly) and was appalled by Hendrix (""a psychedelic Uncle Tom,"" I called him, and that's one of the dozens of things he was), in retrospect they seem equally audacious and equally wonderful. As evocative a distillation of the hippie moment in all its hope and contradiction as you'll ever hear.

FALSE,A-,King & Queen,Otis Redding & Carla Thomas,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10996,"
I used to think Live in Europe, also a 1967 release, was Otis's finest; now I think it's among his worst, and for the same reason--too many concessions to an English audience that wanted fast rock and roll songs. My own personal favorite--probably among my five most-played LPs--is The Immortal Otis Redding, which showcases the unduplicated warmth, tenderness, and humor of his ballad singing. By contrast, this one--cut basically as a novelty, with the two singers in the studio, according to the story, on separate days--is pretty ephemeral. Vintage Otis, that's all; Carla Thomas was never anything special, but with Redding counterposing his rhythms, she sounds like she could scat with Satch himself (well, almost). Enormously vivacious, catchier and funnier that most soul music, and I know several people who would kill me if I didn't include it.

FALSE,A-,Helen Reddy,Helen Reddy,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1516,"
Reddy just sings words and melody instead of dramatizing them. She prefers songs to musical doggerel (a special weakness of Judy's) and hints at jazz intonation and timing rather than trying to sound pristine (like Joanie). Although she still sounds a little awkward rocking out, the forceful, uncluttered arrangements here recapitulate the virtues of her vocal attack, and the lyrics are intelligent and outspoken. Including: a scathing death-of-a-cocksman song that Carole King somehow left off Music, a John Lennon autotherapy that sounds inquisitive instead of foolish, and a frolicsome sisterhood ditty that she wrote herself.
"
FALSE,A-,Doc's Da Name 2000,Redman,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2913,"
Redman's brand of weed-fueled raunch-ruckus has never been as wild or ecstatic as Busta Rhymes's or Ol' Dirty Bastard's, but here he fuses their comic high spirits with his own trademark grit into ground-level, politically incorrect satire full of loud farts, stinkin' asses, and no-account thugs making monkey noises. In a genre where nobody wants to be a role model and everybody is, Redman cuts fresh cheese: ""I'm a everyday nigga like a Toyota/The A&amp;R hope we don't drop the same coda."" People have jobs on this record--""whether it's fast food, or transportation, sneaker store, doin' hair, or straight-up strippin', we gotta get the cash""--and that includes a ""round-the-clock lyricist"" who claims to sleep in his workboots. Not everybody can go to work, though. So give the last word to babymama militant Liquidacia, whose demands include 40 cans of Enfamil a month and no reporting babydaddies to welfare: ""We must stick together in order to survive in a world of bourgie hos.""

FALSE,A-,Let's Go!,The Reducers,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3816,"
Suspiciously generic though they may seem, nobody can name the genre--the attack of speed boys like the Vibrators yoked to a Stonesish but very American ""honky imitation of the blues."" You know, rock and roll like you dream about it. Their cross-class sniping isn't as sharp as their what-the-fuck-are-we-doing-in-New-London? because no matter how you strip them down and speed them up, blues and country sources still put a premium on personal expressiveness. Thus the Reducers' satire is straightforward rather than deadpan, their anger their own. For cartoony affectlessness they substitute contained, rapid-fire soul; for chordal roar, licks and even quick, clipped, vaguely Claptonesque solos; for ur-pop hooks, a honky imitation of the blues.

FALSE,A-,Rock n Roll Animal,Lou Reed,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2141,"
At its best, Reed's live music brings the Velvets into the arena in a clean redefinition of heavy, thrilling without threatening to stupefy. ""Lady Day,"" the slow one here, would pass for uptempo at many concerts, the made-in-Detroit guitars of Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner mesh naturally with the unnatural rhythms, and Reed shouts with no sacrifice of wit. I could do without Hunter's showboating ""Introduction,"" and I've always had my reservations about ""Heroin,"" but this is a live album with a reason for living.

FALSE,A-,Walk on the Wild Side: The Best of Lou Reed,Lou Reed,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7621,"
Released to coincide with another label's publicity push for the new boy, this compilation may evince bad faith, but with (cocompiler) Lou that's part of the artistic statement. In fact, except for an intrusion from Berlin side one epitomizes what I now think of as his ""New York conversation"" phase--those casual, tuneless, bitchy/ironic/tender monologues endemic to Manhattan. And while side two is less coherent, moving from live Velvets remakes to another New York conversation to a deserving b/w to the surprising sweetness of ""Coney Island Baby,"" it's as good cut for cut as any side Lou's released on RCA.
"
FALSE,A-,New York,Lou Reed,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2154,"
Protesting, elegizing, carping, waxing sarcastic, forcing jokes, stating facts, garbling what he just read in the Times, free-associating to doomsday, Lou carries on a New York conversation--all that's missing is a disquisition on real estate. I don't always find his politics especially smart--though I have no problem with his grousing about Jesse's Jewish problem, I wish he'd called the man on Hymietown rather than Arafat. But that's not really the point, is it? As usual, the pleasure of the lyrics is mostly tone and delivery--plus the impulse they validate, their affirmation that you can write songs about this stuff. Plus, right, the music. Which is, right, the most Velvets of his entire solo career. And which doesn't, wrong, sound like the Velvets. Not even as much as Galaxie 500. Just bass, drums, and two (simple) guitars.

FALSE,A-,Set the Twilight Reeling,Lou Reed,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2157,"
Ever since Sally Can't Dance, if not ""The Ostrich,"" Reed has been writing stupid-sounding songs that outrage his intellectual fans and probably his stoner fans too. On his best album in over a decade, including three consecutive ""serious"" ones, these include the backward-looking ""Egg Cream"" (only a self-hater could resist that hook) and the silly-sexy ""HookyWooky"" (""Reed Reveals: Fucking Is Fun!"") and even the defensively macho-cynical ""NYC Man"" (asshole's confession as asshole's boast). Hooray for Laurie Anderson, either for distracting him from his various higher callings or for urging him to be himself. In a related development, he rocks out on guitar.
"
FALSE,A-,Songs for Drella,Lou Reed/John Cale,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2155,"
Lousy background music--absorb it over three or four plays, then read along once and file it away like a good novel. But like the novel it will repay your attention in six months, or 10 years. The music's dry because it serves words that make an argument worth hearing: Andy Warhol was a hard-working genius--a great artist, if you will--betrayed by hangers-on who no matter what carping philistines say gave a lot less to him than he did to them. Villain: Valerie Solanas, whose attempted assassination broke his generous spirit and turned him into ""Society Andy."" Inspirational Verse: ""You might think I'm frivolous, uncaring and cold/You might think I'm frivolous--depends on your point of view.""

FALSE,A-,Music for 18 Musicians,Steve Reich,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7624,"
In which pulsing modules of high-register acoustic sound--the ensemble comprises violin, cello, clarinet, piano, marimbas, xylophone, metallophone, and women's voices--evolve harmonically toward themselves. Very mathematical, yet also very, well, organic--the duration of particular note-pulses is determined by the natural breath rhythms of the musicians--this sounds great in the evening near the sea. I find it uplifting at best, calming at normal, and Muzaky at worst, but as a rock and roller I often get off on repetitions that drive other people crazy. Usually, I should add, these people tend to be nervous anyway.
"
FALSE,A-,Radio Rewrite,Steve Reich,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16262,"
Although I admire Reich in general and love Music for 18 Musicians in particular, he does dig him some austere, and austere I can live without. But here Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood performs one of Reich's more virtuosic pieces and Reich returns the favor by assigning minimalist variations on some cunningly concealed Radiohead themes to the alert experimentalists Alarm Will Sound. Right, no one would call it a party. But the rock sonorities are very much a comfort nonetheless. So I expect to get my secondary Reich fix here from now on. And while sticking with Kid A, I'll probably get my secondary Radiohead fix here too. In prog of any vintage or cultural orientation, minimalist rigor rocks.
"
FALSE,A-,Django Reinhardt,Django Reinhardt,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11702,"
The label is per the late, lamented CDNow, which listed this 66th of 68 Reinhardt albums for $8.49; the copy I bought my wife for Christmas a few years ago says Koch Prï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sent. It has a purple-and-green cover, track listings indicating years, times, and composers but not personnel, and liner notes comprising two blank squares of paper. So it goes with the Roma guitarist, whose discography is as impenetrable as any in jazz. Take for instance Bluebird's high-profile 2002 Djangology, which proves a warmed-up remaster of Bluebird's 1990 Djangology 49 in different order with prettier packaging for a few dollars more. The '49 session reunites the classic Quintet of the Hot Club of France, which means mainly violinist Stephane Grappelli, who as a Chuck and Jimi fan I like as much as the eclectic three-fingered melody master. Probably because he was getting ole, with anonymous vocalists and obstreperous big bands intruding only occasionally. More important, this CD is hot--hotter than two 2001 releases also at hand, Naxos Jazz's Vol. 2 and Music Club's Swing Jazz. Blistering, in fact--what pace. He ""swings,"" all right--like Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie.
"
FALSE,A-,Chronic Town,R.E.M.,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2914,"
This headlong tumble proves them the wittiest and most joyful of the postgarage sound-over-sense bands, probably because they make so little sense that their sound has to be articulate indeed. Physically incomprehensible lyrics make them harder to parse than somebody else's mystical experience, but every so often a chaotic undertow suggests there's more to their romanticism than Spanish moss.
"
FALSE,A-,Murmur,R.E.M.,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2915,"
They aren't a pop band or even an art-pop band--they're an art band, nothing less or more, and a damn smart one. If they weren't so smart they wouldn't be so emotional; in fact, if they weren't so smart no one would mistake them for a pop band. By obscuring their lyrics so artfully they insist that their (""pop"") music is good for meaning as well as pleasure, but I guarantee that when they start enunciating--an almost inevitable move if they stick around--the lyrics will still be obscure. That's because their meaning and their emotion almost certainly describe the waking dream that captivates so many art and pop bands. Which leaves me wondering just how much their pleasure means. Quite a lot, I think.

FALSE,A-,Eponymous,R.E.M.,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2921,"
Though the cruder original ""Radio Free Europe"" and clearer original ""Gardening at Night"" obscure the evolution slightly, you can hear them change. At first, with Peter Buck pouring out cunning hooks and sweet rondels, Bill Berry locomotivating past any hint of wimp, Mike Mills forthrightly tuneful, and Michael Stipe moaning and mumbling and emoting as if he knows exactly what he's singing about, rock and roll is all they need--it's poetry, it's energy, its beauty, it's meaning enow. Yet only as they decide that maybe rock and roll isn't enough after all does their music embrace the brains and muscle of the real thing. Divided into ""early"" and ""late"" sides that acknowledge this dichotomy, with a train song from their fuzziest regular-release album kicking off side two, this compilation does nicely by the lyricism and depends too heavily on Document for the rock and roll, but their longstanding avant-singles commitment justifies the package.
"
FALSE,A-,Monster,R.E.M.,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2925,"
Sick of dummies claiming they can't rock, the old Zepheads deliver the first power-riff album of their highly lyrical career. Peter Buck's sonic palette is rainbow grunge--variegated dirt and distortion as casual rhetoric--and he's so cranked even the slow ones seem born to be loud. As for Mr. Stipe, he's in the band, where he belongs. Message: guitars. Which after years of politics and sensitivity is well-timed.

FALSE,A-,New Adventures in Hi-Fi,R.E.M.,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2926,"
Two years of road adventures, such as they were, that fuse spontaneity and arena scale. At sound checks and ad hoc local studios, Michael Stipe preaches and exhorts more than he rambles or muses, Mike Mills spelunks with keybs, and Peter Buck pumps the folk-rock jangle that broadened Amerindie's first wave. Nothing epochal, and there's poetry in that--the poetry of a nominal community that has learned how to keep its dreams modest and enjoy them that way. But for all the reliable melodies, momenta, and FX--love the siren on ""Leave,"" guys--there's also routine in it.

FALSE,A-,Stink,The Replacements,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3818,"
They're young and they're snotty. They think fast and short but play it too loose for hardcore. And they make getting pissed off sound both funny and fun, which is always the idea. Tunes emerge from the locomotion, sometimes attached to titles like ""Fuck School,"" ""God Damn Job,"" ""White and Lazy,"" and ""Dope Smokin' Moron,"" sometimes not--usually it doesn't matter all that much. They even have their lyrical moments.
"
FALSE,A-,Tim,The Replacements,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3821,"
No songwriter in memory matches Paul Westerberg's artful artlessness, the impression he creates of plumbing his heart as he goes along. Statements like ""Hold My Life"" and ""Bastards of Young"" are pretty grand when you think about it, but you don't notice in the offhand context of the tastelessly amorous ""Kiss Me on the Bus"" or the tastelessly resentful ""Waitress in the Sky."" So far Westerberg hasn't been touched by the pretension and mere craft that seem to be inevitable side effects of such a gift, and I see no reason to anticipate that he will be. With a band this there, presence is all.
"
FALSE,A-,Pleased to Meet Me,The Replacements,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3822,"
It's no different for Paul Westerberg than for less talented mortals--sooner or later he had to grow up or fall apart. That's why he got rid of Bob Stinson, who threatened to destroy the band along with himself and anybody else within range. But that doesn't mean Westerberg's guitar can extend Stinson's perpetually broken promise to harness the power of naked anarchy. Or that he can altogether avoid the sentimentality inherent in subjects like teen suicide and red red wine. Of course, with almost any other band those two songs would be airplay cuts, but compared to ""I.O.U.,"" ""Alex Chilton,"" ""I Don't Know,"" ""Valentine,"" they're product and filler. For the third straight album Westerberg delivers the goods--grimy, uplifting, in the tradition and shocking like new. No competing rock and roll mortal can make such a claim. If by some stroke he learns to handle maturity, Valhalla awaits him.

FALSE,A-,All for Nothing/Nothing for All,The Replacements,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3825,"
I never bought the theory that Warners tamed them--life generally has that effect anyway. But the all-for-nothing disc's selection from the slide made inevitable by Let It Be, which stands beside Wild Gift as Amerindie's very peak, short-changes the wild (""I Won't"") and the tasteless (""Waitress in the Sky""); you'd be better off with Tim. The miscellaneous arcana on the nothing-for-all disc, however, are pretty unkempt for a pop band in the process of mastering its craft as it loses its purpose--a blues, a lo-fi proposition, a Disney cover, B sides, what-all. In fact, although or because it's a mess, it's got more pizzazz than either of their two final albums. No ""Aching to Be,"" that's for sure.

First Elizabeth Elmore left a great band to go to law school. Now she leaves a great law school to start a better band, bringing a dark, intense fury to Sarge's runaway jangle. You'd think she'd be proud of herself, and from the way she talks you can tell she is. But is she happy about her accomplishments? Au contraire. Friends and lovers fall away on all sides, so that she would leave this town tonight if she could think where to go--not law school, damn it. One begins to wonder whether beneath her reasonable exterior lurk impossible demands. After all, when guys spend albums complaining about how nobody's good enough for them we figure they're trying to kid somebody. She goes out covering Elvis Costello, who is not my choice to replace Ann Landers.

Not a nice girl, Elizabeth Elmore.  Not a girl at all--very much a woman, a driven one. Unsparing of her own faults, which she describes with acuity and sets to tunes that make them sound normal in an attractive way. If she betrays an artistic flaw as her second band grows, it's that her accomplished singing doesn't quite deliver her excellent lyrics. Maybe deep down she wants to reveal herself yet not reveal herself.  In any case, love is a problem, and she's no longer claiming it's the guy's fault--except for the one who hits her (she got that right) and a boyfriend's buddy who won't come through on his come-on (she got that wrong and half knows it). A true rock miniaturist, loyal to her friends and in need of a week's sleep.

Organized by a Mennonite conscientious objector and fronted by an omniverous pop showman, this was the one American garage band whose recorded output justified the ensuing mythos. Where here-and-gone hitmakers like the Standells and the Count Five were never as good as their best songs, and wild Northwest rivals like the Sonics and the Wailers never even had best songs, these guys sunk their chops into professional smashes (""Hungry,"" ""Kicks"") until they figured out how to write them (""Ups and Downs,"" ""Him or Me--What's It Gonna Be""). And long before that, they figured out how to rock out, beating the Kingsmen to ""Louie Louie"" and daring the previously unreleasable frat-orgy classic ""Crisco Party/Walking the Dog."" Eventually, they also figured out how to wimp out. But unlike their vinyl best-of, this CD is programmed to cut out first.

Word-slinging about day-to-day struggle and bullets gone astray, he either knows whereof he speaks or hires good researchers, and his beats lively his facts just right--only things that sound faux are the street tracks in the middle, one posse and two sex.

Less enchanting than the first one, in part because it's not a surprise and in part because the tunes are a touch duller and the playing is a touch broader. But the idea of subjecting presalsa to the affectionate indignities of a small, bent jazz ensemble remains muy divertido. And once you internalize the material--by Ribot's beloved Arsenio Rodriguez and several other Cubans, with Ribot's own ""Las Lomas de New Jersey"" and ""Baile Baile Baile"" holding their own--you'll love the vamp-ups, the is-that-a-jokes, the getting loud but not that loud.

I never took Charlie's could-been-Elvis rep very seriously until I heard the passionately confident Jimmy Reed medley that opens side two of this Nashville album. What's missing is Elvis's insolent verve--Rich is sometimes soulful to a fault, veering dangerously toward mere sincerity, a clue to his Nashville success. But there's a payback in maturity and attention to musical detail. No more blues, except for a redefinitive ""Since I Met You Baby,"" and no rock or rockabilly. But he manages to render a piece of countrypolitan mawk like ""A Picture of You"" at least interesting by sheer belief, and the way he sings his wife Margaret's ""Life's Little Ups and Downs"" makes you know what they mean by ""'til death do us part.""

I know ""saddest album ever made"" isn't much of a sell line, especially from a judge who may never fully penetrate the rest of the forlorn catalogue of Willy Vlautin's signature band. But I guarantee that this one's so well put together it'll lure you to play it over and over. Pretty impressive how tentative hopes like ""At least for a while we are out of state/Out of that state"" and ""And if it's somewhere, somewhere near/Well at least it's not here"" are dragged down by vocals that fend off depression line by line, how the instrumental ""Patty's Retreat"" disintegrates into a chaos guaranteed to drive Americana sentimentalists back into their history-at-a-distance. And ""Five Degrees Below Zero,"" when Ray Thaves stops the bus in the middle of the desert night and walks in the opposite direction from the Vegas lights without even a coat on, is a suicide you can get with.

What's most original about Rigby isn't her analysis of the men who fail to provide the kind of love she demands so sanely and evokes so hotly. Nor is it her designated theme, age, although I wonder how many 23-year-olds will learn as much about fun from ""The Summer of My Wasted Youth"" as she wants them to. It's class, which she's old enough to understand for the simple reason that she doesn't have enough money--not the way the executive mom who covets a bigger co-op doesn't have enough money, the way the temp mom who buys back-to-school outfits at Goodwill doesn't have enough money. Her voice as real as Roxanne Shantï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½""All I Want"" if not ""What I Need.""

I know Rigby just well enough to worry whether her songs are worth what they cost her in frustration and heartache. But I admire the nakedness of her singing and writing enough to believe I'd feel the same even if mutual friends hadn't engineered a child chair exchange for us back when she was married. Now pursuing fortune and fame in Nashville like many lesser NYC songwriters before her, she shows no signs of turning into Janis Ian, and sexual preference has nothing to do with it--except insofar as men are dicks, of course. She has perspective on her lack of funds, her healthy sexual appetite, her susceptibility to ladies-love-outlaws syndrome, and her self-knowledge itself. Rode hard and put away wet, she's funny about it--""Cynically Yours"" is made for an Alt-AC format that will never exist. And she's also touching about it, which is the hard part.

Much as I love her songs, with this her best batch since her first, I love her singing them more. The way she starts the album by calmly drawling ""I'm tired of bein' tired of bein'/Why am I always disagreein'"" over murmured accordion and tick-tock percussion is so sturdy and so musical that it still catches me short. Outspokenly ordinary, she's hard on her man, hard on herself, hard on her life, which like most American lives is fairly hard. Although her romantic ups and downs aren't the disaster she believes sometimes, she really would like to know if she's ""ever gonna have sex again."" Answer--definitely. She's attractive if by some juvenile standards mature, and she feels the love in her and the lust in her at the same time, which always helps. If only the millions of women in her situation had the time and funds to test-drive alt-country CDs, she'd be as famous as Lucinda.

Between 1996 and 2005, the 37-to-46-year-old ex-wife of excellent drummer Will Rigby released five excellent-to-superb pre-Americana CDs stocked with more terrific songs than any competing non-rapper except maybe Jon Langford--including Bob Dylan on his last great run, although I'll give you Sleater-Kinney while noting that songs per se aren't really what they do. Concrete, class-conscious, cutting, forlorn or funny or both, Rigby's lyrics chronicled a single mom's quest for love and sex, so of course they were never taken as seriously as ""Cold Irons Bound."" Only then she hooked up with Wreckless Eric, who's ridden ""Whole Wide World"" for four otherwise marginal decades, in a marriage so engrossing her writing slowed down to two hers-and-his albums. So now comes her first solo work since her great run, with Eric's production lending an unmannerly distorto gravitas that suits its audacity. If you don't want to hear a 58-year-old female singer-songwriter litcrits have never heard of impersonating Philip Roth emailing Bob Dylan about his Nobel, you probably think she's on Dylan's side, and you're wrong. Robert Altman also gets a song, as does an unnamed sack of shit she resists in her mind by imagining she's Tony Soprano, Lucky Thompson, or Walter White--the NAACP one not the Breaking Bad one, as Wikipedia helped me figure out, after which I looked up the unbowed Thompson and recalled that Soprano had a specialty in assassinations.

The onetime dB drummer also plays keybs as he sings over his guitar buddies in a quavery drawl that knows the difference between funny-eccentric and eccentric-affected; his changeable band clangs and twangs, more Big Pink than dB's or Amy. He also knows the difference between a solid tune and a generic one. And he writes lyrics too. Sometimes they're as simply nutty as "". . . Wheelchair, Drunk,"" but usually they're also pointed--at Dylan worship, the eschatology of Ricky Skaggs, ""The Jerks at Work."" Many others bemoan his romantic ineptitude--often humorously, anything but on the come-back-darling ""The Sweeter Thing to Do."" I doubt it's about Amy. But I haven't researched the question and would just as soon not. Too painful.

FALSE,A-,Talk That Talk (Deluxe Edition),Rihanna,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15546,"
Musically, this is pop without shame--her hookiest and most dance-targeted album, decorated with a thoughtful assortment of suitably titillating blats, noodles, dubs, groans, hiccups, boom-booms, cut-ups, speed-ups, xx samples, and spoken-word bits. Lyrically, it celebrates the relationship of sex to love rather than pain, dipping predictably on the heart songs and theme statements that slow down the second half, especially on the standard edition. Associating carnality with love as I do, I prefer it to her earlier albums because I find its many porny moments titillating.

FALSE,A-,Foreign Ororo,Riton & Kah-Lo,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17390,"
Riton is London 40-year-old Henry Smithson, who's been riding the waves of the UK dance scene since 2001, Kah-Lo Nigerian 25-year-old Feridah Seriki, who moved to New York in 2009 to attend college and stayed to pursue a job in marketing. Their delectable 2016 ""Rinse and Repeat"" nabbed a Grammy dance track nomination and ultimately generated this irresistible little album. The light, catchy loops and beats of the dance-pop Riton goes for take their lead from the girlish delight of Kah-Lo's half-spoken unrap in a synthesis that bears only a peripheral relationship to Lagos's electro-happy Afrobeats craze. Kah-Lo's saucy vocal signature is as calculated an invention as the besotted pitch corrections of Rayce or Mr Eazi, but her presumption of innocence is as old as rock and roll, manifesting in an evolved schoolyard chant that needs a fake ID to get loose with the Henney and the Coke. Notice, however, that ID quality becomes a much heavier matter in the Mr Eazi cameo ""Immigration."" And that ""Money"" is about not really needing that much.

FALSE,A-,A Better Destiny,Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11550,"
You bet I A-shelved The Rough Guide to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Music Club's Ecstasy even better. Nevertheless, my basic attitude toward the prolific late great is enough already: We atheists need only so much Allah, and a little marginal differentiation helps the Sufism go down. I didn't notice the first two albums by this group, led by two more of Nusrat's numberless nephews, and I might like the first, by the label's account ""traditional"" rather than the ""hypnotic fusion"" of the Count Dubulah-aided follow-up. But when I grabbed this one blind, I had a reconversion experience. Even by qawwali standards Rizwan and Muazzam have big voices--rival nephew Rahat is distressingly reedy by comparison. They're at once more forceful and more eccentric than fraternal competitors the Sabri Brothers. And they're also lively, leaping higher and crazier than nephew Basrat on his latest speed-qawwali venture, the imaginatively titled Lost in Qawwali III.

FALSE,A-,Sacred 78's,Roaring Lion,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2959,"
Lion (a/k/a Hubert Raphael Charles, Raphael De Leon) was the most recorded Trinidadian of the pre-World War II era, and title notwithstanding, this selection of classics (plus a few '50s pleasantries) has nothing to do with praising the Lord--or no matter how happily he tapped into Shango ritual, the orishas either. Even more than most calypsonians, Lion played the secular sophisticate, cultivating foreigners, intellectuals, Atilla the Hun, Rudy Vallee. Because he took pride in not repeating himself, he deployed more tunes than the competition, and if some of his arrangements are almost pop, ""Rhumba Dance"" amd ""Bamsee Lambay"" are almost Latin tinge. Subjects include flies, Queen Elizabeth's royal tour, girls who dance with girls, a pyromaniac, agape, and sex, which the man who made ""Ugly Woman"" famous rarely if ever associates with love.

With neotraditionalism going and outlawism gone, it's an up to run into a Nashville cat with a beard, and a boon that it could stand a trim. A Detroit native gone hillbilly and proud, he savors the details pop leaches out of country--the 300-hp galmobile, the words of the hymn he gets married to, the TV set that freaks with the sewing machine on. And like the young John Anderson, he knows enough to keep things fast and/or funny whenever possible.

Most of Smokey's finest solo album is in the sexy do-the-rock mode of his biggest solo hit, ""Cruisin'."" Motown purists-come-lately will no doubt be miffed at the snappy discofication of ""Get Ready"" that opens the ""Cruisin'"" side. But what cavils will they level at the new songs on side one, which modernize the man's concise, smoldering romanticism with a zip and flair that seemed lost to him years ago? Never count a soul man out--never.

FALSE,A-,Anthology,Smokey Robinson & the Miracles,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6024,"
The hard truth that minor Miracles songs are just barely carried by the breathy faith and modest grit of Smokey's tenor is softened by the minor miracle of how diligently he nurtured the inspiration that put him on the charts at 18. Granting a few wonderful moments, this gets going midway into disc one, with 1963's ""You've Really Got a Hold on Me,"" my nomination for the best thing he ever recorded. It rolls through 1967's ""I Second That Emotion"" and then starts wandering--wandering attractively, intelligently, imaginatively, professionally, but with only ""Tears of a Clown"" (and its follow-up, the graciously sarcastic ""I Don't Blame You at All"") worthy of serious payola.

FALSE,A-,North by Northwest,Tom Robinson,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3980,"
Robinson's bonhomie is rarely seductive--he picks such stiff, strident, perhaps even rigid drummers that his records require effort or at least concentration. But this is where I stop wondering whether he's a fluke. Just about every one of these songs synthesizes his protest-oriented TRB phase with the more cryptic and personal musicality of Sector 27. And though Richard Mazda isn't the collaborator Stevie B. was, after five plays or so nearly every track sinks in deep.

FALSE,A-,The Collection 1977-87,Tom Robinson,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3982,"
First side's a seven-song Tom Robinson Band best-of more useful than 1982's full-length job, second a chronicle of his non-oi phase that omits anything from the intimate, underrated Sector 27, why I know not but convenient for anyone who can locate the thing. Fans will appreciate the U.K.-only highlights. And those who've always been put off by his tuneless sincerity will learn firsthand that gay rock and roll needn't be arch or confrontational to establish its identity.
"
FALSE,A-,Power in the Darkness,Tom Robinson Band,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3977,"
Musically this is fairly foursquare, not clever enough for good pop nor unrelenting enough for great rock, and the lyrics are pretty foursquare too, rarely suggesting that politics involves internal contradiction as well as oppression. But at the very least the package exemplifies Robinson's penchant for good works--in addition to a ten-song LP it includes a seven-song bonus record. More important, almost every one of these songs kicks in eventually, and four take no time at all: the instant hit ""2-4-6-8 Motorway,"" the proud, sardonic singalong ""Glad to Be Gay,"" a music-hall number about the rewards and ambiguities of male-to-male friendship called ""Martin,"" and ""Winter of '79,"" in which the epochal repression of that future season is recalled form some further future as a hard but (compare Davie Bowie, Black Sabbath) by no means apocalyptic piece of history.
"
FALSE,A-,TRB 2,Tom Robinson Band,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3978,"
A measure of how good Robinson is at writing his rock and roll protest songs is that you often don't remember them by title--almost every one jogs the memory with an additional catchphrase. Another is that though I know a white man is making it with a black man and I know it's more than all right, I still can't suss out the details of ""Sweet Black Angel."" A third is that I started singing ""Sweet Black Angel"" to myself the first time I played the record. And the capper is that since I saw him live every other song here has been ringing in my head as well.

I liked the title tune better when I thought he was saying ""don't let the fascists get you down"" rather than ""bastards,"" but it amounts to the same thing. Long a champion of country music that eschews both purity and virtue, here Robison writes like his life depends on it, which it does--the virtue lobby has all fun in its sights, his music included. On the one about eating his wife's cooking he finds a new shade of meaning for the word ""brisket."" And on the one about how his wife vamoosed anyway, words fail him: ""But I still got my buddies and I still got my pals/And I still got my buddies and I still got my pals.""

Initially I was disoriented by the hype for ""With Every Heartbeat,"" the nearest thing to processed gouda electro Robyn has put on the table, although ""Eclipse"" is pretty goopy too. But without that add-on, which does grow on you the way pop breakthroughs will sometimes, this 2005 EU release might never have materialized here to prepare the way for Robyn 2010, and it's not like I thought ""Konichiwa Bitches"" was a sell track even before I deciphered my favorite couplet a dozen plays in: ""Come in with the postman like I'm a mail bomb/Comin' in your mouth make you say yum-yum."" Also before I realized that the slow one tucked away at the end is also the most political song she's recorded, and it's got competition. It posits Clubland as a safe haven for life's unfortunates be they good, bad, or ugly. Yum yum.

FALSE,A-,Body Talk,Robyn,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15247,"
I don't hold it against her--in this musical economy, a Swedish disco dolly's gotta do what a Swedish disco dolly's gotta do. Nevertheless, the old codger in me is maddened by the sales strategy in which budget-priced half-hour June and September CDs are not quite subsumed by a full-priced December CD. Problem is, not counting remixes like the radio version of ""Dancing With Myself,"" only one of the six new songs--namely, ""Call Your Girlfriend,"" almost as discerning in its romantic decency as ""Cry When You Get Older"" on Pt. 1--matches up to anything on the first two, including ""Cry When You Get Older,"" which it omits, as it does Pt. 2's ""Criminal Intent"" and ""Include Me Out."" Beyond milking obsessive fans, the idea of rounding her out commercially with a few more love songs is fine in principle. But it doesn't play to her strength, which is mindful defiance--club escapism that knows where it's coming from both personally and politically, and that feels the humanity of normals and freaks alike. From ""Don't F***ing Tell Me What to Do"" to ""We Dance to the Beat,"" her songwriting in that vein is as strong as anybody's. Scattered across her three 2010 CDs is one great album. How I wish this was it.

The king placates soukous fashion instead of following it, and having kicked off with an electrokickdrum that's never so forward again, his third U.S.-release variety show eschews total speed trip.

Except when Franco showed him how on Omona Wapi, Tabu Ley never conquered his schlock habit Stateside. Even the 1989 best-of he recut for RealWorld sounded like cummerbunds and leisure suits. But as Kinshasa transformed itself from hellhole to charnel house, Afropop's smarmiest godfather withdrew not just to Paris but L.A. Then, with a quick new guitarist and dulcet vocal acolytes helping him exploit a nostalgia it would be cruel to deny, he rerecorded a magnificent dozen of the thousand or so songs he churned out when Zaire was young, and in the great tradition of classic Afropop, their airy grace still projects an illusion of possibility. This old hero no longer plans to conquer the world. He's just grateful he can remember how it felt to be looking ahead.

FALSE,A-,Keep on Doing,The Roches,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3830,"
This sounds so good I'm beginning to believe Robert Fripp was put on earth to produce the Roches (each of us has a place in the cosmic plan, after all). It's not just the honest depth and sweet bite of the voices that make it richer musically than the debut--the songs ring with acoustic guitar ostinatos hookier than any Byrds rip you fancy. The writing has rebounded, too, though because the narrative punch and sense of overarching purpose still lags they no longer seem like protofeminist avatars--just pros who set out to prove themselves with a good album and damn right succeeded.
"
FALSE,A-,Speak,The Roches,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3831,"
It took them 10 years to make a second record as unmediated by market anxiety as their first, and that's probably not how people who think they're too smart for their own britches will hear it. They make no special effort to curb their ""arty"" ""New York"" tendencies--that's who they are. So despite moderate tempos and a unified production style (electronic folk-rock, say), the album is beautiful but not irresistibly listenable--you have to listen to the words beneath the harmonies. Fourteen honest, intelligent songs about anxious, difficult love, and if there was any justice they'd bury the Indigo Girls. But there isn't.

I missed these guys--too smooth and insufficiently rock, I guess. That was deaf. In this distillation, Smooth's rapping rivals Rakim's, and Rock is an all-time DJ. Credited samples are few, but the music's pure rhythmic pleasure returns us to those thrilling days of yesteryear before property rights trumped art: as dense with borrowed, distressed, and performed elements as the Bomb Squad's sometimes, only flowing rather than explosive. Smooth recalls a wiser time as well: conscious not self-righteous, ghetto not thug.

FALSE,A-,Seconds of Pleasure,Rockpile,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2992,"
Though Lowe &amp; Edmunds's touring vehicle piledrives too much, if you just stand there and get run over you'll enjoy it. Aurally, Edmunds prevails: this hits the ear as a collection of good neoclassicist rock 'n' roll songs, less mindless than prog nitpickers claim and less meaningful than rock 'n' roll loyalists wish. Conceptually, Lowe gets the last word, last song first side: ""Play That Fast Thing (One More Time)"" not only sums up their limitations, it sums up their knowledge of their limitations--which will separate them forever from the run of good neoclassicist rock 'n' rollers, Dave Edmunds included.

Because the basic bass parts are Nile's and not Bernard's and the basic drum patterns Nile's and not Tony's and the basic vocals Nile's and not Alfa's, this groove is stiffer, sharper, tougher, weirder, and less pleasant than Chic's. It's also good if not better, colored with Rodgers's trenchant, voluble guitar talk and rendered meaningful by his willingness to experience lust as an unsentimental need that can turn into unsentimental love.

Since it's all, or mostly, in the groove, I can only guess at an explanation. New producer Tommy Jymi? New drummer Jimmy Bralower? Nile's hot romance with the Synclavier? Luck? Whatever, Rodgers hasn't made such a jumping record since the underrated Take It Off, or such a substantial one since the underrated Real People. Some may miss that reassuring Bernard Edwards substratum, but I'll take my rhythms rising to the top.

From the Prosthetic Cubans' percussionist comes--it's his roots--Jewish son: klezmer con salsa if not the unattainable pernil pastrami. Rodriguez doubles on trumpet, the indefatigable David Krakauer mans the clarinet, Matt Darriau plays both, Craig Taborn ripples the ivories, and what comes out is less wedding than chamber or dinner music. Because there's accordion, it often recalls another triumph of Latinized European cosmopolitanism, tango--as bent and elegant as Astor Piazzolla, and suppler. The last track is the wildest and most African and has the heartrending title ""Jerusalem Market."" Would it could be so. Would it could be so.

FALSE,A-,Black and Blue,The Rolling Stones,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3838,"
More blatantly imitative of black-music rhythms and styles than any Stones album since December's Children, and also less original (if more humorous) in the transformation, this nevertheless takes genuine risks and suggests a way out of their groove. Lots of good stuff, but the key is ""Hot Stuff,"" pure Ohio-Players-go-to-Kingston and very fine shit, and the high point ""Fool to Cry,"" their best track in four years. Diagnosis: not dead by a long shot.

FALSE,A-,Tattoo You,The Rolling Stones,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3841,"
There's no denying it, unfortunately--this is a damn good record, a great band showing off its mastery, like Muddy Waters (just as a for instance) getting it up one more once. But where Some Girls had impact as a Rolling Stones record, a major statement by artists with something to state, the satisfactions here are stylistic--harmonies, fills, momentum. And the lead singer isn't getting any less mean-spirited as he pushes forty.

FALSE,A-,Rewind (1971-1984),The Rolling Stones,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3842,"
Disinclined though I am to increase their wealth or validate what is at bottom their corporate farewell to WEA distribution, I can't deny the songwriting on this compilation. By now the Jagger-Richards book is deeper than Johnny Mercer's, Willie Dixon's, like that--the first ever lyric sheet, at one level a token of their utter loss of principle, is pure pleasure (and convinces me ""Tumbling Dice"" is forever Linda's, too). Surrounded by three of their all-time best (""Miss You,"" ""Brown Sugar,"" ""Start Me Up""), even the political profit-taking of ""Undercover (of the Night)"" accrues artistic dignity. Song for song, a stronger album than anything they released in the period, and while for concept I'll take not just the eternal Exile but the casual Some Girls, it flows and maybe coheres.

FALSE,A-,Stripped,The Rolling Stones,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6071,"
Accepting--nay, embracing--the necessity of performing as a unit, they rehearsed. Ditto his responsibilities as a member of Great Britain's ruling class, Mick enunciated--except on the sole words not reproduced in the lyric booklet (that's right, lyric booklet), which go, approximately, ""She was [n?]ifty, [sh?]ifty, she looked about 50."" And macabre though it may seem, they all went out and cut not merely another unplugged recap, but a live album that reprises their classic material and groove in an honorably autumnal spirit--an album that might tell you something a decade from now. Muddy Waters would be proud.

I'm obviously not to be trusted, since when I finally pulled out my vinyl on Dirty Work, which nobody else likes, I still loved its booming Steve Lillywhite Charlie, its studious chicken-scratch Keith, its bitterness and cynicism and spiritual desperation. On this one desperation is in remission. But despite its lack of an anthem to replace ""Start Me Up,"" it certainly beats Tattoo You or anything else going back to Exile except Some Girls. Long the weak link, Mick--come on: Keith and Charlie are gods, Ron is for sound effects, and Darryl Jones is an improvement--once again proves capable of relating on what we humans pathetically call a human scale. Not that I credit his ""vulnerability,"" but I'm touched that he cares enough to lie about it. Together with clear evidence of prolonged cooperation between or among the principals (meaning two-man songwriting and a living groove, respectively), the effort suffices to provide or simulate the mattering considered so crucial in veteran bands. It also helps that the opener really rocks. As for the anti-Bush song, duh. Next time they should vet their corporate sponsor instead.

A major album, you knew that. But my grade is for the bonus disc, which--as I'd never have guessed after those drab Exile extras--has dibs on major as well. It outstrips not just It's Only Rock 'n Roll and Goats Head Soup but Tattoo You and probably Emotional Rescue (which several advisors insist I revisit). Where the regular album is musically quirky and lyrically either risky (""Some Girls,"" ""Far Away Eyes"") or generalized (""Respectable,"" ""Beast of Burden,"" damn right ""When the Whip Comes Down""), the bonus disc is musically classic-Stones and lyrically small-scale, including NYC specifics that warm my heart. Beginning with the Stu-does-Jerry-Lee bootleg fave ""Claudine"" and ending with the atypically near-political ""Petrol Blues,"" its star player is a horny guy who just got divorced--a familiar character the classic Stones were made for. Mick's Hank Williams cover trumps Keith's Waylon Jennings cover. His Freddy Cannon cover trumps them both.

Exploiting the surprise sales spike of their 2016 Christmas album Blue &amp; Lonesome, their 2017 Christmas album purportedly revisits the band's early-'60s blues beginnings, which in fact were no such thing. Chuck Berry, who wrote six of these songs, was not a blues artist, and neither was Bo Diddley, who gets three including the previously bootleg-only ""Cops and Robbers"" playlet (theirs is fine, Bo's better). Billed ""R&amp;B"" as they started playing out in 1963, the Stones were catchier and quicker than blues, and on these 32 radio transcriptions they sound like the premier bar band of their time if not ever. Where Blue &amp; Lonesome is a sodden thing--many old rockers have recorded sharper, spunkier, wiser music--this collection proves what world-beaters they were even before they got serious about songwriting. True, the unperfected ""Satisfaction"" some hedger stuck in sounds pretty good--how could it not? But ""2120 Michigan Avenue,"" the instrumental they concocted to celebrate recording at Chess, is the closer because it oughta be.

Eat your heart out, Grover Washington (Archie Shepp) (yeah, King Curtis too). This is as rich an r&amp;b saxophone record as I know, combining repetition and invention, melodies recalled and melodies unimaginable, in proportions that define the difference between selling out and reaching out. This man says more with his tone than most musicians do with a full set of chops (which he also has, of course).

I've always felt that Rollins's Caribbean airs and easy expansiveness were well-suited to his fusionoid recording ideas of recent years, but the only album that has broken through for me is Nucleus. Even on this double-LP it's the relatively mournful standard, ""Autumn Nocturne"" and the relatively austere Donald Byrd (!) theme, ""President Hayes,"" that tempt me past the dancey magic of the title cut, a tune Rollins has been playing for 15 years. And a good thing, too--the meat of the album is sustaining if not exquisite, jazz food that anyone can digest.

FALSE,A-,A Night at the Village Vanguard,Sonny Rollins,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15375,"
This 1957 date is the Rollins virtuoso fanciers fancy: two-plus hours on the Sunday of Sputnik 2, the tenor colossus braving the harmonic void in the closest thing to free jazz a bebop saxophonist essaying Porter, Gershwin, Arlen, and his beloved Hammerstein can rev into. Backed by retro-rocketing Monk bassist Wilbur Ware and a young Elvin Jones testing his launching capacity, Rollins is charged with venturing far out from these tunes without severing the harmonic moorings normally secured by a piano. He does it again and again--but not without a certain cost in ebullience, texture, and fullness of breath. Impressive always, fun in passing, his improvisations are what avant-garde jazz is for. The drum solos are a club convention that let him idle his engines a little.

Unlike the lacklustre Reconstruction, these sweet, throbbing prophecies and jeremiads fulfill the promise of Romeo's U.S. debut. Or more likely anticipate it: the rocksteady rhythms suggest that it was cut years ago. Romeo is no innovator, though, and I think I catch a claim that Haile Selassie isn't really dead in one song, which would make it no earlier than 1975. There's a lot else to catch--Romeo remains very hooky for a Jamaican, and praise Jah for that.

For the first time, everybody's sexpot shows confidence in her own intelligence. As a result, she relates to these songs instead of just singing them. It's even possible to imagine her as a lady trucker going down on Dallas Alice--and to fault her for ignoring the metaphorical excesses of Anna McGarrigle's title lyric just so she can wrap her lungs around that sweet, decorous melody.

The Bad Brains homage ""!!!"" ends in the nick of 25 seconds, ""Quills"" is sadistic in an arty way--two more sinful episodes in a cheating-song cycle where new blood Ben Kenney's guitar takes hip hop from behind and calls the baby rock and roll. This isn't some critical metaphor. It's the plot of the tale of betrayal and recompense told by 2002's freshest roots rock track and jammingest avant rap track--the album's centerpiece, ""The Seed (2.0)."" The backstory, if there is one, you can get from the gossip industry. I'll just note that on this record Kamal's keyb hooks could pass for piano. And believe that after years of racial mythology, they've found it in their talent to put black music's long tradition of tune and structure into practice.

FALSE,A-,The Tipping Point,The Roots,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12467,"
Foolhardy though it was to saddle such an uncrucial record with a title that dares the young and the restless to bitch about how it doesn't change the world, the rest of us are free to enjoy how confidently it develops a groove. Theme-setting Sly remake leads to varied confluences of democracy and Black Thought (try the hummed and mumbled hook of ""Don't Say Nuthin'"") that swing up at the end through two attention getters certain to dismay the restless--Timbabeats, how 2003! Then, to remind us they're a hip-hop band, there's a bonus cut for their sole virtuoso--which means ?uestlove, not Kamal. They understand what they can do, and what they can't.

On The Tipping Point, Black Thought establishes his prerogatives with well-honed braggadoccio that's kinda dull anyway. Here, freed from Jimmy Iovine and told by Jay-Z to do what he wants, he recedes toward the background, an observer looking out at a black Philly that hasn't risen like he has and just ""Don't Feel Right,"" as he calls the first of three straight ominous, drum-powered, social-realist reports whose tone maintains until the J. Dilla encomium that closes. Even the summery ""Livin' in the New World"" turns out to be about the surveillance state. Not hooky enough, as it doesn't take Jimmy Iovine to figure out. Strong enough to compensate, though.

Rose isn't the first country singer from the Canadian Maritimes, although neither Hank Snow nor Anne Murray was blessed with or limited by such a crystalline soprano. But a debut that favored the folk-angelic also showed a fondness for verities like the ""Hearts Made of Stone"" piano triplets that open it, and now come five simple songs where verities prevail. ""Three Minute Love Affair"" turns a single roadhouse dance into the lovely fleeting thing it can be, and soon ""Analog"" is exemplifying the corny notion that tunes this fetching shouldn't have to coexist with newfangled annoyances like robocalls, GMOs, and the pitch correction Rose plainly doesn't need. And that the other three are plainer doesn't mean they're dull--although somebody must have beaten her to ""Looking Back on Luckenbach""'s built-in pun, I doubt anybody's done it nicer.

Good album--a lot of fast ones and a great hook. Of course, Roxy Music albums have always had hooks, but ""Street Life"" and ""Virginia Plain"" never told us as much about Roxy's less accessible music as ""Love Is the Drug,"" an equation which represents not liberation from artificial stimulants but the breakdown of both sexual and emotional abandon into ""just another high."" Very appropriate to situate the song in a singles bar, for that '70s reality is the exemplary environment for Bryan Ferry's romantic pessimism. Much of what his music has to say about such environments is fascinating, even perversely attractive--but ultimately a little off-putting, which I guess is the point.

The Royal Band aren't Baobab or Super ?toile, not Kafetzis's Gambian discovery Karantamba either. But their projected debut is intense, gorgeous, and hyperactive without rushing the climax once. With gruff mbalax shouter Secka, still in the vocal ambit of Baobab's dearly departed Laye M'Boup, balanced by high, sweet natural salsero James Gadiaga, who on this record sticks to mbalax's tamas-and-horn-stabs program, they suggest that Baobab and Super ?toile weren't just two very different great bands.

I don't trust double albums, especially when all sixteen cuts on three sides were laid down by the singer-composer-producer and all seven on the fourth by a studio pickup band. But this has the feel of a pop masterpiece, and feel counts. The many good songs span styles and subjects in a virtuoso display that runs from the evanescent ""I Saw the Light"" to a true tale of high-school grossouts called ""Piss Aaron."" And the many ordinary ones are saved by Todd's confidence and verve. The studio pickup side, for instance, gains genuine meaning from his tongue-in-cheek notes (""I drafted it into some sort of operetta, that kind of thing being very popular nowadays""). Studio games that would infuriate me on somebody else's record add context here. And his perpetual adolescence is winningly lyrical and winningly snide, though rarely at the same time.

Though a bit upwardly mobile for the highbrow-lowbrows who regard money lust and the death throes of capitalism as two sides of rap's only fit subject--D.J. Run boasted about attending St. John's, of all things--the competitive fatalism of the spare, brutal ""It's Like That""/""Sucker M.C.'s"" was unforced and dead on, and Eddie Martinez's Hendrix-Funkadelic metal on the expansive ""Rock Box"" proves that even street minimalists can love guitars. But this does more than fill in around two of the finest singles of the past couple of years. It's easily the canniest and most formally sustained rap album ever, a tour de force I trust will be studied by all manner of creative downtowners and racially enlightened Englishmen. While their heavy staccato and proud disdain for melody may prove too avant-garde for some, the style has been in the New York air long enough that you may understand it better than you think.

Where the Stones dramatized their streetness by becoming bohemians, Run-D.M.C. remain defiantly and even paradigmatically middle-class, a much tougher trick. Run-D.M.C. project less respect for women than the Stones, and less interest in them, too. They commit more lyrical gaffes. And their music is a lot further out. Without benefit of a ""Rock Box"" or ""King of Rock,"" this is their most uncompromising and compelling album, all hard beats and declaiming voices. They're proud to be black all right, but I don't think it has much to do with George Washington Carver. They're proud to be black because it means they can do this.

True, they were funny about it, and Killer Mike added some give to the hard beats by sounding preacherly even when advocating atheism. And now, three albums into what was supposed to be a one-off, public acclaim, economic security, and the historical moment have transformed them--they're funnier, hookier, and kinder as well as brainier and more political. From Mike's opening ""I hope, I hope, I hope with the highest of hopes"" to El-P's culminating ""You talk clean and bomb hospitals/I speak with the foulest mouth possible,"" they transform the Bernie love that turned Mike into an election-year player into a call for resistance. In a time when street rebellions are one inevitable response to DT's inevitable atrocities, we need somebody quoting MLK loud and clear: ""A riot is the language of the unheard.""

The design of ""Coming Together"" is simple, even minimal: Steve ben Israel reads and rereads one of Sam Melville's letters from Attica over a jazzy, repetitious vamp. Yet the result is political art as expressive and accessible as Guernica. In ben Israel's interpretation, Melville's prison years have made him both visionary and mad, and the torment of his incarceration is rendered more vivid by the nagging intensity of the music. The other side features a less inspiring political piece and a percussion composition, each likable but not compelling, but that's a cavil. ""Coming Together"" is amazing.

So as we should have figured, the hook density is down three years after The Way I See It as the former Ray Wiggins declines to provide another dozen perfect Holland-Dozier-Holland songs. In fact, the born bassist now seems obsessed with groove rather than song. More Prince than Ray Parker Jr., he plays with himself to beat the band, and makes these 10 tracks bump and pulse. And then you notice even the less pneumatic ones connecting as songs. Fearing hell or working two jobs or fixing to buy what he can't afford, Saadiq sounds something like natural.

I don't mean color-blind or race-neutral--no humanist with a brain would make that race-negative mistake. I just mean what these days is called, well, relatable. Every song on this official debut is rooted in Saba's hood and brushed if not haunted by his murdered cousin and partner John Walt--""Jesus died for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat."" But it's also haunted by the sexual stress most male rappers are too fake to admit, by the career anxieties of someone who gave up an Ivy League scholarship to pursue music like his absent father.

Although the beats have fallen off a little--Just Blaze moves up to executive producer on most tracks--the prompt follow-up to Brian Carenard's long-delayed debut is slightly less militant and, as a direct result, stronger. The best song on an album distinguished by two major conscious anthems--the well-hooked tribute to the martyrs ""Blown Away,"" and ""Rap vs Real,"" a sharp-tongued rebuke to hip hop authenticity myths that backhands Puffy on its way to gonorrhea and the IRS--nails a theme few of his fans are savvy enough to grok and no rock icon of my acquaintance has gotten near: ""Relafriendship,"" about his long-term bond to a woman he'd better not go to bed with because that'll screw up what they've got.

Although their roots in the pretechno dance movement render their pop strictly futuristic, classic English not-rock with pretensions to not being pretentious, I stuck around when the first song evoked the female fanworld and the second cut was a niece of Brian Eno's ""Sky Saw."" Add the foregrounded textures and hidden tunes of two male pop intellectuals languidly manipulating synths and samplers to Sarah Cracknell's subdued lyricism and you have an educational argument for the impressionistic pastiche that's one British pop dream.

London Conversations, I sought out a used copy of this single-disc best-of and found it good--enjoying the two tracks it lifts from 1998's Good Humor, for instance, more than the two I highlighted in my brief. Saint Etienne's problem has always been melodies and arrangements a little too unobtrusive for Sarah Cracknell's compassionate calm and unshowy smarts. Their everything-but-the-glitz disco asserts itself so subtly that only the early ""Mario's Cafe"" and the late, atypically (and of course subtly) political ""Heart Stopped in the Back of a Taxi"" look you square in the eye and say classic. Still, when Cracknell quietly announces ""I believe in Donovan over Dylan/Love over cynicism,"" you begin to wonder whether Donovan's as big a fool as you thought even though you know damn well he is.

There's even a best-of no Stateside bizzer ever touched. But they clearly regard their first proper album since 2006's Tales From Turnpike House as some kind of recapitulation or theme statement--a looking back that's warmly affectionate but too cool to melt into nostalgia. Announcing her intentions with a striking half-spoken reminiscence of a fandom that began at 10, Sarah Cracknell devotes most of these songs to the young clubbers and music lovers she was and knew. But at times you suspect her subjects and personas are older, still caught up in the same dreams. And the subject of ""Twenty Five Years"" is the time in front of her. Her male partners Bob Stanley and Peter Wiggs provide reliable disco-inflected pop or vice versa that the remixers on the optional bonus disc trick up with more wit and fidelity than we who avoid remixes sagely expect.

Not much seems to happen in these songs beyond the distinct if similar female characters' pursuit of ordinary pleasure, occasional escape, and satisfactory love.

FALSE,A-,Worotan,Oumou Sangare,1997,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2650,"
Traditional? Folkloric? Malian? ""World""? Fusion? Pop? Ignoring such petty distinctions, this sexy sister and radical queen is all these things and none. Its interlock Malian, its forward motion as imbued with possibility as the message it carries, her music has never been more confident or distinct. She's proud to be a griot, an earth mother, a modern woman, a star--an effective progressive in music as well as politics, up to and including some Pee Wee Ellis horn charts to freshen her funk. She exploits possibilities she finds in Europe and America, and she gives new possibilities back.
"
FALSE,A-,Seya,Oumou Sangare,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14629,"
In the '90s she was a self-made African queen on an unprecedented feminist mission--the titles of her albums from that decade translate to ""women,"" ""marriage today"" and ""10 kola nuts,"" which lest you wonder is or was the standard bride price in Mali's Wassoulou. Then she spent a dozen years raising a son and running multiple businesses, among them selling a Chinese car dubbed the Oum Sang for Malian consumption, such as it is. Her musical return to the world market translates simply ""joy,"" and though it's unimpeachably pro-woman, it's also as expansive in mood as a Youssou N'Dour crossover. For all its 50-plus musicians, it's less varied than Youssou, though, and that's good. Sangare drew her musical authority from the cycling rhythms of Wassoulou hunting and harvesting songs, and she remains a homegirl. Nowhere is she more rousing then revving up old-time beats on two tributes to her musical forebears: the restrained ""Djigui"" and the unrestrained ""Koroko.""
"
FALSE,A-,Santogold,Santogold,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14014,"
From a punky ska base, she comes up with a pop-dance amalgam that's edgy and friendly at the same time. An established fringe bizzer at 32, she supposedly tried to make a commercial record before finding herself in thrall to her muse and her collaborators. But from here she sounds like someone for whom it's no more provocative to begin the signature ""Creator"" shrieking like a seagull than to set ""Lights Out"" to a melody so fetching it would have been considered a sellout back when ""new wave"" meant pushing the envelope. Right now her main message is just to do all this. If enough people like it, she has the aura of someone who might push the envelope.

FALSE,A-,Good-bye Mr. Cat,Nico Saquito,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2578,"
Born in 1901, he was a master of canto popular rather than folk song--the acoustic but at least semiprofessional sons, guarachas, and guajiras that were entertaining Oriente province before Castro, Batista, Marti, San Juan Hill. He was 81 when he cut these eight oldies with a shifting cast of skilled revivalists, most auspiciously the Cuarteto Patria, who are nowhere near as sprightly and tuneful on their own A Una Coqueta (Corason). The reason is mostly the high-spirited Saquito, an exceptionally wry and flexible vocalist in what must have been some dotage. Spanish and English texts provided, so give it an 87--it's got a sweet beat, and you can read along to it.
"
FALSE,A-,The Glass Intact,Sarge,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3102,"
Roughly pop and crisply punky, this is one of the rare good albums to land tunes first these days, indubitably fresh despite its verse-chorus-verse and guitar-bass-drums. Partly it's the voice of young Elizabeth Elmore--unassuming but never retiring, thoughtful but never moony. Read the lyrics--so much happens so fast that they make a difference, and note that they're printed across the booklet, compelling you to follow word for word instead of scanning down--and you'll encounter not just a sensible girl but a born writer whose subject is love or relationships depending how you look at it. Dissecting one attraction after another, she's still trying to figure that out herself. My advice, fat chance she'll take it: male or female, maybe you should rule out people in bands, dear.
"
FALSE,A-,Distant,Sarge,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3103,"
The indie circuit's no life for a girl who's been accepted at law school and wants the kind of relationships that are wrecked by the separations her lyrics dissect. So after four years, Elizabeth Elmore broke up a band that contained no other original members, and this is their testament: three new Elmore songs that could break your heart waiting for more, three goofy covers, two sketchy closers, and a patched-together club set of six songs, five of which sound brighter on 1998's The Glass Intact. Overall, for fans and collectors, I guess--only I'm not so sure this isn't the one I'll play. My favorite moment is on the live solo-acoustic ""The First Morning,"" where dimmer doesn't mean less affecting. ""Bye guys--miss you,"" she offers after the cheers, and comes this close to sobbing, wondering how she'll do without the only relationship the road is good for.

FALSE,A-,Thawing Dawn,A. Savage,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17170,"
Ten stray titles written in the course of 10 multitasking years and shaped into a solo debut with a selection of the Texan expat's Brooklyn pals. In other words: For Parquet Courts Fans Only. But it turns out that band's de facto frontman has every right, because these tracks all share an intimate, vulnerable mood--a mood that's outgrown breakup songs and opts for faith as opposed to religion. From steel guitar some call country to the horn-drone-plus-guitar-screech that binds the eight-minute ""What Do I Do,"" its atmospheric sonics showcase subtle vocals at tempos that seldom exceed mid. Catchy, too, especially on the oompah ""Eyeballs"" and the singsong ""Thawing Dawn.""

FALSE,A-,Silk Degrees,Boz Scaggs,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=432,"
Scaggs is criticized for his detachment, but I say it's subtlety and I say thank god for it. In the past, he's sometimes bought (not to mention sold) his own lushness, but this collection is cooled by droll undercurrents--white soul with a sense of humor that isn't consumed in self-parody. Inspirational Verse: ""Gotta have a jones for this/Jones for that/This runnin' with the joneses, boy/Just ain't where it's at.""
"
FALSE,A-,A Fool to Care,Boz Scaggs,2015,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16559,"
In which the vital signs of 2013's Memphis are juiced by both his shift of symbolic locale to New Orleans and his dawning suspicion that the world is going to hell in a bank statement. For more on the latter, proceed directly to the Bonnie Raitt duet ""Hell to Pay."" He's so mad he wrote it himself. But mostly he resets forgotten gems like Al Green's ""Full of Fire,"" Huey Smith's ""High Blood Pressure,"" and Bobby Charles's long-neglected ""Small Town Talk."" The opener is ""Rich Woman,"" the same Dorothy LaBostrie curio that led Robert Plant and Alison Krause's Raising Sand. Sashaying so weathered and jaunty, not to mention so New Orleans, Boz's is better. His best album since Silk Degrees in goddamn 1976, and by a wide margin.
"
FALSE,A-,Nervous on the Road,Brinsley Schwarz,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=462,"
On Silver Pistol, such songs as ""Egypt"" and ""Unknown Number"" rendered Gram Parsons irony willfully opaque. Here Nick Lowe would seem at first to be overcompensating--the side-openers, one by his innocent accomplice Ian Gomm, are genre pieces that announce a disc of straightforward country-rock. But then you notice ""I Like It Like That"" turning into ""the place of the name,"" or hear that Lowe is ""scumbag bound."" Which prepares you for the last three songs on side one, each a pleasant country-rock genre piece, each shot through with displacement and tragedy.
"
FALSE,A-,Night Work,Scissor Sisters,2010,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15232,"
No love songs, in case you had any doubts--sex songs exclusively, which usually involve human connection and occasionally hint at provisional commitment but rarely evince anything as quotidian as affection because the quotidian is for day people. In short, Clubworld without morning-after moralizing. But not without a morning after--for an early riser like me, the definitive track is ""Running Out,"" a scarcity song more desperate than any Bruce Springsteen could write because Springsteen refuses to indulge in despair. Good for him, I agree. But unfortunately, despair is very much with us. It'll blow up before it recedes. And this music is intensely committed to escaping it.

FALSE,A-,Beautifully Human,Jill Scott,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12532,"
A smart cookie, and emotionally stable to boot (cf. Mary, Macy, etc.), a virtue you assume boring at your developmental peril. Rarely do the settings distinguish themselves, and once she tries to get her honey's attention deploying a big band when she'd have been better off with more funk lite. But a distinct voice delivering noticeable verbal content is a setting too--that's why you notice the content. Anyway, the words per se could carry ""Family Reunion,"" not to mention ""My Petition,"" which accuses a suitor of abrogating her civil liberties like some Bushie. Aimed at Scott's kind of guy, that smarts.
"
FALSE,A-,The Real Thing,Jill Scott,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13870,"
The Aretha analogy here is her weight. The front cover has her looking dusky and curvacious, spring coat over medium decolletage; on the back she's sitting on the floor all pensive with an open composition book covering her bosom. In neither does she fake skinny, and that is as it should be. At the very least, ""real thing"" means something for once. Through almost as many producers as Mary, this album has a single identity, a contour and a groove that suits its well-inhabited breakup concept. There's plenty of sex before and after, and the sex has content. I don't mean emotional content, either, though I have faith the emotion is there. In her timbre, her phrasing and the words she writes in that composition book, Scott is someone for whom sex is about physical pleasure--not athletic ability, boundary transgression, novelty or dominance and submission.

FALSE,A-,The Light of the Sun,Jill Scott,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15434,"
I agree, men are dogs. But it gets my radar in a lather when this loving, lovable woman structures her 2007 album along a break-up's narrative arc and then four years later the same thing happens twice--only the first guy leaves her with a boychild who, let's be candid, she loves more unreservedly than she has any grown man on record. For instance, Anthony Hamilton, with whom she shares the highly unconvincing ""So in Love"" duet right after a conversion experience of an opener called ""Blessed"" and right before a well-nigh womanist Eve duet. Other boons in a year when Adele has positioned herself as the queen of solemn soul: the sub-two-minute ""Quick,"" about her babydaddy's attention span, and the four-minutes-plus ""Making You Wait,"" about how she needs to find out whether he's nuts first. Also the Doug E. Fresh duet.
"
FALSE,A-,The Best of Gil Scott-Heron,Gil Scott-Heron,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1407,"
Good that he refuses to shy away from explicit revolutionary reference, but 1980's ""Third World Revolution"" would have spared us the ""hairy-armed women's liberationists"" Scott-Heron's been smearing ever since he recorded ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised"" in his angry immaturity fifteen years ago. Besides, it's catchier. From ""The Bottle"" to ""Re-Ron,"" though, this should convince doubting sympathizers that effective political art--aesthetically effective political art, I mean--isn't tantamount to avant-garde polarization. It's got a good line, and you can dance to it.
"
FALSE,A-,It's Your World,Gil Scott-Heron/Brian Jackson,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1405,"
The original version of ""The Bottle,"" a protest songpoem about people who live in glass containers, was a disco hit, and now Arista is trying to break the live version on the radio, but these efforts have been disdained by discriminating progressive programmers everywhere--after all, how serious can it be if people dance to it? I hope you know the answer. If anything proves how serious Scott-Heron has become, it's the infectious groove running through all four sides of this concert album. You've heard of selling out? This is selling in.

FALSE,A-,1980,Gil Scott-Heron/Brian Jackson,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1406,"
Having already written more good antinuke songs than the rest of MUSE put together, they add a third on their best album ever. The melodies are only functional but the rhythms are seductive and the singing is warm. And then there's the words. Subjects include compromise (necessary), ""surviving"" (cop-out), aliens (surviving), the shah (dead), the road (long), and the future (here).
"
FALSE,A-,We're New Here,Gil Scott-Heron and Jamie xx,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15561,"
The Richard Russell-produced original of the revolutionary-poet-turned-brokedown-crack-addict's first studio album in 16 years strove respectfully to put a good face on--who exactly? The ""survivor""? The ""outsider""? The ""revolutionary""? The hip-hop godfather? The colorful old black guy? Granting that the moving force was Russell, my Honorable Mention stands: ""The premise isn't 'I'm new here,' it's 'I'm not dead,' and he strains mightily to get 28 spare minutes out of it."" A year later Scott-Heron was in fact dead, and a year after that came this radical remix, which to my mind respects Scott-Heron more truthfully by chopping him to bits. This Scott-Heron is a drug fiend of considerable perversity and tremendous intelligence who's gonna be dead soon. Jamie xx hears in his last testament an irreversible disintegration that he translates into heavily sampled minimalist electro marked indelibly by Scott-Heron's weariness, arrogance, and wit. In part it's just a young man's bad dream about mortality, and of interest as such. But the snatches of Scott-Heron's voice, cracked for sure but deeper than night nonetheless, delivers it from callow generalization and foregone conclusion.
"
FALSE,A-,Nature Film,Scrawl,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3108,"
With a realism other alt vets should have the modesty to imitate, these likable journeywomen cannibalize obscure old records only their cult will ever hear and come away with six songs they figure will top most of their new ones. Having learned to sing like godmothers Grace Slick and Joan Jett, they pump up ""Charles,"" for the lucky sex partner who waits up after rehearsal, and ""11:30 (It's January),"" the saddest New Year's Eve song ever told. And thus they help you hear the new ""Don't We Always Get There,"" about the perilous drive to the next gig or orgasm.

FALSE,A-,Cupid & Psyche 85,Scritti Politti,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3111,"
Green's Gallic allusion of choice--the name of his pubbery, in fact--is ""jouissance,"" but although he's playful and verbal enough to make it his own, he falls short in the climax department. I'd suggest a less gushy conceit: esprit. The high-relief production and birdlike tunes and spry little keyb arrangements and hippety-hoppety beat and archly ethereal falsetto add up to a music of amazing lightness and wit that's saved from any hint of triviality by wordplay whose delight in its own turns is hard to resist. Usually I suspect lyricists who refuse to be clear of never having figured out what they mean, but here the puns are so clever and incessant that they become an end in themselves. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Green knows what he wants to say.

FALSE,A-,"""Wanna' Meet the Scruffs?""",The Scruffs,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3851,"
Only a sucker for rock and roll could love this record, and I am that sucker. A middle-period Beatles extrapolation in the manner of Big Star (another out-of-step Memphis power-pop group on a small, out-of-step Memphis label), it bursts with off harmonies, left hooks, and jolts of random energy. The trouble is, these serve a shamelessly and perhaps permanently post-adolescent vision of life's pain, most of which would appear to involve gurls. To which objection the rockin' formalist in me responds, ""I wanna hear `Revenge' again.""

FALSE,A-,Midnight Son,Son Seals,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3231,"
Were it not for the brash reentry of the Winterized Muddy Waters, I could wax superlative; as it is, let's call it the finest Chicago blues record recorded in Chicago (get it?) since the second Hound Dog Taylor (also on this label). Seals performs the thrillingly paradoxical trick of keeping a raw guitar style under impeccable control and sings much better than his serviceable voice would seem to permit. In other words, he really knows what he's doing, and knowing doesn't stop him from doing it to it--it helps. So vibrantly conceived that I'm not even sure I should complain about the horns.
"
FALSE,A-,Live and Burning,Son Seals,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3232,"
Seals's club work tends to be rawer than the (genuinely) ""progressive"" Midnight Son, so this product makes sense. And nice as it is that Seals composes his own material, the numerous borrowings--my favorites are from Jimmy Reed, Elmore James, and Pinetop (I think) Perkins--are a peer's prerogative.

FALSE,A-,Harmacy,Sebadoh,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3117,"
Pry the black plastic backing from the jewel box and decipher the credits on the nether side of the rear insert--a perfect metaphor for how public these coy alternastars are willing to go. Note that Lou Barlow's tuneful songs focus on his achy breaky voice, while Jason Lowenstein's rockin' ones lead with his sloppy riffs. Figure that Barlow needs Lowenstein because by itself his material would be indigestible--the indie-rock version of a peanut butter and jelly diet. But admit that Lowenstein would be a loud cipher without Barlow, who I only wish did like Ann Powers says and paraded his faults to prove his honesty. As with all self-made wimps, the hustle is more insidious--his honesty is supposed to justify his faults. It doesn't. The tunes do.
"
FALSE,A-,The Sebadoh,Sebadoh,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3118,"
Apropos of I don't know, and for whatever good it will do whomever, they remain, on this recorded evidence, as good a band as they ever were, and a better one than back when they were epitomizing indie's recondite reticence. Yes, Lou's songs are, on average, better than Jason's. But Jason's songs are, in general, a relief from Lou's, plus that's his Gang of Four intro--not gonna hear one of those from the Folk Implosion, are you? Maybe they'll say bye-bye and go home, or maybe they'll make records like this until they have grandchildren. Nobody knows, including them.
"
FALSE,A-,Total,SebastiAn,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15444,"
I like my dance music cheap and with a sense of humor, as on this debut album by a fashionable French DJ with Ed Banger connections. Imagine the not-bad Justice keeping 22 tracks under four minutes as it mixes and matches hardish club fads you lived without going back to 2005. Committed to synth squelch and chary of synth tweedle, it's basically instrumental except when transforming Mayer Hawthorne into the generic soul falsetto he was born to be and M.I.A. into the cheeky disco dolly she's too conscious to become. Even the interludes are catchy. In my favorite musical moment, it segues from switched-on baroque to a speedboat engine.
"
FALSE,A-,Orientation,Thione Seck,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13055,"
Seck is mbalax's second banana, a leather-lunged griot renowned for lyrical wisdom whose work has never translated with anything near the fluency of Youssou N'Dour's--his groove is solider, hence less explosive, and he's shorter on telling musical detail. Like N'Dour, Seck had the idea of taking his Dakar brand of Mouridist Islam to Cairo long before September 11, but he was a year longer getting it right. The arrangements are more conventional and less delicate than N'Dour's Egyptian pomo-trad, and Indian elements are added to the big Cairo-pop orchestrations and choruses. But though the big man still sounds somewhat grand and stentorian to non-Wolof ears, the novelty factor and the alien melodic input put his wisdom across--if not as ideas, at least as an idea.

This distinguishes itself from Seeger's solo Music from the True Vine by gathering famous folk into makeshift supersessions, and from the Dirt Band's Will the Circle Be Unbroken by singling out less surefire songs and musicians. Taught me that I prefer sister Peggy's mournful harmonies (""Texas Ranger"") to Maria Muldaur's dulcet ones (""Take Me Back to the Sunny South""), and Mike's acerbic baritone to brother Peter's avuncular pick-'em-up.

FALSE,A-,The Complete Bowdoin College Concert 1960,Pete Seeger,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15679,"
Aesthetically and politically, Seeger has his soft and sometimes dishonest sides. But he's a titan nonetheless, and as rock criticism's longest-running anti-folkie I'm qualified to swear that such standards as ""Good Night Irene,"" ""Wimoweh,"" ""Michael, Row the Boat Ashore,"" and the magnificent ""Bells of Rhymney"" are as much a part of the American songbook as ""White Christmas"" and ""Summertime""--which latter, as it happens, Seeger anointed at Bowdoin in 1960, one of the thousands of solo shows he played during his 17-year blacklist. There are Harry Smith picks, ""Old Dan Tucker,"" ""Big Rock Candy Mountain,"" a just-germinating ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?,"" a cutting soldiers-as-workers song called ""D-Day Dodgers,"" and not much dreck at all--luckily, Malvina Reynolds hasn't written ""Little Boxes"" yet. Impeccable yet conversational, as avuncular singing as talking, Seeger evokes the folk far more cannily than most patricians, and his beloved banjo provides exactly as much unassuming musicality as he needs. He recorded hundreds more songs. But these two discs serve his legend well.
"
FALSE,A-,Night Moves,Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=397,"
I've never had much truck with Seger's myth--he's always struck me as a worn if well-schooled rock and roll journeyman, good for one or two tracks a year. But this album is a journeyman's apotheosis. The riffs that identify each of these nine songs comprise a working lexicon of the Berry-Stones tradition, and you've heard them many times before; in fact, that may be the point, because Seger and his musicians reanimate every one with their persistence and conviction. both virtues also come across in lyrics as hard-hitting as the melodies, every one of which asserts the continuing functionality of rock and roll for ""sweet sixteens turned thirty-one."" In one of them, the singer even has his American Express card stolen by a descendant of Ronnie Hawkins's Mary Lou, if not Mary Lou herself. Worrying about your credit rating--now that's what I call rock and roll realism.

FALSE,A-,Too Much Pressure,The Selecter,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3853,"
Except for songwriter-guitarist Neol Davies, these two-toners are black, reassuring in a movement that calls up fears of folkie patronization. Lead singer's a woman, too, a refreshing piece of progress no matter how self-consciously progressive its motives. Taking a folkie risk like their confreres the Specials, they honor their undercapitalized roots by emulating the two-track sound of the cult hits they love. Fortunately, Davies has an amazing ability to recapture the ska spirit without pretending it's 1965--impossible to tell whether ""Time Hard"" or ""Too Much Pressure"" is the new one without external clues--and it saves them, just barely. Play loud.

Longer on violins this time, Rodriguez's Cuban klezmer packs less thrill, with David Krakauer and Craig Taborn missed. But it's smoother too, and with international mix-and-match feeling so crucial these days, that's educational. The pomo aesthete in us craves disruptive kicks as inoculation against an undoing world. The weary traveler will settle gratefully for some social harmony.

In which Chicago alt-rapper David Cohn, a red diaper baby on his African side, explores the conundrums of race and the hidden injuries of class. His woozy flow gathers a musicality that combines Biz Markie and Posdnuous--half wigged-out clown, half unassuming postcollegiate, neither of which Serengeti is or pretends to be. This kind of confusion is intrinsic to how he conceives hip-hop. A song called ""Negro Whimsy"" is speckled with gunshots; a song called ""T.R.I.U.M.P.H."" celebrates cabernet and Lucille's rack of lamb. Occasionally, he stumbles into the gentility he parodies. More often he blurs goofy and brilliant so organically that he's both at once.

FALSE,A-,Family & Friends,Serengeti,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15437,"
Where other rappers claim mere personas are ""characters"" (sometimes inhabiting more than one on the very same album!), Serengeti writes playlets with something like dramatis personae--not just a few slightly confused rappers, although he has several of those, but white working-class superfan Kenny, black garbage man Lee, hip-hop dilettante Derek. Over beats supplied by Yoni of Anticon rap-rockers Why?, who must envy his lyrics, and Advance Base, formerly known as Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, he raps as or about 11 different losers possibly including himself on 11 songs that last barely half an hour. These include a son shooting up with his formerly absentee dad, a bigamist who couldn't resist that 17-year-old, a privileged jerk who lost his job and started a blog, and an ultimate fighter who blows his knee out. Sure the tone is often depressive or satirical. But it's also often kind, pained, silly, unhinged, and other things. On Noticeably Negro, Serengeti asked: ""Serengeti's very ill very understated/Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?"" The answer is that the world is complicated and he damn well knows it.

A surprise comeback EP from the long-silent Grimm Teachaz crew may be for Kenny Dennis fans only, but he deserves more of them. Who knew from the likes of ""Dennehy"" that this superfan could speed-rap like on ""Flat Pop""--and also, who knows what he's saying when he does? Kenny never falters as he disses Shaquille O'Neal, goes to bat for shamed Cub fan Steve Bartman, and packs a Ruger as he smacks down a loud kid, helps a stranded motorist, and tears up his parking tickets. The beats are as basic as in classic Teachaz, only modernized with extra effects, and the rhyming remains prime: ""I'm Charles Bronson, I'm from Wisconsin/Chicken MCs call 'em Swanson/They get grilled up like a porkchop/Catch 'em on the street right in front of their bus stop.""

""The antibiotics made me hallucinate/Cops arresting patients, Arabian spiders inside my arms./And then my wife got shot/She was seeing him for a year, I had no idea."" ""Hey, can I borrow your mind?/I really need a hit, it's been a long time."" ""I wish was my name was Otto/Everybody has a dream that they'll win the Lotto."" Anticon minimalist Odd Nosdam provides all the beats Geti needs, and when your mind wanders, quite often the music alone carries you along. For good measure, other alienated acquaintances drop by and pitch in. Eleven tracks, half an hour. Is there anybody else who can do this?

Moving and comic new insights into David Cohn's most beloved character, with the skits precious and the rapping per se provided by KDz--including a bootleg tape by the younger Kenny's House of Pain answer group Tha Grimm Teachaz, which plays faintly behind a traffic stop (luckily, the officer at the window is Kenny's best friend Curtis), and the incomprehensible home recording ""Punks."" In my favorite skit, Kenny meets his lifelong protegee Ders when he's denied a cash refund on a malfunctioning no-fog shaving mirror and buys the eight-year-old a shower radio with his store credit. In my favorite rap, he celebrates wedded bliss with Jueles: ""Buddhists and Cubans fit together like a Rubik's Cube."" The narrative matters on this album, and as always, newcomers should hear Dennehy first. But Cohn is one of a kind, and he don't stop.

Fronted by a cheerfully ambitious, deeply entertaining Sudanese henna artist, wedding consultant and practitioner of traditional female perfume and vapor-bath mysteries, this is the rare live album that busts out with a life and energy its studio counterparts only suggest. Evoking both Ali Hassan Kuban funk and the shaabi shaabi of the Cairo where the former Fatma Ali Adam Uthman now makes her home and helms her business, it romps over ordinary standards of genre decorum in pursuit of the greenback euro. Crazy saxes, Nubian accordions and male singers striving to take control faithfully serve and fruitlessly vie with a desert diva who can steal the show at the launch of a shriek.

In which the Boston duo, known insofar as they're known at all for Premier-they-wish beats and metaphor-is-murder battle rhymes, lightens up on a basically satirical CD. ""Get Dumb"" sets the intellectually hyphy tone: ""Billie Holiday he's the best/That cool band Beck is touring out West,"" or, ""Bin Laden he's only bluffin'/She's on the pill so I won't catch nothin'."" Esoteric treats himself to lists, similes and sexual contretemps. 7L injects scratches and drum breaks into Middle Eastern flutes, porn loops and suspense-movie music. Indie-rap lives.

FALSE,A-,Wood / Metal / Plastic / Pattern / Rhythm / Rock,75 Dollar Bill,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16889,"
This four-track, 39-minute cassette-gone-to-heaven by young NYC experimental guitarist-multithreat Che Chen and veteran NYC weird-band drummer-percussionist Rick Brown is a strange one, and it means to be, but to someone of my peculiar interests it connected quick. The main axes are Chen's two guitars, tuned so that they generate 24 tones per octave instead of the usual 12, and a wooden box Brown found on the street and bangs for all it's worth. Although Chen denies that his brief intensive with Mauritanian master guitarist Jeiche Ould Chighaly is decisive, the thing definitely sounds somehow African even if the echoes seemed less distinct when I cued up the untethered vocals and suppler grooves of Group Inerane and Group Doueh. This purely instrumental avant-rock is more solemn, deliberate, set on its strangeness. But the way the tempo picks up two minutes into the 12.27 ""Beni Said"" is friendly enough for me, especially followed by the diddleybeat Brown lays under the de facto raveup ""Cummins Falls"" and the saxes and side percussion that thicken the 15-minute closer. Quite an up in its severe way--which is an interesting up.

Even though it reprises all 12 songs on Never Mind the Bollocks (plus five familiar outtakes and B sides) with their tempos and arrangements intact, this is that rare thing, a live album with a life of its own. Its strength is that its historical moment is so definitively over. Thus it compels us to rehear Steve Jones's immense bluesless riffs, Paul Cook's stone simple beats, and Glen Matlock melodic glue as pure sound, and to confront how John Rotten-Lydon's hilariously ill-humored gutter-prophet howl, broadened but not softened with age and a decade-plus of paid acting lessons in Public Image Ltd., defined both a new rock voice and a new rock attitude.

Seymali's wonder-of-nature, awesome-as-in-forbidding voice doesn't oblige ordinary Bombino or Khaira Arby fans to like it any more than ordinary boxing fans need appreciate the finer points of mixed martial arts. So it's good that her second album moderates that deep, accomplished sandblast a little--so subtly that no non-Mauritanian will notice without direct comparison and so skillfully that folkies manque still hoping she's Oumou Sangare will keep listening to her praise of a God they don't believe in. Ultimately, they may even notice that in addition to commanding a hell of a voice, she leads a band that rocks harder than, for instance, Bombino's.

Ishmael Butler surfaced as Digable Planets' Butterfly, briefly led the electrofunk CherryWine a decade later, and then sunk from view until the near simultaneous 2009 release of two illegibly documented alt-rap EPs--even determining Butler's involvement required investigative reporting. Lead track on the first promises both ""ideology to go"" and ""attack of the funky clones,"" but until the be-what-you-are closer, the record delivers mostly clones or at least ""clones,"" including Butler as raggamuffin and a rent-a-thug calling out such ""drug pushers"" as Osama, Bush II, and old-schooler Oliver North. Fortunately, when the funk is this deep and weird, replicas sound like singletons every time.

Rhyming dark and down over beats artier than Dilla's, the artist currently known as Palaceer Lazaro dares you to pin him down. Although the music is less peculiar than first appears, exotica guitar and group-hey-with-foghorn and looped-mbira-tunelet don't exactly shout street. Yet quietly but clearly, the rapper sticks to MC swagger, casual criminality, partying till you wild out, ""a lot of hopes and wishes and dreams in here""--plus just enough cautionary reality to keep his ideology fresh. Think of him as a locally based documentarian--a ""bright light on the dark side of town"" with a cool hand on the dimmer switch.

Play loud. I can't speak to the listening practices of the post-illbient beatmakers whose tricks Palaceer Lazaro gathers together and improves on like he's just been waiting for the go-ahead from Tricky himself. But though I wouldn't be surprised if they blasted everything at 10, I think of them as background guys best heard on de facto dinner comps like, say, Mush Filmstrip (Frame 1). Don't make that mistake on an album that improves mightily when the volume is high enough to break the beats into components so they're impossible to ignore. That way, there's no mistaking it for the aimless prog Sub Pop probably hopes gullible white youngsters lump it with. Special favorites for me are the children's-chorus loop turned mbira-and-hand-drums on ""An echo from the hosts that profess infinitum,"" the kinetic drum'n'whatever of ""yeah you,"" the faux-woodwind-lick/surrogate-maracas-electroclicks/African-etc.-outro of ""Swerve . . . the reeping of all that is worthwhile (Noir not withstanding)."" But I like them all--the beats, that is. The titles are for the gullible, and shouldn't give you the wrong idea about the rhymes even though the beats are why you'll play this. Loud.

Why are Canadian rappers so clean? OK, I guess we know--they're Canadian. Still, this second-generation Rwandan Torontan stands a major chance of being confused with the fatally bland K-Os, and that's a shame for somebody who fairly bills himself as ""Rakim--North Pole Edition."" Seems like a genuine Christian, as in ""Listening to Strange Fruit, Jeru, and Beirut/Trying to listen to Je-Sus is hard as fake boobs at times,"" and for what it's worth, I'm glad he knows how boobs feel, because it undercuts that goody-goody thing. This is especially true because I don't recall previously encountering a rap as pro-woman as the one that goes, ""I talk to women/I just can't talk for women, that's for you."" But now I'm making him sound like a goody-goody when on top of some serious political smarts he's both clever and funny: ""I don't badmouth but I quickly/Put down a cat if he bit me/Like Roy's boy Siegfried./Welcome to the big leagues, where they pitch heatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"" Yes, he nails those internal rhymes. Nobody's Rakim. But he earns the brag.

I couldn't tell you how ""profound, prolonged, and widespread"" Wahab's influence on Middle Eastern music has been, though as a singer and film star as well as Om Kalsoum's arranger, he clearly played a huge role in the secularization and Europeanization of the Koranic repertoire. This great-sounding tribute by a Palestinian Christian oud/violin virtuoso, scholar, and orchestra leader has the apposite high-middlebrow tone. But unlike so many brainy projects, it pushes my pleasure buttons as well as my duty buttons. Some people get off on Ennio Morricone. I like my soundtracks more exotic.

Vulgar, confident, full of fun, this is the Cher album Cher never made--must be that Middle Eastern blood. Christian Middle East it may be (Cher's Armenian, Shakira Lebanese), but the intensity of the vibrato is more Islamic than Iberian.

Finally, a much-delayed album is spiffed up instead of diddled around. The four songs added after it was finished lift the back end decisively: the first collab does Kid Cudi a favor, the second accepts one from Lil Wayne, and the two in Spanish come with her strongest melodies (translations, please!). Not that the rest is flat, exactly; ""She Wolf"" and ""Spy"" warble as winningly as anything on ""Oral Fixation."" But though I love her vibrato and hear the unidiomatic lilt of her English as a species of music, even I often felt in need of more. Admittedly, though, it wasn't just the extra tracks that swayed me. It was all the different ways she promised to love me. With Shakira, you figure different really means different.

In which these Soul Train-trained pretty-boy/girl teen-throbs make good every which way on the commercial breakthrough of 1979's Big Fun. Including commercially, of course--more hits than Dick Griffey could fit into a release schedule here. Hits subclassification ""soul,"" I mean--as in ""black,"" or ""r&amp;b,"" or should we just say ""race music""? Or ""not pop""? Which is pretty weird, since the album's theme song ought to be the finale, ""Pop Along Kid""--pop as in the kind of music it is, and also as in what their funk does. It pops, as in ""popping bass"" and ""finger-pop."" Griffey, who understands the marketplace far better than I, hasn't put it on his release schedule.

What they're going for is the gold. Especially when headstrong dandy Jeffrey Daniel displaces shifty houseservant Leon Sylvers III in the driver's seat, the rhythms mean to stomp out funk rumors--""Rocker,"" this finale is called, as if that should settle those nagging airplay questions once and for all. It won't, but amazingly, the damage is minimal; because their lissome interplay runs deeper than groove, this is as creamy and sensual as ever. Those with a taste for postpretentious epiphany should keep an ear out for the very pretty slow one that goes ""In the final analysis [long pause] I love you.""

FALSE,A-,Greatest Hits,Shalamar,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8354,"
Five of ten cuts began life on Three for Love, which nevertheless has better to offer--amid corporate machinations too tawdry to detail, this profit-taker goes with what went, and so ends up a little soft. On the other hand, it's silly to seek sharp edges from the Solar production signature--anonymity is its strategy. Tuneful love songs feature the warm, mildly acrid tenor of Howard Hewett and the perky, slightly insinuating soprano of Jody Watley. Say Ray Parker and Prince are rockers in disguise and call it the most consistent black pop of the postdisco era.

Shamir Bailey sings his sweet tunes in a mellow high tenor devoid of falsetto striving or pretensions to femininity. Yet he's not exactly boyish--just a gentle-sounding man flaunting and/or enjoying the irony of his intelligent club-kid anomie, with Nick Sylvester's electro matching him soft edge for soft edge. What sharpens the album is club-kid beats that are always understated and sometimes forsworn altogether but also sometimes irresistible--contextualized by intelligent lyrics that critique club-kid escapism more than they celebrate it. Overarching theme: ""Girls are sad all of the time cuz/Good guys are so hard to find/So why not go out and make a scene?""

Down below is one great rock and roll song--""Give Him a Great Big Kiss""--and lotsa melodrama, most notably the lost Debussy rip ""Past Present and Future.""

Musically, they lived and died with their producers, notably George ""Shadow"" Morton, an amateur who on a whim and a dare pared Phil Spector's wall of sound down to bass-drums-guitar. ""Remember"" and ""Leader of the Pack"" were three-minute symphonies on the strength of their arrangements rather than their orchestrations--big slow notes and two sets of streetwise sisters throwing themselves into a melodramatic morbidity worthy of Werther. This dark romanticism was without precedent in rock and roll, and the Black Sabbath hordes who took it up later never realized girls got there first. If those girls were gooey inside, especially with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich feeding them lines, that just deepened the effect--in their final smash, Morton's ""I Can Never Go Home Anymore,"" the passion they expend on a martyred ""good mom"" is as convincing as anything they ever worked up for a leather-jacketed beau ideal. Archetypes never to be duplicated, they left a dozen songs so monumental that the filler functions as landscaping.

The first artist ever to chart Stateside with a Lennon-McCartney song, Shannon is suspended forever in that boy-becomes-man moment when teen-romance tropes unload their frightening burden of existential anxiety. He achieves release with his sole trick, in which minor-key verse gives way to major-key refrain topped by a brief escape into a falsetto that never hints at the feminine. This pop-rock apotheosis he achieved precisely 11 times, which here takes us from ""Runaway"" to ""Stranger in Town."" All are also on Rhino's slightly pricier 20-song comp. But where the Rhino filler is all carbon-copy follow-ups and failed experiments, the five bonuses here vary the formula without abandoning it, most memorably on--note title--""I Wish I Wasn't Me Tonight."" Despite Nashville forays and a mysteriously forgotten 1968 concept album called The Further Adventures of Charles Westover, he never matured. When he shot himself in 1990 at 55, he was still claiming five years less, just as he had 30 years before. He left no note. Did he have to?

I'd loved everything else she'd ever done, and at first this album irritated me, but now I hear it as a self-conscious return to the street appeal of 14-year-old Lolita Goode""Roxanne's Revenge."" Even the remixed ""Wack Itt,"" heavy with the housed bass fuzz that's the record's aural signature, and ""Go On Girl,"" vocals phased and speeded over hyped congas, suit music intended to sound crude and overheard in an era of packed mixes and clean hooks. So do the casually nasty rhymes, most of which Roxanne didn't write, and almost every one of which--the exception is ""Fatal Attraction,"" a carefully plotted tale that ends with a jimmy in a pickle jar--could have been made up on the spot by the unassuming owner of the most natural voice in rap. Spunky, sexy, conversational, full of fun, with a burr turning quaver that radiates hesitation and delight, she's still in contact with her happy, lucky 14-year-old self. In other words, a true rock and roller.

As politically incorrect as the dickheads she disses, Shantï¿½ï¿½""bitches"" and ""hoes"" (and ""hookers"" and ""sluts"" and ""bull daggers"") who think they can rap--that is, every female rival you can think of, many of whom she calls out by name in the scabrous ""Big Mama."" She claims to rhyme her own, but she only had her name on three tracks last album, which was four years ago, and this one doesn't bother with writing credits. So if in her world the original is still the greatest, that world exists mostly in her own mind. The thing is, though, it also exists on her records. Because she still is the greatest--she just is. Her tone and attack and enunciation vie with Ice-T and Chuck D and Rakim. Her material is full of outrageous insults and filthy internal rhymes. And perhaps because hard is all there is where she comes from, her tough, jazz-tinged music is as fresh as the stuff gets these days. She's of limited use showing off a slow groove or going dancehall, and I'm not going to claim she's got redeeming value. But I'm also not going to tell you ""Brothers Ain't Shit"" has nothing to say.

Always too rudimentary a singer and soft a writer to earn the unconditional love of anybody but his famous drinking buddies and the woman who married him three times, this good-hearted, weak-willed people's poet cum no-good bum hasn't given up on yon ""Evergreen Fields"" or that ol' ""Restless Wind."" But for once rank sentimentality is the exception. The thanksgiving of ""Love Is So Sweet"" and flipped bird of ""Leavin' Amarillo"" are equally combative, equally cheerful. Nor is it just the New Year's Eve OD of his guitarist son Eddy that gives ""Hard Hearted Heart,"" ""Star in My Heart,"" and ""Blood Is Thicker Than Water"" their resonance--though you do wonder whether Billy Joe saw the end coming and was doing what he could about it.

Raving the title track as if he has no teeth at all and topping an old reprobate's catchy cannot-love plaint with an old Christian's melodic yours-for-life pledge, the 75-year-old delivers the latest old man's summum. Striving as always to keep the tunes irresistibly familiar without making a fuss about it, he also deploys his knack for strokes of wordplay you swear someone must have gotten to first, and sometimes you'll be right--""I'm playing checkers while they're playing chess"" has been turning trope, although not to my knowledge followed by ""They make the big moves that make me a little less."" On the other hand, ""Is it a lover or a liver/I really need the most?"" in the breakup-qua-detox song ""Last Call for Alcohol"" would seem to be his. Willie delivers ""The Git Go"" and ""Hard to Be an Outlaw"" more tellingly on his new album. But Shaver owns everything here nonetheless.

And also: ""Black's the race 50 per cent of my blood flow/The other flows white or what society won't show."" This never gets catchier than ""Giggahoe""'s freestyle dissing and soul-grown piano-and-horns hook. But the music is deep, subtle, and audacious throughout, claiming its turf with a radio-sample intro that includes FDR and Molly Goldberg as well as MLK and Muhammad Ali. You may think she's consorting with the enemy. You may think she's too middle-class, too judgmental. And you may think she's not earth mother enough to talk so sisterly.

But if they didn't want you to know why she's hanging around so intense they wouldn't put the lyrics on their Bandcamp page. Above all they understand that the two poles actually aren't--""So hold fast to the ones you love/Before they're ripped away,"" on the political ""Night Isn't Bright,"" signifies more acutely in this ripped-apart time than it did when it surfaced in March. Their punkiest move is to seize the intro to Television's ""Venus."" Not actually a punk band, remember. Also not a band that ever understood love as well as this one already does.

On record, at least, Tina Halladay does not have a ""big voice""--a ""gruff"" ""yowl"" or ""wailing typhoon."" She's narrow and high-pitched, her intensity harder to take at 43 or indeed 26 minutes than at the 14 of her band's three EPs. I mention 26 because that marks the spot where the most fetching song here swallows the problem whole. It's a ""disco"" number called ""Pure Desire"" that departs from her fellas' '70s-band aesthetic only if you don't remember what a hell of a '70s band Chic was--a minor masterpiece that conveys how horny and consuming it can be just to lie next to someone you want to fuck. Elsewhere she craves love and defies authority in the equal measure that makes people want to overrate this band. Risk disco, guys. Maybe non-Berniacs will start getting the message.

Shines isn't Robert Johnson made flesh and come to walk amongst us--you should hear his Biograph stuff--but here he takes advantage of his forty-year edge to make an album that's easier to listen to--because it sounds better--than King of the Delta Blues Singers. Engineering is only a means to an end--the real secret is a devotion to the form so passionate that Shines's playing and singing are wild and brilliant as they've never been before.

Although he comes on oversensitive at times, he's no obscurantist and no stupe. When he references Sir Thomas More it's so you remember that utopia seemed an option back ""before murder was cool.""

My tastes in piano run to five-fingered banging, my tastes in ambience to rhythm massage. So although I've admired several of Shipp's many albums, Nu Bop especially, this one I identify with. The hard-driving ""Galaxy 105"" tinkles jazzily at times, and ""Invisible Light"" contributes a free interlude, but mostly Shipp and his certified-jazzbo drums-and-bass--plus, crucially, programmer FLAM--explore pulses and textures: all distinct, some quite jazzlike but most on the trip-hop side.

Although premier violinist and respected singer-songwriter Shires comes by most of her current swell of fame as Jason Isbell's wife, bedrock, and babymama, you wouldn't guess it from the advances she's made in these 10 coolly autonomous, acutely turned, observantly experienced songs. Her soprano incisive over arrangements longer on echo and electronics than you'd expect from tradmaster Dave Cobb, she deals more candidly with attraction (""Parking Lot Pirouette""), lust (""Leave It Alone""), personal rivalry (""Break Out the Champagne""), and even suicide (""Wasn't I Paying Attention?"") than supportive domestic partners are expected to, and hardly plays her violin at all. That's how you end up with an album that takes some getting used to not just because it's unexpected but because it's halfway to sui generis.

""Anchorage"" is the fondest friend-from-a-former-life song you've ever heard. The East Texas barn burning, driving lesson, and beer run evoke the bored fun of a rural adolescence like nothing you could imagine. Shocked understands the tougher formal challenges of protest and metaphoric flight, too, especially on the unclassifiable ""When I Grow Up."" The Jean Ritchie cover seems unsuitably traditional until you realize it's Jean Ritchie.

A formalist's delight--the three principals pursue their theme of Sad Love as obsessively as a cavalier writing sonnets to his lady. Their voices are interchangeably breathy, their tempos unflappably moderate, their guitar hooks unfailingly right.

They're everything I wanted the Slits to be: fast, tuneful, primitive, hard, tender, a little mysterious, and not altogether averse to slow ones. Speedy one's called ""Safety Net"" (they don't have one, ""you"" do), fast one's called ""Almost Made It"" (and if it wasn't for ""you"" we would have), slow one's called ""Somewhere in China"" (searching for a better life).

Because I really like this ridiculously sharp U.K. three-piece, I wish I could tell you that one of their little albums is markedly more desirable than the other. But although they aren't indistinguishable, they are pretty much interchangeable. Both ride full-bodied vocalist-guitarist Rachel Aggs, and both are driven by no-nonsense drummer Andrew Milk and supple bassist Billy Easter. The sound is early-postpunk, Gang of Four times Delta 5--nicely retro-purist if you carry those bands in your memory, fresh and spare if you don't. But the minimalist dexterity of Aggs's guitar flows more irresistibly than either. On both sub-40-minute albums I find my attention flagging as I approach the 30-minute mark even though both sound fine when I begin there and both end with nifty songs--on this 2013 debut, ""Theme,"" the only time they actually address the consumerism you're half afraid a band called Shopping will go on about. Ever alert for a joke, I'm also a fan of the 1:26 opener ""Any Answers."" Consumer alert: vinyl and DL only.

I guess you could say their only CD is even suppler--you can tell they've been woodshedding. Their distinction between time wasted, which is yours, and time lost, which the bad guys have stolen from you, qualifies ""Time Wasted"" as a welcome apercu from a band who have to keep explaining they're not really political because their fan base misses the Gang of Four even more after hearing 2015's What Happens Next. Their fan base's Delta 5 contingent should ask whether the slightly more femme-sounding Billy Easter ever takes the lead on the de facto breakup sequence that begins at the flagging point with ""Sinking Feeling,"" because she should and I'm pretty sure doesn't. Everyone should stick around for the abstract closer ""12345,"" which Spotify reports is their least played track and I report is their most fetching.

This theoretical dance trio are such miniaturists it may take their admirers a play or three to notice that on their third and I guess best album the music has broadened. The catchy treble guitar riff at the start of the 2:38 ""Suddenly Gone"" is partner to the virtual guiro somebody coaxed from a computer at the end--both are the kind of surprise that's good for a tiny thrill when you're out on the floor listening with your body. But no matter how well-honed they are, in this kind of miniaturism all distinctions are marginal--unlike classic Wire or Gang of Four, Shopping never risk a joke or break into something marginally anthemic. For them, ""I know what I like and I like what I know"" is still ""never enough to satisfy me."" Which does limit the use value to which they're theoretically committed.

Backwards street gospel, flamenco handclaps and heelstomps, and Harry Partch microtones move and color an obsessive craftsman's insomniac lullabies. But the unease of Simon's new songs runs deeper than the existential anxiety these technical strokes alleviate, and not just because they provoke musical anxiety to do so. Early in the opener, a Milwaukeean with ""a fairly decent life"" is murdered by his ""fairly decent wife,"" and soon the rich are gobbling all the extra fries as the rest of us hoard canned goods; in the one after that, a bemused tale about a stage door clicking shut transmutes into a meditation on the rage of everyone who'll never get a wristband. Five years ago it was like Simon had been soaking up the Dixie Hummingbirds for so long he'd made his covenant with God. On this record the good news is that heaven has finally been found--located a mere ""six trillion light years away.""

Oddly, while six of the 10 selections are singletons going back to 1973, the other four are from 2000's You're the One, where I remain unconverted to ""Love"" and ""The Teacher"" and am glad to have ""Darling Lorraine"" and ""Pigs, Sheep and Wolves"" on an album I might play again. Never a knockout singer, Simon has arrived at a creaky boyishness that serves him well on arrangements that cant both jazz and chamber while barely hinting at his many shades of folk-rock, including what he's always been too smart to call ""world."" For me the prizes are ""One Man's Ceiling Is Another Man's Floor"" from 1973 and ""Renï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"" from 1990, small masterpieces I'd never recognized as such.

The big deal about the new George Jones record is supposed to be that, due to his near-death experience, he didn't get to overdub the vocals. He should have. One of the few better singers in this century was also a perfectionist cautious about preserving his live shows. Of those officially released so far, this is the most impressive, its lighter and less precise attack good for a grace that's rarely so prominent in the studio work. The audio is exquisite, the repertoire is choice, the excellent Nelson Riddle arrangements are mixed way below the voice, CD technology lets you zap his monologue, and just to affirm our common humanity, he hits a clinker on ""My Funny Valentine.""

With an official live corpus comprising little beyond Vegas dates, statuesque concert stuff, and an insensate 1962 small-group session, this cleanly remastered version of a tape legendary among the bootleggers he's served so well belongs in a canon that's already as outsized as his FBI file. True, it does sample his sense of humor, and although the economy of crack bandleader Norvo offers relief from his usual arrangers, even the greatest vibes players do inevitably play the vibraphone. Nevertheless, there's no authorized Sinatra like this. Its light, relaxed, groove-powered phrasing may not mean as much as the endless timbral subtlety of his studio work, but it gives up the fun his patter misses, as well as the spontaneous musicality those who think him ""merely"" pop claim isn't there. In the ebullient ""Night and Day"" that tops things off, he even risks undermining the lyric. He knows no more heinous sin, and the transgression becomes him.

What makes Doug so moving is the diffidence with which he reflects on his ""mellow"" (and not so mellow, unless you think drought and rail monopolies are just part of the American karma) counterculture experiences; his bohemian sketches aren't any artier than ""She's About a Mover."" On this album the relaxed but sloppy groove of Together After Five meets the attempted musicianship of 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 as Doug rejoins his ""Chicago brothers"" from hometown San Antonio. The result is a blues-based synthesis that's good for a lot of relatively distinctive songs, including ""Stoned Faces Don't Lie,"" his most memorable since ""Mendocino.""

With five of its twelve cuts lifted from Doug's 1969 Mercury debut Mendocino, which I replaced for 97 cents not long ago, and none of the rest from his mid-'70s star shots for Atlantic and ABC, this best-of is pretty archival--a good deed, modest promo for a deserving genre artist. John Fahey's indie is proud to claim now that no one expects to turn his genius into gold. Of course, given the specifics of Doug Sahm's genius, it would have sounded pretty archival in 1973, too. Riding in on Augie Meyer's organ, Tex-Mex like ""Nuevo Laredo,"" ""Dynamite Woman,"" and ""She's About a Mover"" sounds as inevitable as ""Honky Tonk Woman"" or ""Louie Louie."" ""Mendocino"" and ""Stoned Faces Don't Lie"" say more about hippiedom than ""Woodstock"" and ""Eight Miles High."" And ""Song of Everything"" is a dog.

It also has Doug making you believe he just thought up classic titles like ""Old Habits Die Hard"" and ""Revolutionary Ways,"" because he just did.

Buoyed by Augie Meyers's organ and borrowing tunes from the polka conjuntos of his San Antonio raising, the best of his simple songs riff as infectiously as Allen Toussaint's. This 1981 Austin City Limits show, consumer-available as one of a fans-only series that also includes an unnecessary Texas Tornados set, catches him just right at 40. Hard living hasn't wrecked his voice, the musicianship is more disciplined than anything Huey Meaux imposed, new guy Alvin Crow is breaking out, and Sahm is flogging a strong late album.

Kozel leads actual band members, second fiddle though their bass-drums-accordion/saw may play, and sings like a 14-year-old freaked out by the frog in his throat rather than an angel choking his monkey. Informed by two untimely deaths as well as a Kanye-like combo of ailing mother and fractured romance, Kozel is feeling his mortality more concretely than the average young guy struck by the fact that 25 years equals a quarter of a century. Over a bereft, sardonic, punky power strum, he spins out songs that evoke the nearness of death and the fragility of romance all the more suggestively for not being quite literal about either, which is rarely how it works with tenderfoot image-slingers these days. First he's running around with his girl in the ground, then he's helping his mom with her shot. Both ways he feels terribly alone but knows he isn't.

Derek Miller's orchestrated distortions combine the crudeness of the Reid brothers and the virtuosity of Nick Zinner while Alexis-not-Alison Krauss plays the female principle for a childlike sweetness belied by what lyrics you can make out, which suggest in toto that what little human contact this band makes room for will have to wait until such time as sonic immersion fails to satisfy their spiritual yearnings.

Then there's the dying siren that repeats addictively through ""You Lost Me""--the one that makes me say, So what if the lyric is about singing from the grave, death is real, and anyway, I really want to hear that sound again right about--yeah!

That's the kind of thing that happens when you eschew articulation. But listen just a little closer and admit that actual nihilist it ain't. ""Young legends die and so will"" admittedly cuts it close. ""Just because you can doesn't mean you should,"" however, most decidedly does not.

And though Rick's bad dreams are almost as full of niggers and bitches as N.W.A's kiddie porn, his quick, preoccupied singsong drawl makes it gratifyingly impossible to pin down the details.

Smith was the best-selling and best-recorded artist of so-called classic blues. She got top sidemen from her royalty-skimming a&amp;r boss Clarence Williams--Armstrong, Hawkins, Henderson, Goodman, Teagarden--and A-shelf material by the standards of her market. But musically, she's a bigger puzzle than is admitted, and although there may be a better compilation out there, I'll settle for this even though it omits, among other standouts I'm sure, the class-conscious ""Washwoman Blues,"" the guitar-featuring ""Mean Old Bedbug Blues,"" the horncatting ""Empty Bed Blues,"" and the trifling ""It Makes My Love Come Down."" Records certainly spread her fame with the Southern-identified black audience she proudly entertained. But they didn't come near to capturing the live charisma of a funny lady with a big ego and a bigger heart who knew how to shake her big bones. Her singing was more about shading microtones than delivering a tune or powering a groove--she loved medium tempos and she's sometimes, sorry, too subtle. So while blues mavens wish she would sing nothing but, I say the Tin Pan Alley chestnut ""After You've Gone"" is a standout here, and find she benefits in general from the cheap marginal distinction of pop material right down to ""It Makes My Love Come Down,"" a number otherwise uncelebrated in Bessie Smith scholarship--unlike ""Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out,"" ""Backwater Blues,"" ""'Tain't Nobody's Bizness,"" ""Aggravatin' Papa,"" ""Gimme a Pigfoot,"" and whatever else you justifiably believe demolishes such quibbles.

He didn't write much, and he didn't really interpret much either--he was just a vessel for Nashville tunesmiths to pour their product into. But unlike Eddy Arnold, he had no aptitude for the pop sellout, favoring honky-tonk arrangements that inflected his unflamboyant if Nudie-clad persona toward hard-core country. This collection will ring a bell with those who enjoy homely conjugal tropes, the previously unreleased ""No Second Chance"" no less than the number one ""Don't Just Stand There."" And though the number one ""Hey, Joe"" would have been more welcome than either of the side-closing ""sacred"" nonhits, I'll bet Smith and the fans who remember him prefer it this way.

African-American synergy, retain hyphen please, that improves simultaneously on trumpeter Smith's Yo Miles! projects with guitarist Henry Kaiser and the two solid-plus albums the chimurenga revolutionary has cut in Oregon since developing a taste for what he's proud to designate ""the American way."" Even with Kaiser and Woody Lee Aplanalp wailing and wahing, Smith's N'Da Kulture band can't generate the paradoxical melodies and shape-shifting rhythms of electric Miles. So Mapfumo's song-making provides welcome diversion from N'Da Kulture's straightforward postmodern r&amp;b just when you're ready to move on to that Willie Mitchell retrospective. The mbiras and percussion devices of Mapfumo's Blacks Unlimited also jazz things up, which is fine with Smith, who's been calling jazz world music for decades. It's always been a dandy idea in theory. This is the practice.

It's priggish if not stupid to complain that Radio Ethiopia's ""four chords are not well played."" If they were executed with the precise attack of an Aerosmith, then they would not be well played. For although there's no such thing as an unkempt heavy metal record--technocratic assurance is the soul of such music--unkempt rock and roll records have been helping people feel alive for twenty years. When it works, which is just about everywhere but the (eleven-minute) title track, this delivers the charge of heavy metal without the depressing predictability; its riff power--and the riffs are even better than the lyrics on this rockpoet experiment--has the human elan of a band that is still learning to play.

As basic as ever in its instrumentation and rhythmic thrust, but grander, more martial. That's what she gets for starting an army and hanging out with Bruce Springsteen (not to mention lusting after Ronnie Spector), and she could have done a lot worse: the miracle is that most of these songs are rousing in the way they're meant to be. Meanwhile, for bullshit--would it be a Patti Smith album without bullshit?--there's the stuff about ""niggers"" and ""transformation of waste,"" and as if to exemplify the latter there's a great song from Privilege, a movie I've always considered one of the worst ever. Guess I'll have to look at it again.

FALSE,A-,Dream of Life,Patti Smith,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2682,"
At first I took this for that most painful of embarrassments, a failed sellout. Was she unwilling to waste her hard-won politics on weirdos? Proving herself a fit mother by going AOR, only she hadn't heard any AOR in about five years? Sad, sad. But soon I was humming, then I was paying attention, and now I think of this as the latest Patti Smith record. If she doesn't sound as unhinged as last time, she probably isn't, but as matrons go she's still out there. Her prophetic rhetoric is biblical just like always, with a personal feel for the mother tongue I wish more metal Jeremiahs knew to envy. The music is a little old-fashioned and quite simple, controlled but not machined, and the guitars sing. Her Double Fantasy, suggests a Detroit Smith named RJ. Only we don't formalize our equality by doling out turns, adds a Detroit Smith named Fred Sonic.

Tacky though the best-of-plus-outtakes gambit may be, especially with another best-of filling out the box set, this is the same artist who's never released a concert album, not even as a profit taker when her income dried up during her seclusion. And though she's scattered live cuts here and there, the five-track sequence on disc two, dominated by post-1996 material that's never sounded better and capped by the inexhaustible ""Birdland,"" is a welcome taste of the real live one she can put together next with no complaint from me. She recites a Blake poem, a Ginsberg poem, a Prince poem. She blows clarinet. She sings ""Tomorrow"" for her mom. And by the way, the best-of never quits.

Only when I finally bought the CD did I realize how well this pleasant pop I'd been MP3ing through my skull cohered as a self-portrait. This Sam Smith fella is a needy man, insecure about love as all of us are and more candid about it than most. And though manly types may scoff at his pleasing to infernally hooky tunes, not one song approaches self-pity. Both vocally and verbally, they offer the kind of emotional complexity about sexual romance's ins and outs that good pop captures better than good literature, where cynicism is such a folkway. But having established that baseline, let me single out my favorite, the lead ""Money on My Mind,"" an emotionally complex reflection on his record deal. And let me add that the four OK-to-excellent extras on the deluxe edition dilute the original album's effect.

Smither writes tough-minded yet numinous post-folk songs that do justice to his adventurous taste in other people's--the covers include ""Friend of the Devil,"" ""No Expectations,"" and ""Down in the Flood."" His Vaughan-Monroe-sings-the-blues baritone is both yearning and astringent, and he sounds like he wishes he were playing bottleneck even when he isn't. A smart record.

FALSE,A-,Another Way to Find You,Chris Smither,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=599,"
The second release this recovering alcoholic and stagefright victim has managed since 1972--just him, his blue guitar, and a studio full of fans--redoes most of his two early-'70s albums, both out of print since the early '70s were over, and leaves 1985's It Ain't Easy alone. A Cambridge folkie from New Orleans, Smither is an easy taste to acquire: he strums as if to the second line born, sings in a lazy, roughly luxuriant baritone, writes when he's got something to say, and understands o.p.'s from the inside out. I know Randy Newman's ""Have You Seen My Baby"" so well I was sorry he'd covered it, only to be struck like never before by its final lines: ""She say I'll talk to strangers if I want to/I'm a stranger too."" Next day I recalled the title of his first album: I'm a Stranger Too.

Between his somnolent baritone, his blurred melodies, and his big easy guitar, Smither does fade into the background--hear him at a distance and you'd never suspect he was a moral philosopher. But in fact he is that even rarer thing, a moral philosopher with good values, and here his songwriting takes over a career marked by killer covers. From the title manifesto--""These are not petty pleasures/It's a dance that slowly glides/In very complicated measures/That can't be simplified""--to ""Tell Me Why [italics mine] You Love Me,"" he thinks on his butt while keeping the beat with his foot. He's worth attending even if you think blues are history.

Hip house from London, or maybe Germany, where rough-hewn Cincinnati rapper Turbo B was introduced to European culture as a GI. And in the great transcultural Technotronic tradition, it's crazy and radio-ready at the same time. Also funny.

Folkies with a sense of humor are always better off cracking jokes than waxing lyrical. With Snider, though, the differential is near absolute--the one tolerable serious song among these career highlights is the 12-step memoir ""Long Year."" Snider's live-studio differential is steep as well--a crowd sharpens his timing and intonation. ""Beer Run"" was funny enough on 2002's New Connection, but both versions here, including one of those annoying bonus cuts where the artist's buddies can't stop laughing, are eternal nonsense classics. Because he's funny, he does sardonic and bittersweet right. Also because he's funny, the monologues are why you replay the record.

FALSE,A-,Live: The Storyteller,Todd Snider,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15263,"
His second live album in eight years lacks the full functionality of the first, which doubled as a better best-of than the studio one Hip-O put out two years later. But Snider's hang-loose performances are so infectious they reproduce on record even when he's showing the crowd how two unconscious people sprawled into a perfect T across a fondly and farcically remembered stage. So though the songs are from his much improved studio albums of the past decade, most worth owning in themselves, the ""storytelling"" isn't just in the songs. There are stories proper galore, plenty more than the three tracked as such, and every one is worth hearing--always as narrative and usually as music, where Snider's acquired drawl provides a species of musicality akin to that of prime rapping, especially over a vamp. Snider's promise: ""If everything goes particularly well this evening we can all expect a 90-minute distraction from our impending doom."" Pondering the Comcast power grab and the perils of democracy in super-Saharan Africa, I wasn't fully distracted. But Snider's stoned-humanist humor eased my soul.

FALSE,A-,The Best of Phoebe Snow,Phoebe Snow,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2769,"
Most New Yorkers know a woman like this: from a liberal background, with loads of artistic interests, she's insecure about her weight and hence her looks (which are OK at least) and hence her talent (which there's no questioning), and after plenty of therapy her emotions are still all over the place. Only none of her sisters can sing the postblues like Snow--neurotically, that's what she's about, but with incisive power. She's erratic, so given to bad poetry and intermittently eager to please that her albums are off-putting unless you have a weakness for the type. But this compilation--four originals, six covers, including ""Shakey Ground,"" which she owns because it's her all over--is smart, quirky, deeply felt. It proves the type deserves more credit than it usually gets.

Soares was a major samba star for decades--a more robust singer than Gal Costa or Maria Bethania, say, with a voice you can still stream till you drown in it should that option appeal. But I prefer the disruptive Soares masterminded by producer Guilherme Kastrup on 2016's The Woman at the End of the World (A Muher Do Fim Do Mundo)--the same Soares I got to witness holding forth from atop a pyramidal six-foot throne at an enthralled Town Hall in May, 2017. This Kastrup follow-up surfaced a year later, as Soares turned 81, and once again it roughs up the suave beauty of carioca convention. You don't need to know the title translates to God Is Woman to register how Soares's no longer curvaceous contralto makes the lyrics sound skeptical and soul-deep at the same time. But spelunk around and find a few clunky translations anyw""Hyenas on TV,"" say--what in the world could that be about? For a credo, how about ""To be happy at the moment is the strength that envelops me""? And to sum up her spiritual goals? Defining ""clarity"" as ""the day so lucid,"" ""a lucky remnant,"" ""the shadow of death,"" and--best of all--""uncomfortable.""

Sophie Allison's melancholy drags less and charms more than teen-alt's indie-strummed norm, and not only that--it's fortified by tastier guitar parts. So if they hit the palate at a strange angle, figure that's as it should be--love can feel pretty bittersweet when your boyfriend's ex is prettier than you. Or is she, actually? It's so hard to figure out that a few times Allison aspires to a detachment and even cruelty she seems too good a person to be stuck with, much less stuck with faking--a life skill she feels compelled to master because she hasn't learned that the cool kids are as insecure as she is only better at hiding it, from themselves as well as everybody else. So be very glad the finale reports: ""I found God on Sunday/Morning, layin' next to you/My arms stretched out like Jesus/White sheets nail me down to the bed."" Good sex won't solve everything. But it's a terrific way to top off your debut album.

Yet another reshuffled ripoff from these master packagers, and while those who eat their Lower East Side bullshit for breakfast will want something messier, I must admit I love it: superior, edited remixes of the two baddest songs on Evol plus Kim Gordon's Kim Fowley cover--done in a monotone far catchier than the old rip-off artist deserves or could manage himself. Glad they've finally acknowledged this key influence.

Their first true major-label album and first true song album stars the bassist who has always been this paradigm-shifting guitar band's secret weapon. Maybe Kim Gordon overrates Karen Carpenter and undervalues Chuck D. But it's ""Tunic"" and ""Kool Thing"" you'll sing along with, not Thurston Moore's pseudo/macho ZZ Top homage. Her friend Goo is your friend and my friend and the reason this music exists. In a world where songs are still counted girly, we need Goo. And it's her big sister's in-my-room ethereality, direct and spaced out at the same time, that gives her a voice.

Would have been funny to start with Daydream Nation and concoct a perfect Goo-style song album in reverse chronological order from their pre-Geffen catalogue. Only they didn't have the material.

With nothing to prove except that they can do it forever without going gold, they do it again. Recalling their roots, they stretch the title cut past its songful limits and build the finale into a 20-minute improvisation not altogether unreminiscent of the Grateful Dead. But at the same time they stick to the theoretically radio-ready songwriting that is now an aesthetic commitment, even trying their hand at a folk tune and a Shangri-Las tribute. As it happens, the latter owes the Fleetwoods. But needless to say, both ultimately sound like Sonic Youth, an institution whose guitars are often emulated and never replicated. As does everything else on a record that will startle no one and sound fresh in 2002.

They'd rather be Coleman Hawkins, but their long-term consistency recalls less august precedents--say the Shoes, fashioning perfect pop album after perfect pop album in Zion, Illinois. Difference is, the Shoes kept it up for what seemed an ungodly long time and still got bitter and old in the span it took these citizens of world bohemia to absorb Jim O'Rourke and continue the mature phase that began with Experimental Jet Set in 1994, just after they were a fixture and somewhat after they realized they'd never be stars. This unusually songful set is well up among their late good ones, its dissonances a lingua franca deployed less atmospherically than has been their recent practice. I like the lyric about the New Hampshire boys who live for Johnny Winter even if he's a no-show. Our heroes are so much more reliable than that. They can be Coleman Hawkins if they want.

Let us consider the Rolling Stones, a/k/a the world's greatest rock and roll band, who 25 years after their first album bestowed upon us the immortal Steel Wheels. Like said Stones, Sonic Youth are perfect masters of a style they created--a less derivative one, and concomitantly a less accessible one. Over Thurston and Lee's combustible tunings and Steve's strong beat, they've long since learned to construct memorable tunes track in and track out. So why is their 25th-anniversary album so much more fun than Steel Wheels--so sonic, so youthful? You think maybe it's that on a new minor label, with Pavement's old bassist freeing Kim up, they've gathered no moss, or whatever you call that green stuff mucking up the Stones' wheels?

Where Elizabeth slithers, British-Barbadian tenor saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings's queens stand tall: Ada Eastman, Mamie Phipps Clark, Harriet Tubman, Anna Julia Cooper, Angela Davis, Nanny of the Maroons, Yaa Asantewaa, Albertine Sisulu, and Doreen Lawrence--one track apiece, look 'em up. This show of matrifocal bravado sharpens and embellishes Sons of Kemet's unique and arresting sonics: West Indian Coltrane/Rollins over two drummers, tuba for bass, and occasional intoned vocals. Purposefully yet also playfully, the implicit politics channel the sweep of the band's third and most finished album. My favorite sequence calms Angela Davis's speedy clatter with a playground melody that implies Nanny of the Maroons had more time for child care than her military record suggests, after which Yaa Asantewaa's track begins calm and builds like her Ashanti revolution. Or so we are left free to imagine.

It's hard to hear this 26-minute, eight-song, album-shaped deliverable as sex music even though its deluxe edition offers a pricey dildo-plus-buttplug item difficult for guys to share so it must be for ppl with two nearby holes--that is, despite the male auteur's trans gestures, an anatomically conventional woman or two. Not only are the detextured girly voices too cartoony to be sexual, the many clever electronic noises--""Bipp""'s bips, ""Lemonade""'s fizz, ""Hard""'s panoply, the descending hook of the transitional ""Just Like We Never Said Goodbye""--just aren't tactile enough. Except on the merely electronic ""MSMSMSM,"" however, they are funny, beaty, imaginative, and so consumer-friendly they could pass for kind. This is not the future of music.

The riskiest tracks here are the two where the London-to-L.A. producer-vocalist suppresses one half or the other of her disorienting stealth-comic synthesis: the opening ""It's Okay to Cry,"" which leans hard on the soprano whose dulcet artifice is believed by some metaphysicians to represent her TRUE SELF, and the six-minute ""Pretending,"" all strident squalls and swells that roll slowly to a stop like hardening lava or a Harley slurping its last ounce of fuel. Often I tune out the first and get annoyed with the second. But the rest of the album is all laughs and thrills in which sweet clarity defies a panoply of beaty techno sound effects at different junctures every time you listen. For me the most reliable comes as a reward right after ""Pretending"": ""Immaterial,"" where she has the generosity to grant one of technodancepop's most generic and cheerful riffs the Sophie version of eternal life.

Elsewhere on this nine-song, 27-minute EP they're woozier, which isn't to say less punk.

An '80s best-of from Azanian pros who come as close as mbaqanga ever does to Ladysmith--and also to what Americans consider pop music. The saxes are smooth, the deep bass is fluid, a Fairlight fills out five tracks, and the vocals honor old Zulu harmonies while showcasing David Masondo's aching tenor. No matter what they're singing about--as much as they think they can get away with, say--their elegance is something they had to win.

Setting the restrained tensile tenor of David Masondo against the accordion-modernizing Hammond B-3 of Moses Ngwenya, the mbaqanga bestsellers put in 15 years entertaining and uplifting under the thumb of a brutal occupation. Now they've spent 10 more keeping their spirits up and their sound fresh in postapartheid's dystopia. All 25 years are spanned on this compilation. The Soul Brothers' tight, slick harmonies and long, lissome basslines have remained so consistent over that quarter century that outsiders are hard put to remember individual songs, and the one-sentence trots on their earlier Earthworks best-of suggest that the lyrics don't add much to the musical effect. Nevertheless, the intensity of craft here, as well as its determination to seize freedom-bearing American sonics for Zulu tradition, should be tonic for those who doubt they can ever be cheerful again. I mean, back when we could imagine nothing worse, we had a good phrase to describe apartheid. State terrorism, we called it, and we were right.

They can't, of course, Spanish is Spanish just like groove is groove, and because they know the fundamental things apply, their abstractions still hit you in the gut. Voice-keyb-bass up top are distinct and autonomous constituents, a cable not a gumbo, with the upright romanticism of Sebastian Steinberg and try-anything soundplay of Mark De Gli Antoni providing human touch--as they'd better, because rather than anchoring or signposting, M. Doughty's words establish his intelligence and then bounce us back into the aural construct for emotion and such. You may say you pine for his sarcasm.

Souleyman's four Sublime Frequencies albums are similar enough to confuse the lay listener, especially one wary of letting backstory get in the way of the music itself. I tell myself I prefer 2011's Haflat Gharbia because it cherrypicks the non-Syrian performances of a shrewd guy who was by then a world traveler, but I'll never know for sure because it's also the first one I heard, an accident that can sway anyone's judgment. After many tries, I'm pretty sure this is my number two, so I was pleased to learn that it was the first best-of Mark Gergis sorted out for him. I'll also point out that although I fell for the breakneck pace of Haflat Gharbia, here the slow stuff is a respite. Since the subtitle is ""Folk and Pop Sounds of Syria,"" it would seem possible that the slow equals the folk. But Gergis's useful notes make no such distinction.

I don't know how I missed this guy, but though maybe his three earlier compilation-style albums on Sublime Frequencies render this one redundant, I doubt it--played blind, it grabbed me by the what-the? from the moment track two speeded things up and didn't quit till the end of track nine an hour and change later. A Syrian not to be confused with the Egyptian placeholder president of approximately the same name, Souleyman is a local wedding singer turned world-music attraction playing a supposedly dumbed-down, synthed-up, hickoid-metal variant of a major Levantine pop style called, how loosely or precisely I know not, dabke. Recorded in such exotic locales as Berlin, Melbourne, Philadelphia, and Kortrijk, Belgium, this delivers the kind of intensity Lester Bangs craved and almost got when he tore the shrink-wrap off the Count Five's Cartesian Jetstream.

But as someone whose chakras weren't realigned by the house album that ate top 40, I must insist--not only is the emperor still wearing clothes, the new ones fit better. You won't find a ""Keep On Movin'"" here--that honor falls to Snap this year. But the lead cuts are daring and irresistible in their kitschy way, and the boring stretches are all but eliminated--even Fab Five Freddy and Courtney Pine gain the flat-out pop credibility that is Jazzie's true calling.

Boy do the haters get busy on this 16-year-old. But scrutinize the ""superman"" matter (look it up) and you'll see that even if he thought he was sneaking something outlandishly filthy onto a pop record, his fans thought he was inventing a dance that involved flying, thus furthering the presumption of innocence so crucial to his cute. Unlike his crunk forebears, he's not into pimping or dealing or even strip clubs--""Booty Meat"" is as explicit as his carnality gets, and not only is he looking not touching, he's hoping an amateur will ""turn around just like a pro."" He's still boy enough to worry about those F's, and the most winning of his many winning songs was written to, and on, his Sidekick 3. There are enough sonic strokes here to keep the wrong bizzer in ringtone rappers for a year. But Soulja Boy's spiritual secret is that with less subcultural support than, say, Be Your Own Pet, he's reached the top of his world on a few tips from ex-partner Young Kwon and the loyalty of human sidekick Arab. You can hear how tickled he is about it.

This is easily the best--the most galvanizing, kinetic, sensational, catchy--Zep rip in history. And though there may be a philosophical or interpersonal dimension, to me the trick sounds like it was done with songwriting, arrangement, and production. At 70 minutes, it's what used to be called a double album, not quite as long as Physical Graffiti but a lot more consistent. And though their apocalyptic pessimism is almost as content-free as Zep's apocalyptic mystagogy, Zep never reached out like Cornell in ""My Wave"": ""Cry, if you want to cry/If it helps you see/If it clears your eyes/Hate, if you want to hate/If it keeps you safe/If it makes you brave.""

You will not hear strings, jazz, extreme lassitude, the ocean's murky depths, continental drift, and Conlon Nancarrow homages.

Though one distinction between calypso and soca is that the earlier style wasn't geared to phonographic reproduction, I much prefer the two hard-to-find calypso compilations I've recently gotten to know (More Sparrow More!! on Recording Artists, Hot and Sweet on Warner Bros.). And though the greatest of the modern calypsonians claims right here that he's not a ""Soca Man,"" the album's dance groove is compulsive enough for disco. But Sparrow remains a supremely resonant singer with a taste for resonant lyrics: ""Grenada"" lays into Cuban accommodations without letting Reagan off the hook, ""Marahjin Cousin"" satirizes racial complexities unimaginable in our polarized land. The reason he works variations on the same few melodies is that they're all classics. And his groove is worth a go.

Reinforcing my belief that Michael Franti's musical instincts signify more meaningfully than his knowledge of Frantz Fanon, the brother shrouds his funk in so much murk and smoke there are times you could mistake it for Maxinquaye or There's a Riot Goin' On.

Not much music that aspires to pornography achieves the purity of its pleasure principle, and not much pornography does either--not if the ideal isphysical sensation undiluted by either the distractions of romance or the power trips of big-dick netsmut. So Glory's fast-tracked eroticism is an unprecedented achievement even for this longtime professional sex toy. If she has ""personal"" issues, and why shouldn't she, they go unaddressed. But that doesn't mean there are no signs of growth here. Never has she slammed less or cooed more, and never has she seemed so in command of her desires, or so comfortable with them. She always likes her partners and sometimes loves them, but only three of the 17 songs go off message unless you count the voyeuristic one where she catches her doppelganger atop the cad she's driven 250 miles to dump. My favorite sequence tops the single ""Clumsy,"" where they're banging all over the bedroom, with the single ""Do You Wanna Come Over?,"" where she promises not to start kissing and touching without his go-ahead. But since tastes in sex differ radically, you may have your own.

If it takes longer than you'd figure for these jingles to get across, that's partly because the ska they don't quite reinvent tends to skip where the reggae that succeeded it dug in, but also partly because their sound, especially their vocal sound, is just to thin to make an immediate impression (compare their ""Monkey Man"" to Toots's if you dare). In the end, though, there's a jaunty confidence to this music that's a lot less forced than power pop's.

But as someone who prefers lyrics to poetry and is positive there's a difference, I don't find her MFA in the latter an attraction. In fact, I liked her first album enough as music that I only put it away when I got annoyed by its obscurantism. The follow-up's more legible--""We were the French club dropouts,"" tell it sister, though that one's a bit of an outlier. Even if it wasn't, however, I would have compromised my principles, because on the follow-up I love the even nicer Bettie Serveert catch in Sadie Dupuis's voice and the stranger tunes that go with that. And since I also love the guitars, I was intrigued to learn that tourmate guitarist Devin McKnight has replaced original guitarist Matt Robidoux. Dupuis does all the writing and most of the lead parts. But watch a little YouTube and you'll see--McKnight's a major improvement.

In a darker mood than when Foil Deer broke in 2015, as what indie-rocker isn't, Sadie Dupuis returns advisedly to the game she likes best: chunky non-Latinate Americanese wordplay that births dislocated idioms like ""buck me off"" or ""I was lost but now I'm floundered"" or even ""don't wanna lopside my language."" With tunes to match, natch. But she's still bucking ""The year of the weird, bookended by booty pix I never posted"" when she was stalked by a busmate who asked ""what kind of games you like"" and then switched ""games"" to ""porn"" and it got worse than that. ""No no no you're not my bro"" she yells on her way to a ""pink boulder"" where she can ""be alone / With all the girls I know.""

But that cleverness doesn't do justice to the even strength of Spektor's humanism, which often manages to be whimsical and levelheaded at the same time.

Let's speculate that marriage, motherhood, and turning 35--a big one that can sandbag you--are all on her melodically fertile mind. Let's assume it's been pretty sobering. Without being a sad sack, she was always serious. But her softer fans may be daunted by the steely class fable ""The Trapper and the Furrier"" and the fatalistic faux trifle ""Sellers of Flowers,"" by quietly unrelenting five-minute bonus cuts in which an aged solitary celebrates New Year's and old friends compare their polar yet equally confining life paths--maybe even by her fond report that both her baby boy and his dad are better at dreaming than she is. So to help her dream more darkly, she enlists classically inclined producer Leo Abrahams, whose second piano is meant to ensure that ""Obsolete"" sticks around a while.

Smart enough to have figured out that he's ""got nothing to lose but bitterness and patterns,"" he combats his own unease, and there's a payoff--not the nicer girl than he deserves so much as the grace to write her an adult lullaby: ""Your worries are meant to stop for now/You know they're not for keeping.""

Folkie trappings behind him, Springsteen has created a funky, vivacious rock and roll that's too eager and zany ever to be labeled tight, suggesting jazz heard through an open window with one r&amp;b saxophone, or Latin music out in the street with zero conga drums. He celebrates youth in all its irresponsible compassion and doomed arrogance, but he's also old enough to know better--for him, the pleasures of the city are bigger and more exquisite than the defiance and escape that define most hard rock.

He's too white and too male, though he's decent enough to wish he weren't; too unanalytic and fatalistic, though his eye is sharp as can be. Yet by continuing to root his writing in the small victories and large compromises of ordinary joes and janies whose need to understand as well as celebrate is as restless as his own, he's grown into a bitter empathy. These are the wages of young romantic love among those who get paid by the hour, and even if he's only giving forth with so many short fast ones because the circles of frustration and escape seem tighter now, the condensed songcraft makes this double album a model of condensation--upbeat enough for a revery there, he elaborates a myth about the fate of the guys he grew up with that hits a lot of people where they live.

It's protest music, damn right about moral abstractions rather than those finely limned characters good little aesthetes get gooey about, and for me a cathartic up. Second half's less of a scour, which the anti-political find a blessed relief and I find a forgivable nod to humanism and Clarence Clemons--especially since the climactic ""We Are Alive"" is so vulgar as to assume that all America's oppressed will rise up from the grave they share.

If what little remains of the mid-'70s shows that turned him into a legend is overblown enough to make you wonder if you got taken, trust yourself. If the three new originals and four covers don't leap out, figure they weren't supposed to. This album is about continuity and honest reassurance, a job very well done. Although it takes some smart chances (e.g., ""War""), it wasn't meant to shock or enlighten or redefine--it was meant to sum up, and it does.

Two big sloppy marital love songs flank two outbursts of wordplay to kick-start the proceedings at a high that trails off for nine relatively mortal tracks.

Tighter and/or tougher--the guys sharper and bigger, the gal exploiting her nasality to cut through. But unless you care that the objects of Emma Kupa's lust have become more explicitly female, which she herself makes very little of, what really differentiates this from 2010's The Noyelle Beat is that Kupa's now an old pal even if you didn't think about her once since then. Which she suspects maybe you didn't, because right beneath her forthright specificity lurks an edge of anxiety that portends trouble down the road--trouble that may be your fault. Kupa gets around not because she has a taste for the orgiastic like fellow janglers Los Campesinos! but because relationships go awry. She really wishes they wouldn't, or at least that's what she thinks. But partner by partner, she's still figuring it out.

Like few of her predecessors--Martha Reeves comes to mind, and also, odd though it may seem, Teddy Pendergrass--Stansfield's style is virtually devoid of trademark, display, or drama; all she wants to do with these songs she helped write is sing them. The songs themselves are as attractive and unassuming as her voice, a fine instrument that provides more than the expected quota of aural pleasure without drowning you in its bounty. She loves, she hurts, she has her limits. She's going to be around.

FALSE,A-,We'll Never Turn Back,Mavis Staples,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15220,"
One of the rare entertainers to actively support the civil rights movement, gospel-pop-soul matron Mavis Staples honors the music of that movement with these re-created freedom songs. Of documentary value throughout, they're most moving when Staples embellishes them with personal memories, such as her one-young-woman integration of a washateria in Forrest, Mississippi. On her own new ""With My Own Eyes,"" the updated ""99 1/2,"" and producer Ry Cooder's ""I'll Be Rested,"" she doesn't merely revive rousing old songs--she brings their moral passion into the present. As usual, Cooder's refab authenticity can get annoying--he distresses the arrangements with anachronistic guitar stabs like he's antiquing a bureau. But because African-American rhythms come easier to him than Cuban clave, his timing is spot on. More proof that God loves this project: He or She even grants Ry's klutzy son Joachim some tasty loops.

FALSE,A-,Hell Can Wait,Vince Staples,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16654,"
Thematically, there's not much new on this LA mixtape fixture's major-label debut. Nor is he much of an image-slinger. But he's so hard-hitting, so direct, so concise, and before too long so hooky too. Yeah, he does bleed Crip blue (or is that clue, it's so bonfusing). But the compact lucidity with which this EP details the ups and downs of the drug trade and warns women off his money feels less like advocacy, celebration, or autobiography than street reporting. And his best lines rise up when Ferguson moves him to something resembling political speech: ""They expect respect and nonviolence/I refuse the right to be silent.""

FALSE,A-,Prima Donna,Vince Staples,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16871,"
The Crip whose life was saved by DatPiff mixtapes proves how real his gangsta is by stressing on how bad it makes him feel. Wrecking his clipped, high-pitched flow with obsessive moans that don't stop and don't stop, he feels guilty about abandoning the street and guilty about the lives laid waste there. Two of the EP's six songs end by repeating the dejected refrains ""Sometimes I feel like givin' up"" and ""Is it real is it real"" well past their saturation points, while three others hammer away at ""Born ready, war ready,"" ""Pimp hand strong,"" and ""We all waste away"" like they're ""Fuck tha police"" or ""Easy as one-two-three."" The overall effect is admirably grim, with one essential exception: his very old friend Kilo Kish recalling their pre-K years. In this context, McDonald's birthday parties are so cute they're surreal.

On an album that's two-thirds as amazing as is reported, nine-tenths of the amazement is musical. Not just the stripped-down electro powerbeats whose supple muscularity is less 2-step than is reported, but Staples's exacting articulation--he's on every beat smooth and toned, never e-nun-ci-a-ting but without a word lost. Which brings us to, you know, the rhymes. Sure he says what he wants to say with clarity and economy; sure he takes on police racism rampant. But what he wants to say is pretty much the usual except insofar as he doesn't murder anyone while preferring money to women. True, on the last two tracks he contemplates suicide in his first-class seat and muses about the mother of his very unborn children. But you know how it is--they always sneak some soft stuff in at the end. So maybe next time. And maybe not.

For most of this decade, Roebuck Staples--born December 12, 1915, about two weeks after Frank Sinatra--has been the oldest performer with direct access to the hit parade by some twenty-five years, so here's your chance to mind your elders. It's Mavis's lowdown, occasionally undefined growl that dominates, of course; you should hear how secular she gets with an O.V. Wright blues that got buried on The Staple Swingers. But Pops's unassuming moralism sets the tone and his guitar assures the flow.

On any Stax-Staples best-of there will be three indisputable masterpieces: ""Respect Yourself, ""I'll Take You There,"" and above all ""Heavy Makes You Happy,"" composed by those great old soul men Jeff Barry and Bobby Bloom. Sure some of the also-rans are better than others, among them two of the three tracks here that aren't on the more official-looking Best of the Staple Singers: the family-tied ""Everyday People"" and the Movement-themed ""Long Walk to D.C."" But even on perfectly enjoyable filler like ""Touch a Hand, Make a Friend"" and ""You've Got to Earn It,"" you can hear the Stax machine groaning with the effort of squeezing Mavis's intrinsic grit and moral intelligence into a soul stardom she never altogether got the hang of and a contemporaneity by then better pursued with Willie Mitchell just a mile away.

FALSE,A-,Step Brothers Three,Starlito & Don Trip,2017,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17075,"
Starlito, the lower-voiced half of the DIY duo who've broken through to make my favorite hip-hop album of the year, isn't the first to observe that ""ballers wanna be rappers, rappers wanna be ballers."" The difference is that these guys make both ways of life sound like the hard grind their label name isn't the first to claim. ""My future's in that paper bag,"" exclaims Don Trip as he negotiates a cash exchange; ""I ain't been home in the last 30 days / I've been on the road gettin' paid,"" moans Starlito to introduce the high-anxiety ""If My Girl Find Out."" Later come the carefully plotted legal murder of ""Good Cop Bad Cop"" and the modern-day whips and chains that enslave rappers and ballers alike on ""The 13th Amendment Song."" I also like the way they rhyme, say, fortune-Porsche-mortgage-abortion-divorce ya-Nordstrom-extorted-quarters-important-portion-Ford Explorer-torture-hoarder-lawyer-Jordan-Porter (with law enforcement, touring, and President Orange crammed in there too). I also like the way their kids better use their car seats. ""I used to prey on my enemies now I pray for serenity""? I'll buy it. In fact, I just did.

To devotees of machine-age tempos, old-time klezmer often sounds more devotional than celebratory to those comfortable with machine-age tempos, and rather than being coy about this commercial inconvenience, the mandolin master turned clarinet pro embraces it. The bio's ""spiritual jazz"" IDs the result aptly enough, except that any Jew who feels like one will recognize its provenance at 50 paces, one way it avoids the New Age vagueness you rightly fear. Those who don't feel like Jews will be impressed enough that something so solemn can be so light--and glad that Statman isn't above reprising traditional tunes or picking up his sharpest axe.

I can't tell whether the relatively clearheaded politics of these English Jamaicans detract from their ejaculatory, off-center music or make it sound more avant-garde than it is. Both, probably. If their Steve Biko song isn't as affecting as Tom Paxton's, their George Jackson song beats Dylan's, and I can't imagine anyone else, not even Tom Robinson, making a hook out of ""rock against racism."" One of their secrets, as you might have guessed, is a terrific beat. Another is forthright singing of a sort that--and now I'm guessing--can only grow out of unshakable conviction.

Geoffrey Chung's crystalline production, David Hinds's catchy melodies, and Selwyn Brown's straight-ahead vocals may offend those infatuated with reggae's steamy aura of ambiguity: once you get used to the abrasion of their English Jamaican, you notice that neither bass lines nor lead vocals have the tropical thickness of Jamaican Jamaican. Roots, culture, the presence of Jah--who can gainsay them? But over Rastafarianism's deep quietism I'll take the aggressive ideological edge of Hinds's politico-inspirational mode. Also the aggressive pop edge of his romantic mode. And attribute both to urban industrialism, thank you.

But having listened dutifully through the Studio One reissues, I ought to recognize something here besides ""Fatty Fatty,"" so you can't convince me ""vintage"" means sure-shot. And with Leroy Sibbles, Alton Ellis, and Marcia Griffiths the big names, the singers are pretty anonymous as well.

Opening with an economic crash and closing with a smacked-out rumination about succor, betrayal, and Vietnam, the first side seems surprisingly sweet and lyrical--mostly by way of the Manhattan nostalgia of ""Bad Sneakers"" and the faithless passion of ""Rose Darling,"" but also, and most tellingly, in the rumination. This is a matter of rhythm and timbre rather than verbal content--the music lets us know that their cynicism is no more a celebration of cynicism than their smack references are a celebration of smack, lets us know we can break the habit. By comparison the three skillful urban miniatures on side two seem thin and tight, never quite brought around by the more expansive emotions of ""Your Gold Teeth II"" (throw them out and see how they roll) and ""Any World (That I'm Welcome To)"" (""Is better than the one I come from"").

The man who invented the bootleg mix has an ear that predates the Sugarhill Gang and a borscht-belt sense of humor. He flows records into a linear funk devoid of depth charges, liminal sounds, and other perversities on the cognitive dissonance tip. This radio show turned so-sue-me CD leans heavily on dance-friendly hip hop both commercial and underground, older r&amp;b, and known spoken-word--Eve and Blackalicious, JB's and Marvin Gaye, Marx Brothers and Music Man. What I can't ID I'll live with enjoying. But I would like to know the real-life identity of the rapper who plays the inept role model and whatnot. If Steinski didn't script him, who did?

Though they named heavy metal, sort of, they were more hard rock, in both the principled '60s sense and the prole '90s sense. Rather than swamps of pomp a la Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly, even Blue Cheer, their two 1968 albums were floods of sludge. They had tunes, lyrics, verve; they had a good beat and you could wheelie to them. Never as slick as his sunglasses after dark, German-born, Canadian-raised, r&amp;b-loving, legally blind ex-folkie John Kay soon grew full of himself, in a sincere, pot-smoking way. But 30 years later his '70s FM staples pack more punch than the half of the debut this revision of 1975's Sixteen Great Performances leaves in CDNow. They also pack more punch than the lesser leavings of another hard rocker with a pop knack and a best-of out, Alice Cooper. Not only is Kay nicer--the gauche ""For Ladies Only"" isn't hip to the feminist jive like ""Only Women Bleed,"" but it sure tries harder--he has a better drummer. Jerry Edmonton, died in a car wreck.

Scornful though one may be of Stevens's beliefs that ""classical music"" is ""high art"" and Christ Jesus died for our sins, it would be rigid in the extreme to deny his melodicism. There's not an unattractive tune on a record rife with counterpoint and interlude; musically, it's so inspired--and because it does its appointed work simply and unhurriedly, so unpretentious--that nonbelievers had better accept that he's getting over on talent, not talk. Religion arises mainly in the immensely touching, and unorchestrated, ""Casimir Pulaski Day,"" where the cancer death of a teen love occasions something resembling doubt. The historically inclined may object that Steven's portrait of the great state of Abraham Lincoln and Ozzie Guillen is impressionistic to the point of whimsy, and I myself would die a smidgen happier if I never heard another song about a mass murderer. But this album radiates positive energy, and in today's alt, that's a precious thing.

Always impressed and never bowled over by the auteur's albums, I only caught his musical after this original cast recording hit me like no Stew or Negro Problem CD ever had. Two clues emerge in the guitared-up ""Prologue"": first ""If you're ever not sure what I'm all about/Just ask the song,"" then ""Since it's my job I'ma set the scene."" Music as surrogate self, music as daily occupation--if Stew never shone as brightly as he had to on his own records, his craftsman's approach to his lifework was why. But these limitations feed into this amusing, moving, sophisticated, less than profound Broadway show about racial identity and art for art's sake. Stew the narrator expresses himself more subtly and forcefully than he ever did as mere persona--the distance frees him up. Similarly, two songs that satirize themselves, the Afro-hardcore ""Sole Brother"" and the Euro-anarchist ""What's Inside Is Just a Lie,"" pack straightforward power. But in the end, there's only one standard: ""Keys,"" a celebration of the occasional kindnesses of the bohemia where this 47-year-old African-American has spent his adult life.

Few artists in any genre have seemed more tortured, dissolute, or full of beans than our era's greatest honky tonker. Already in his thirties when he put out a passel of striking if loosely principled LPs for RCA between 1975 and 1981, he dried out before re-emerging with the '88-'90-'93 albums HighTone's purists expertly reshuffle. Although the self-written songs here are less succinct than ""Drinkin' Thing"" (""to keep from thinkin' things"") or ""She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles),"" they do justice to his desperate abandon; delivered in a growlier version of his star-time vibrato, ""They ought to make a brand new whiskey/And give it a woman's name/A man needs somethin' to hold on/When her goodbye hits him like a hurricane"" captures every aspect of his worldview except the part where he cheats first. Settled in south Florida, Stewart released no more albums until 2003's Live at Billy Bob's Texas, which is currently hard to come by. Last spring his wife died, and last month he shot himself in the neck, so he could die too. At 59, the man who sang ""There's nothing cheap about a cheap affair"" had been married 43 years.

But his solo debut proved such a landmark that when he opened this one with a title tune about the slums featuring only mandolin and acoustic guitar I didn't even snicker. Much all-around excellence here--Stewart writes songs with almost as much imagination as he picks them, and his band is as (dare I say it?) sensitive as his voice.

He's so in love with the run of life that it would be a contradiction for Stewart to attempt any grand aesthetic advances, so why wonder whether his art is improving until it gets boring? This doesn't peak as high as Every Picture. But ""You Wear It Well"" starts ringing in your head like ""Maggie May"" after a couple of plays. The three originals on the first side check in not long after. And Stewart's augury of the incipient early '60s revival.

Stoican was a not quite brilliant Romanian Gypsy violinist who in the early '60s personally apprehended a spy on the Black Sea coast.

Yet despite its sonic impact I find that the primary appeal of the music isn't physical--I have to be in a certain mood of desperate abandon before it reaches my body. It always interests me intellectually, though--with its repetiveness beyond the call of incompetence and its solitary new-thing saxophone, this is genuinely ""avant-garde"" rock.

As for his realism, I took it more seriously once he claimed he'd be in museums 500 years from now. All I know about his education is that he name-checks Carl Jung, but the streets he represents are a literary creation. Sometimes they rock, definitely. But sometimes words fail him.

For Tom Morello to swap Zack De La Rocha for the smarter, funnier, savvier, flowinger Boots Riley looked better than it sounded on the resultant album, due partly to Riley's loss of lyrical bite and partly to the musical falloff from Coup to mere Rage. But on this apparent afterthought Riley sounds as mad as ever, calling out the pres by name and declowning himself on ""Scars (Hold That Pose)"": ""This old ripped jacket is 'cause I am an artist/I'll burn rubber on you if my car'll get started/Third month avoiding landlords is the hardest/It's only funny 'cause you don't see where the scar is."" And this being an EP, there are killer covers. ""Paper Planes"" is subtly revised from a song about how they'll take your money to a song about how we will.

I'll even let them have a pastoral fantasy--seems like a fair antithesis to their urban reality, an antithesis captured neatly on ""Country Living"" by the clash of extreme artifice and back-to-nature rhetoric. The first side doesn't quit, and although I could do without the silly (and musically long-winded) politics of ""People Make the World Go Round"" on the second, I can also make do with them.

What I love about the Stylistics is that they're so out of it. Authentic modern-day castrati, they elevate the absurd high seriousness of the love-man mode into an asexual spirituality that the Delfonics, say, only hinted at--and the country-rock harmonizers only fake and exploit. Their spirituality doesn't have much to do with real life, but it's always liberating to encounter it on the radio. And now, with the flick of a switch, you can approximate this liberation in your home.

Life after ""Oh Bondage Up Yours"" began with Poly's dreamily unpunk 1980 studio-rock Translucence, a sui generis switcheroo absurdly accused of presaging Everything but the Girl. Now there'll be claims her easy-skanking groove is a ""dubstep"" breakthrough, once again obscuring the main reason her music has connected since she wore braces, which is that it's exceptionally tuneful, if not the main reason we care, which is that she's an exceptionally good soul. She never tops the vegan opener ""I Luv Ur Sneakers."" But the four humanist protest songs she rolls out just before an unnecessarily dreamy closer seem so unforced you feel for all those who have striven so hard to do nothing more. Ari, Viv, Exene--because sisterhood is powerful, this one's for you.

Listen faithfully and you'll find more, beginning with the geographical-anatomical title lick. But in truth I wish they weren't so subtle, just as I wish the clave aficionado had enlisted a rhythm section instead of recording these 14 songs as if his 1969 nylon-stringed Ramirez classical guitar was Leadbelly's steel, which it isn't--momentum-wise, anyway. That said, phrasing that stops you short he can do, and lyrically he's something else. ""Flow"" and ""Between Piety and Desire,"" ""Gangster Roots"" and ""The Auctioneer's Nightmare,"" ""Drugs (Fuck All You Motherfuckers)"" and ""Hey God""--these deliver the requisite lyricism, complexity, and rage, respectively. The Jefferson song, entitled ""Sally,"" delivers all three.

Not only that, one of them is dead. The prognosis is so dismal that it takes time to hear that this ska is evolving toward sinuous skank rather than reverting to zit-popping thrash, to ascertain that the tunes are simple rather than pro forma, to believe that Brad Nowell writes like he's got a life even if he ended up wasting it. Junkies who retain enough soul to create music at all are generally driven to put their brilliance and stupidity in your face. Nowell is altogether more loving, unassuming, good-humored, and down-to-earth--or so he pretends, which when you're good is all it takes.

You tend to suspect anyone who releases three double-LPs in eighteen months of delusions of Chicago, but Donna is here to stay and this is her best album. The first two sides, four songs per, never let up--the voice breaks and the guitars moan over a bass-drum thump in what amounts to empty-headed girl-group rock and roll brought cannily up-to-date. Moroder makes his Europercussion play on side four, which is nice too, but side three drags, suggesting that the rock and roll that surfaces here is perhaps only a stop along the way to a totally bleh total performance.

Don't believe old fans with their collective pre-midlife crisis. Believe a codger who has ever thought them an honorable band whose sole great record was damn near their first, the satirically candid ""Slack Motherfucker."" Here, 20 years after he started trying if trying is what that was, Mac McCaughan finally assembles an album that captures what could be glimpsed in that single and the only live show I ever saw them give (Lollapalooza '95). Eschewing both the lo-fi murk that obscured vocal yowl and guitar roar alike on the early albums and the fruity pop voice he affected as the centuries did their thing, McCaughan and cohort deliver a bunch of loud guitar songs--not anthems, songs--whose unkempt tailoring and melodic uplift are worthy of betters from Nirvana to the Arcade Fire. Providing myth to die for and money to burn respectively, those two bands made this claim on history possible. The hoarse, throaty voice knows its consonants, and the lyrics are full of the everyday breakdowns most of us survive into midlife and beyond--""about nothing and everything,"" which is what they always wanted even if they were too cool to make it plain.

So it's only natural that this is less of the same, and that in ""Void"" and ""Staying Home"" early on he's as bummed as a good grunge visionary should be. Not that bummed isn't a valid feeling appropriately expressed. But its validity is put in context by what comes right in the middle: ""Trees of Barcelona,"" about the euphoria of sharing a rock festival in the capital of international bohemia. That's the Merge co-founder's life. Give him credit for knowing it's been a lucky one.

From tiny Guinea-Bissau--formerly Portuguese Guinea, wedged between Senegal and Guinea proper, independent since 1974, population well under a million then and well over a million now--came a band that lasted a decade, even played one of Fidel's Havana youth conferences, but recorded only once, leaving six hours of master tape in Lisbon in 1980. Where the music of nearby Cabo Verde is dominated by mestizo variants on Portuguese fado, Guinea-Bissau had few white settlers, and if Super Mama Djombo recall anyone as they mix and match across West Africa, it's early Orchestra Baobab, hold the salsa. Soukous and highlife echo in the guitars, and the notes suggest that these songs in many languages--six tribal tongues in addition to the urban Kriol they favored--needed to be sung.

Too young to be post-ironic and too self-aware to actually be naive, she's a find and probably knows it. So root for her with your fingers crossed.

A.B. Crentsil wanted to be liked, and he was ready to sweet-talk anyone who got in his way. The least of these six circa-1979 highlife tunes is subtly ingratiating, and the charm of the three English-language numbers subsumes the Christian politesse they promote.

There are always lacerations in store when you try to catch new wave after new wave, and even in Florida John Paul Pitts knows he can't avoid them. But there's something relaxing about the warm air, ocean access, and bikinis of West Palm Beach. That's why the statement of purpose isn't the sound-setting ""Floating Vibes"" or the breaker-breaching ""Swim"" but a ""Take It Easy"" so much more kind and less arrogant than the Eagles song he may never have heard. Is the ""mama"" who melts the ice in him and keeps him up shivering a crush or, as indicated, a song? My guess is a song; a song so simple it only has two sections, both catchy. The crushes will come later, and they'll lacerate too. ""My love is a carnivore,"" Pitts croons like he's loving some Beach Boys high part. But he delivers a reprise of the same B part in a more forceful, normal voice: ""Why is everything a chore?/I'm too young to be defeated."" So far, he isn't. Wish him luck with that riptide.

Much later there was the disarming ""I Can Help,"" which went to No. 1 just before ""Kung Fu Fighting"" in 1974. Like Carl Douglas, this mild-mannered rockabilly then dropped from pop sight, but unlike Douglas, he was prepared to pursue his muse where he always had, twixt Memphis and Nashville. Numerous minor country hits ensued, along with at least four albums whose big heart and simple tunes showed up Nashville careerists and ""outlaws"" for the smarm merchants they were. With his adenoidal pitch and nice guy's morality, he wouldn't stand a chance in Nashville today. With his nice guy's empathy, he wouldn't cut much of a figure in alt-country either.

Especially after ace arranger Paul Owens signed on midway through their 1951-55 Specialty stint, the Swan Silvertones relied on a formula. But so did Motown. The problem with this one is the way it was slicked up melodramatically just afterward, during the group's Vee-Jay peak. The center is always Claude Jeter, direct forebear of Al Green and a more crucial gospel falsetto than Rebert Harris himself. But at Specialty Jeter is in a sense the straight man, and for us secular sinners that's good. What happens around him is the formula: the star holding steady as hard-shouting Solomon Womack and Robert Crenshaw wild out.

All year I've been wasting good review time listening to the commercially unavailable rap mixtapes Cornerstone Promotion mails out. Hopping hiply among foreshortened current and prospective hits, exclusive freestyles, and unclassifiable obscurities, they convey as no single-artist album can the image of an inexhaustible culture comprising an infinity of adjustable musical parts. Sway and Tech, whose Wake Up Show is said to reach 11.5 million listeners on 17 stations, accomplish something similar on the first major-label rap mix record unimpinged by discernible copyright hassles. Rather than embracing a whole culture, though, they merely establish the underground's right to claim old-school, as when snippets of ""I Know You Got Soul,"" ""Looking at the Front Door,"" and ""They Reminisce Over You"" lead from the Jurassic 5 to Kool Keith and improve both.

But soon she's off those pills, and then it transpires that the ""Bottle by My Bed"" she craves comes with milk and a rubber nipple. Proceed to ""Grow Old With Me""--next line: ""I'll keep you young forever""--and a title tune in which a proud trophy wife skewers his ex with the perfect putdown: ""I'm his trophy for putting up with you."" Why am I not surprised that these last three, the finest songs on an album filled with good ones, are Lori McKenna cowrites? ""Grow Old With Me"" to ""Trophy"" bears the mark of someone who's looked at marriage from many sides now.

So he lets guitars define the ineffables for him--his stormy acoustic, Lloyd Cole's workaday electric chunka, and Greg Leisz's choked steel provide a forum where Richard Lloyd and Robert Quine can testify. And though Lloyd shouldn't be forgotten--his slash and roll jumpstart the record--it's Quine's aural kabala, longer on syntheses of ache and soar than on terrible beauty or abstract calm in this context, that contains the wisdom Sweet needs.

The seven earlier cuts, recorded on a 1978 U.S. visit, fall in the five-minute range and will charm if you give them a chance.

Even in their overwork, however, they evince an effort that bears a remarkable resemblance to care--that is, to caring in the best, broadest, and most emotional sense.

One hopes not in both cases, although verisimilitude has its formal aspects for bestsellers. Swift hits the mark less often than Merritt--65 or 70 percent, I'd say. But one could argue that the verisimilitude requirement forces her to aim higher. I like the feisty ones, as I generally do.

The NYC tourist jingle everybody hates on to prove they're not her shills is my favorite thing here. Having emigrated to Manhattan myself, albeit from Queens, I think it's silly to demand sociology from someone who can't stroll Central Park without bodyguards. I note that even from a limo you can tell that the ""everyone"" here who ""was someone else before"" includes many immigrants of color. And I credit its gay-curious moment even if she ends up with a banker like her dad. All that said, however, there's a big difference between Swift's Manhattan and the one I can afford only due to real estate laws as vestigial as the family grocery that just closed up across the street, and you can hear that difference in the music. In principle I'm down with the treated hooks and doctored vocals with which Swift makes herself at home. Freed of Nashville's myth of the natural, she echoes and double-tracks and backs herself up, confides with soft-edged subtlety and fuses the breathy with the guttural. But I have less use for the cyborg with feelings she's playing now than for the gawky 15-year-old she created on Fearless--the one who was a hundredth as talented and a tenth as self-possessed as the 18-year-old who imagined her, the one who gathered an audience of country fangirls Nashville didn't know existed. That fifteen-year-old obviously isn't much like me. But she's more like I was when I got here than the cyborg will ever be, or most bankers either.

But here supereclectic jazz bassist Buell Neidlinger mixes with fiddler Richard Greene and mandolin whiz Andy Statman, both of whom do astute work whenever they're given the chance, and together they play three of the sprightliest Ellington tunes you'll ever hear, as well as three of the drollest Monks. Drummer Peter Erskine is too heavy-handed for the gig, but at least he's a jazzman of sorts, and though tenor player Marty Krystall's solo space impinges on the mood a little, he's got the spirit too. Even Peter Ivers's slightly klutzy harmonica fits in. Left-field instrumental of the year.

These days almost all r&amp;b goes for voice-plus-sound rather than voice-plus-song, with the sound ranging from precision track-and-hook to idiosyncratic atmospherics. What distinguishes Odd Future fixture, Internet instigator, and matter-of-fact lesbian Sydney Bennett is that she powers her solo venture with one of the smallest voices in popular music--not tiny, just soft and slender. No fan of power tonsils, I've always been drawn to her brave sighs and whispers, and love how easily her voice carries this music unaugmented by her former guitar and drum kit. I also like how she celebrates an economic success I hope is as permanent as she thinks--""middle to upper class,"" you don't hear that much. But since love is more important than money, I warm most to these tracks when they turn to eros, and admit that the most winning, ""Dollar Bills,"" is also the only one to avail itself of some male timbre. Very deep. Very resonant.

And it don't stop. Compare any current salsa record and you'll hear the difference immediately--this stuff is much rawer. It's the music of people who are overjoyed to be able to put their hardships aside for an hour or two. They know the hardships are still there, but they haven't been sapped by them, and they need to prove that to themselves and the world.

But when the improvs begin, we're back in riffland, where such spare, exemplary soul melodies as ""Hip Hug Her"" and ""Time Is Tight"" were born--and where Mr. T. can get back to fleshing out (and heating up) the disciplined cross-rhythms of his Memphis Group.

Lucky for us, here he elects to catch his breath, retreating from message disco into an Algerian equivalent of Bowie's Pin Ups or GN'R's Spaghetti Incident. An instant touchstone of Arab song and a Taha-composed tour of rai history pitch the collection higher than it can remain if it's gonna be as trad as the artist thinks decent.

A debut LP will often seem overrefined to habitues of a band's scene, so it's not surprising that many CBGBites felt betrayed when bits of this came out sounding like Sparks or Yes. Personally, I was even more put off by lyrics that fleshed out the Heads' post-Jonathan Richman, so-hip-we're-straight image; when David Byrne says ""don't worry about the government,"" the irony is that he's not being ironic. But the more I listen the more I believe the Heads set themselves the task of hurdling such limitations, and succeed. Like Sparks, these are spoiled kids, but without the callowness or adolescent misogyny; like Yes, they are wimps, but without vagueness or cheap romanticism. Every tinkling harmony is righted with a screech, every self-help homily contextualized dramatically, so that in the end the record proves not only that the detachment of craft can coexist with a frightening intensity of feeling--something most artists know--but that the most inarticulate rage can be rationalized.

David Byrne's celebration of paranoia is a little obsessive, but like they say, that doesn't mean somebody isn't trying to get him. I just wish material as relatively expansive as ""Found a Job"" or ""The Big Country"" were available to open up the context a little; that way, a plausible prophecy like ""Life During Wartime"" might come off as cautionary realism instead of ending up in the nutball corner with self-referential fantasies like ""Paper"" and ""Memories Can't Wait.""

Live albums by essentially nonimprovisatory artists who do definitive work in the studio are always slightly extraneous, but the choice songs and prime performances compiled on this twofer (one disc 1977-79, the other 1980-81) may turn out to be definitive themselves.

With Eno departed, the polyrhythms no longer seem so portentous--this funk is quirkily comfortable, like the Byrne-produced B-52's or the three-piece of Byrne's earlier primitivist period. Unfortunately, the polyrhythms no longer seem so meaningful, either. Though God knows there's no rock and roll rule that says playfulness can't signify all by itself, the disjoint opacity of the lyrics fails to conceal Byrne's confusion about what it all means. Yet side two lights me up nevertheless, sandwiching the purest anticapitalist song he's ever written and the purest prolove song he's ever written around two pieces of typically ironic-optimistic futurism.

Seeking an adjective for this remarkable yet narrow international debut from the biggest band in Niger, I arrived at ""terrific."" Terrific in the honorific sense--real good album. But also terrific in the lost sense of deeply scary. Eight tracks lasting a mere 50 minutes (live, the story goes, they play five hours a night every night) and featuring a mere six musicians (live, apparently, substitutes switch off): two guitars, trap and tama drums, accommodating bass, and a singer whose day job is judge (but how long are his days?). And for 50 minutes the barrage never stops--""Sarkin Fada"" mellows slightly, but in general two guitars are louder than one, the drummers bash and clash, the tempos speed on, and the judge declaims with the voice of authority. Because there's so little give in it, this isn't really groove music except in the sense that EDM is groove music--Syrian dabke, for instance, is sensuous and jolly by comparison. It's just rhythm music, on its own unrelenting terms.

The many-faceted title ""tune"" shows off moving parts you'll never keep up with as it stampedes past, and the grooves vary noticeably track to track--which isn't to suggest that the energy ever slackens. In short, a band capable of striking fear in the hearts of anti-immigrationists all over their cryogenic cradles of Western civilization.

Another good idea was the lead solo one of three named guitarists takes on the so-called ""Entente""--really, this uncompromising thing is an entente? Unrelentingness having been the specialty of this shifting cast of male Nigeriens for three CDs now--14 are credited, including six singers and four drummers--both effects render them somewhat more accommodating while remaining dead set on directing your attention to nonstop rhythm music. If Youssou seems too calm and unflappable even live these days, try this. It will not let you be.

This is the kind of second album where the group flowers rather than the kind where the group runs out of material. Read the trots and there's an arc, budding romance through to sustaining love, with plenty of self-doubt and plenty of solidarity in between. Listen to the music and you may get similar notions, although obviously they'll be more inchoate; I like the way troubled thoughts about alienation transition to lively celebration of a desert ""full of liberty"" to rousing call to fellowship to the solemn knowledge that ""nothing is eternal."" My theory is that it takes a man aware of his existential doubts to commit to the desert without committing to the absolute at the same time, and that this comes out in the music.

Life got even tougher for the Kel Tamashek before this album was recorded, as thugs claiming piety imposed Sharia on a nomad culture that never trucked with the sadism of Islam's self-proclaimed ultra-orthodox. So as they fled their ancestral base in eastern Mali, these commercially ascendant, politically down youngbloods found themselves with a double set of injustices to address. And on an album whose title translates Sisters, that's what they've done. They've done it by honoring the uncommonly woman-friendly Tuareg ethos, including the installation of Wonou Walet Sidati, a female veteran of their revered Tinariwen, as the (near) equal of Ousmane ag Massa. They've done it by embracing both rock drumming and West African beats. They've done it by upping the Third World skank and absorbing a French guitarist and telling the world that the spacey ""Assikal"" is their Pink Floyd song. They've done it by voicing their despair and living their dreams at the same time. They've done it the 21st-century way.

Faster than a speeding stallion, deeper than the well they'll throw your mother down, these leathery oldsters and manly upstarts alternate testosterone-packed displays of time-tested tunes and time-testing rhythms.

Youngish lothario Caliu's speed runs out of gas where ancient and now deceased leader Nicolae's deliberation keeps on coming.

I wish I could tell you who takes the first violin break on their old ""Clejani Love Song,"" a 20-second countermelody that sums up their collective pizzazz so irresistibly that all three violinists join in when it comes around again, and again, only to change it up around the seven-minute mark, and that ain't all--the track clocks in at 11:11. Most of the 13 songs are briefer, but their immersion in tradition never reins them in. The male voices are somewhat less grizzled, but you know they'll roughen too.

Tate is a blues-drenched Macon native who had the desire to head north and sounds it every time he gooses a lament with one of the trademark keens that signify the escape he never achieved. He brought out the best in soul pro Jerry Ragovoy, who made Tate's records jump instead of arranging them into submission, and gave him lyrics with some wit to them besides.

And who do you prefer when it comes to redundant--the laid-off prole who gets the job done night in and night out or the college-educated goon who pronounces him excessed? Taylor had less class than a metal-shop teacher in a finishing school, and he always believed that making music was the same thing as having fun.

Gritty, rhythmic, and felt just aren't enough--thee has to be something absolutely distinctive in the phrasing and timbre, and he's always been a little vague in both departments. But on this compilation there's plenty of definition from Don Davis, who has production and writing credit on five of the six cuts on side two, an examination of monogamy and its vicissitudes that will shortly be covered whole by none other than Charley Pride. (Just kidding.)

Despite the somewhat self-serving title--the man did record for Stax pre-Don Davis, and the final track has never been a single before and will never be called a hit again--this testifies. Only on the breakthrough ""Who's Makin' Love"" did he ever cut a track to equal any of dozens by Otis or Aretha, but for a journeyman he's a minor genius--who knows more about fucking around than Alfred Kinsey.

Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters were subtle, Etta James is more so; in his wry, unschooled way, so even was Hound Dog Taylor. The long-reigning blues mama still isn't subtle-cf. the original ""Man Size Job"" by Ann Peebles, hardly Billie Holiday herself. She's no composer, either. But she owns owns owns the gender-switched Bo Diddley rewrite ""I'm a Woman,"" the Johnny Otis obscurity ""Beer Bottle Boogie,"" two Louis Jordan covers, and, most dramatically and impressively, ""Wang Dang Doodle""-play her version, not Wolf's, at my damn funeral, 'cause maybe it'll wake me up. Both Chicago and jump blues are dealt a short hand by the houserocking idea. But except for Hound Dog himself, nobody has made as much of it as this leather-lunged trouper. Finally she has an album that proves it.

FALSE,A-,Musique classique andalouse de Fï¿½,Ustad Massano Tazi,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15385,"
Sufi Arab-Andalusian healing music attributed to Ziryab, the legend""Black Songbird"" from Baghdad who Ned Sublette conjectures became a prototypical guitar hero in the court of Cordoba circa 800--a fashion plate and oenophile who supposedly knew 10,000 songs, added a fifth string to his lute, developed his own compositional system, and invented toothpaste. No one knows the facts, of course--the notes say he was based in Granada, for instance--and claims that this is how compositions we're not even positive he wrote sounded a millennium ago seem inflated. Some things are clear, however. The gut-stringed and sometimes hide-backed instruments here haven't been used regularly since the 18th century. The proportion of bowed violins etc. has been reduced from the modern norm. Whatever we think of the theories of humors and elements that underlie Ziryab's system, his cosmology honored timbre above all. And whatever the performers think of those theories, they're Sufi mystics who believe in the music itself. Alternating the vocal and the instrumental, the rhythmic and the arhythmic, the high and the low, the result is lighter and less hypnotic than the Sufi healing music of Oruj Guvenc. Some of its more contemplative sections require dedicated listening, and its timbres take a while to sink in. But that's what timbres are so good at doing, and eventually these calmatives make themselves enjoyable and make themselves felt.

Fitting that true house's first true smash should prove a fountainhead of formal innovation, albumizing the genre's natural configuration, the 12-inch, with followups that suggest remixes--alternate versions of Ya Kid K's unjustly maligned punk-house songtalk and the technogroove underpinning the smash. There's also a male rapper who rhymes ""posse"" and ""bossy"" (ho!). If you love the single as much as you should, the album will keep you going. And if you're in thrall to moribund aesthetics, there are other songs on it.

So if the guy's cuts fade and the girls' take me to techno church, maybe the secret of this spiritual uplift for secular people isn't Bogaert and De Meyer after all. Maybe it's the girls.

So put it this way. These twin neatniks are wound tight and make something of it. Those who believe loose is the only real may find them prissy or worse. I think their half-enigmatic little songs humanize the neat. They sing of love in perpetual suspension, only partly camouflaged by the emoluments of harmonic closure.

It's kind of a hoot for twin sisters to begin Indigo Girls, wind up Maroon 5, and just get gayer as they do. In the synth-cushioned highlight ""Boyfriend,"" Sara wheedles/implores her bi-or-not gf to make up her mind with a hook that goes ""I don't want to be your secret anymore."" Other winners include the contrite ""That Girl,"" the erotic ""Stop Desire,"" and the anti-marriage ""BWU."" But thematically, these women are adaptable. Every track is a three-minute formalist construct that captures a mood rather than a three-minute romanticist statement that expresses an emotion. Some of these moods are more complex than others. But every one is catchy.

Those scandalized by Marquee Moon's wimpoid tendencies are gonna try to read this one out of the movement. I agree that it's not as urgent, or as satisfying, but that's only to say that Marquee Moon was a great album while Adventure is a very good one. The difference is more a function of material than of the new album's relatively clean, calm, reflective mood. The lyrics on Marquee Moon were shot through with visionary surprises that never let up. These are comparatively songlike, their apercus concentrated in hook lines that are surrounded by more quotidian stuff. The first side is funnier, faster, more accessible, but the second side gets there--the guitar on ""The Fire"" is Verlaine's most gorgeous ever.

They have declined, it's true. Though my animus against ""Ball of Confusion"" disappeared the moment I heard four teenaged girls sing it in a doorway on Avenue B, ""Psychedelic Shack"" and ""Don't Let the Joneses Get You Down"" are worthy of the Monkees and a couple of the love songs (on the same side, I'm happy to report) are drab. But ""Cloud Nine"" and ""Run Away Child, Running Wild"" not only work as pop protest but bear witness to how funky these smoothies have become. And so do such pinnacles of harmony as ""I Wish It Would Rain"" and ""I Can't Get Next to You.""

Of all the Saharan musicians to surface in the past decade--more than any American could have figured, and more than any non-Saharan has much practical use for--this three-man Tinariwen spinoff are the catchiest and most hypnotic. Stay with them a few hours and their every tune will stake a claim as both your trusted companion and the music's reason for being. Stated solo and then reprised in chorus, each is repeated by Diara or Sanou's no-nonsense guitar, supported by Abdallah's trickier bass, and nicely embellished by fourth-wheel French percussionist Matthias Vaguenez. Sanou sings roughly, Diara sweetly, but ample translations revisit the familiar concerns of the once-nomadic Tuaregs: ""freedom"" and cultural unity to counteract the displacements of African nationalism. It's the music of wise elders, and of restless men economically dependent on a skill that would have meant less to them in better times they still yearn for.

The debut was rougher than tough and sweeter than shit, but as a genre band they're made for this selective, wide-ranging format. Mad rocker Doug Sahm is no longer a legend outside his place and time, vato vibrato Freddy Fender now remembered as a have-a-nice-day one-shot with a novelty artist's name, but not only were they both major in the bilingual, panstylistic Tex-Mex universe, they ain't oldies now. As for Augie Meyers and Flaco Jimenez, they're born sidemen whose solo albums stand up. In short, any young person who loves good rock and roll, good country, good conjunto, maybe even good polka has a supergroup out there waiting. Try ""Guacamole,"" a great sex metaphor. Or ""Who Were You Thinkin' Of,"" a classic country song. Or ""Wasted Days and Wasted Nights,"" no one-shot.

I suppose it's simplistic to credit friendly neighborhood producer Merrill Garbus with Thao Nguyen's great leap forward from Nguyen's intelligently cheerful indie-rock. But her fifth or seventh album sure does sound like Tune-Yards. Same disquieting harmonies, same hyperactive percussion, same general roil, with Thao's lighter, more unburdened voice delivering darkened lyrics that dwell on her up-and-gone father and ""an endless love"" with an unhappy ending. ""Carve it on out of me,"" she implores again and again. But due to the music, this compulsion sounds like a strength--even a triumph.

For a pop adept, Anna Waronker skimps on the surefire. On no more than half does the chorus come around and grab the ring; on no more than a couple does the verse leave you waiting for the chorus to make its move. But I think that's because she realizes that we're so inured to tunefulness that the surefire backfires. Waronker's deep hooks are a flatly winsome voice, an unsentimental guitar, and a flirty adventurism that promises loving sex without offering much hope she'll be there six months from now--even if she's indulging one of her domestic fantasies at your expense.

With shrieking guitar racing thumpity bass racing headlong drums to the blessed dreamy interludes, this professional Irish garage band exploits an American mode too often neglected over there--they're psychedelic punks who don't know one's supposed to preclude the other. Which doesn't mean they emulate the Count Five, or the Fleshtones either. Having absorbed and assumed twenty more years of noise, they define a sizable new piece of aural turf both conceptually and technically.

Although I'm a known sucker for fast guitar bands, I've turned down hundreds that shall remain nameless. So why do I love these guys? Specifying comes as hard to me as their originality comes easy to them. Except in snatches I can't understand the words, which apparently only add up to snatches anyway. From the press packet I gather that their politics are no more than you'd expect from Northern Ireland, not enough to win me over. And however I shuffle perfectly applicable terms like ""punk"" and ""pop,"" they just won't form a suitable pigeonhole. One thing I notice: in addition to the tunes, which can't put bored music over any more, they're given to scalar guitar hooks that remind me of nothing so much as art-rock ostinatos. In theory, I hate this device. But here it's just another token of smart, untrammeled enthusiasm.

Out of his extended-syllable trick, dollops of falsetto, male backups going hey and stuff, and the good nature of someone who figures there's no point being mean when you're lucky, the guy who wrote ""Umbrella"" fashions an utterly slight, utterly captivating R&amp;B album. True, he pursues other's girls, leaves one shawty because she's not quick enough on the get-down, and moves on to the speedier, needier Nikki when another doesn't immediately accept his tender offer.

As always, Bob Forrest is beset by bad feelings he can't comprehend--about an unjust society, a dysfunctional family, a feminist girlfriend who runs off with ""some faggot from the Posies,"" above all about himself. Crawling around the nice house he secured with his advance or gazing awestruck at the nice girlfriend he doubts he deserves, covering Joan Armatrading or duetting with Tom Waits, sleeping eight to a room in Vegas with his equally confused friends, he always seems to end up doing what he does best--whining. He whines tunefully, loudly, childishly, revoltingly, nakedly, sweetly, intelligently, and though he probably doesn't deserve that girlfriend, you can tell why she doesn't think so. With a jerk like Forrest, this constitutes a major artistic achievement.

Not as peaky as beautiful fuckup Bob Forrest's Bicycle Thief comeback five years ago. If the brief ""The Germs Song"" is ugly and chaotic and the briefer ""The Beck Song"" disses the post-folkie and his haircut, titles like ""The Bob Dylan Song"" and ""The Iggy Stooge Song"" are less evocative than implied.  As for ""The Elton John Song""--well, Elton should cover it, because Forrest needs the money. Throughout this out-of-nowhere record, he and his relaxed band ride an emotional openness and tuneful ease that some pop schemer should convert into accounts receivable. Forrest is glad to be alive because staying that way has been kind of hard. The loveliest of his many lovely moments reaches out in near-tears solidarity to a sad, sexy, solitary salesclerk who wasn't so lucky. Why it's called ""The Big Star Song"" I don't know or care.

The biggest problem with Net-music utopianism is that no matter how fast and convenient downloads get, music itself will continue to exist in, if you'll pardon the expression, real time. That's its very essence. If 1441 minutes of music go up on the Web today, that's a minute more than anyone can hear in that period, period. Might the Net be a useful way for consumers to sample their musical options? Sure. Might it help strapped artists get by? Conceivably. Are there good things there that are unavailable elsewhere? Certainly not as many as in the sum total of specialty shops in our metropolis, although the same may not hold in Wichita. This, however, is one of them. Human song generators whose metier is the miscellany, they're ideally suited to construct a download-only album that isn't an out file taking on airs. Although ""They Got Lost"" is on last year's live album and patrons of their live shows and dial-a-song service may recognize other tunes, this is as enjoyable a CD as they've released in the '90s.

Other multitracks for the ages include ""Zeroes,"" which ""mean so much,"" ""The Number Two,"" about connectedness, ""Apartment Four,"" occupied by a drummer, and ""Infinity,"" which doesn't go on forever though they could have pulled some out-groove trick just to be perverse.

Their pussy song is ""The Oval Office,"" a metaphor so elaborate it may be the first rap inspired by John Donne, and it's not their style to forget that they're white guys moving on a militantly Afrocentric subculture. They equate white racism with leprosy, but irrelevant slanders about monkeys in the Caucasus disgust them as well--""third stage knowledge"" is their program. And in case you think they take themselves too seriously, a Satchmo-voiced interlude assures them, ""You got soul/Comin' out your asshole,"" and notes, ""You're gonna work with a lot of white people think they're black.""

Born in 1941, Thomas had four kids and two husbands behind her by the time of her brief pop run in 1964, but you'd never have known how hard her life had been. She was too busy trying to sing the songs right, and that didn't mean interpreting them, much less infusing them with her own experience--it meant nailing a commercial sound. Blessed with a surpassingly warm voice even for New Orleans, she took more naturally to the cockeyed optimism Allen Toussaint can't repress than to the darker moods of the early soul songs she tried. But just to be on the safe side she put happy and sad into everything, as on Toussaint's oh so hummable ""Take a Look""--which comes out far more serious and sincere, and hence effective, than the wedding-day bliss of its lyric requires. It's her tractability before strong material--better chosen here than on EMI's already deleted 1992 best-of (""Volume 1,"" ha)--that makes her so winsome. And it was her determination to please that eventually turned her into a blatantly ordinary local institution. Believe me--she was more interesting when she didn't know what she was doing.

Riding the rhythmic and presentational developments, tendencies, and fads of a stylistic catchall that's signified many things over many decades, he put his name on a whole bunch of terrific highlife singles, most of them in English.

With a firm hand, the man from Lake Wobegon sets them straight. His Joplin doesn't rock, swing, or anything like it.

Most folk-rock succeeds only in accentuating the irretrievability of the past, but the Thompsons' hard-nosed Sufi fatalism delivers them from nostalgia. When they sing about getting ""to the border,"" they're talking about dying, not smuggling weed from Mexico, and they make the crossing sound like an earthly triumph (""drowned in a barrel of wine"" indeed).

Near as I can tell, divides his first solo album since 1972's passing strange Henry the Human Fly between the four songs on side one that bid a poisoned farewell to his tear-stained wife and the four songs on side two that praise her replacement for saving his life before warning her not to toy with his affections and criticizing her dancing. Rocking in that blocky Morris-dance manner, but distinctly contemporary, these could be passing stranger. They're of such uniformly excellent quality, however, that even Warren Zevon, say, will be hard-pressed to top them in 1983. Gosh.

FALSE,A-,Amnesia,Richard Thompson,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2947,"
Often impressed and rarely interested by his solo years, I sat up for ""Don't Tempt Me,"" which opens side two in a persona-fied outburst of uproarious jealousy: ""That's not a dance, that's S-E-X/Ban that couple, certificate X!"" Followed by ""Yankee Go Home,"" summing up 43 years of Anglo-American relations in one mixed historical metaphor. Whereupon I could contemplate subtler innovations--lead cut with a hook, political lyric with a point. Plus the usual twisted love songs and shitload of guitar.

The second Thompson is bassist Danny, the instrumental interludes of whose North of England jazz-march unit Whatever set off Richard's six songs in the manner of Charlie Haden or Kurt Weill--with music that intensifies meaning as well as sustaining mood. The songs themselves, all of which attend closely to the title concept, were researched in dying coal mines and the Karl Marx library, among other places, and let's hope they convince Richard that art is 90 per cent perspiration. It does him a world of good to get out of himself.

FALSE,A-,Record,Tracey Thorn,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17277,"
Calm, deliberate, undemonstrative, Thorn is a singer some find magical and others prosaic. I've always tended other, but when a 55-year-old wife and mother claims she's recorded ""nine feminist bangers,"" I pay attention. And these definitely work up some fairy dust. The beats evoke without mimicking the subtle electro-dance of Thorn and her beatmaking husband Ben Watt's 20th-century band, Everything but the Girl, and in her undemonstrative way, she sequences the catchiest tracks last: ""Face,"" about checking out your ex at Mark Zuckerberg's place, and ""Dance,"" which namechecks ""Good Times,"" ""Shame,"" ""Golden Years,"" and ""Let the Music Play."" In four other songs, decent but fundamentally clueless guys mess with various women's lives, while two others evoke a motherhood you assume is autobiographical. In ""Babies,"" ""Get the fuck to bed now"" is closely followed by ""Baby love you even more."" In ""Go,"" which takes place quite a few years later, she knows the kid has to leave--that's the reason she put in all that work.

FALSE,A-,I'll Be Easy to Find,Teri Thornton,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3440,"
A veteran of polio, cancer, incarceration, and cabdriving whose perfect pitch and three-octave range were getting raves when she was in her twenties, Thornton transfigures the showboating artiness that puts pop fans off jazz singers. Since I've lived happily without Sarah Vaughan and Abbey Lincoln, at first I didn't trust my pleasure in the soulful concentration, harmonic subtlety, and deliciously curdled timbre of Thornton's first record since 1963. But from her self-composed blues to her rearranged ""Lord's Prayer,"" her occasional piano to her consistent standards, this woman knows how to serve a song her way. If she's making something of ""It Ain't Necessarily So"" and ""Nature Boy"" at this late date, it's only because she's waited a long, long time.

What pushes this Nashville cowgrrlcore trio past the cutesy two-steps and over-the-hills strums of their brief professional yore is the male drummer who turned them into a quartet. But I bet the Casio that marks track one as not-country was their idea--and that, actually, so was the drummer. Because this album's great leap forward is hooky, saucy, punky songwriting in a mood somewhere between Be Your Own Pet and the Donnas, only savvier: ""Be Your Bro,"" which may not sum up their platonic feelings for that drummer but could, or ""Hives,"" proving they do too get the itch, or ""Boy,"" in which love on the road needn't be permanent to be nice. They have mouths on them, yes they do. But their mouths are connected to their hearts and minds, and amped by loud guitars.

I enjoy imaginary soundtracks as much as (hell, more than) the next guy, and often adjudge entertaining fake jazz aesthetically superior to proficient real jazz. So let this album stand as a reminder--the most striking of several current examples I could name, with others no doubt languishing unheard on my shelves--that when jazz isn't just proficient it can cut. Threadgill blows more horn than John Lurie, Roy Nathanson, and Peter Gordon combined. In the past his third-stream expeditions have sometimes dragged, but ""Theme from Thomas Cole"" can be in my movie anytime. His avant gets over on force of personality. And he can play the blues.

Doomy politics, detached declamations, Leeds connection--they're the Gang of Three, obviously, and if they're not as smart, so be it. No funk crossovers for them--the drums are sure to pick up pattern and accent, but their genius is for basic (and unnostalgic) rock and roll of a purity rarely heard outside punk, if indeed that's where its located. This time the songs are there, even though the analysis isn't terribly smart either. (That ain't America, lads, it's Capital.) And, considering how much good smarts did the Go4, maybe we should be grateful it's rancor and sarcasm that make them go.

The rare repertoire album with a future, because there's no stink of the canon about it. Russell Thompkins Jr. and Ted Mills are remembered as oddballs if at all--although you, gentle reader, of course recognize them as the falsetto leads of the Stylistics and Blue Magic. But together, their nearly intact voices--Thompkins' buttery, Mills' supple--actualize an out-of-this-world tenderness that's a promise, not an escape, with Delfonic William Hart designated as third wheel. Curated by MFSB guitarist Bobby Eli, the songs are equally pristine--certified hits by Isley-Jasper-Isley and the Brothers Gibb, AWB and EWF, Dionne Warwick and Hall &amp; Oates, but the average rock history buff will be lucky to recognize them, never mind following through with IDs. Granted, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame could ruin this yet. And I say, let it try.

From Detroit, a brother team over a rhythm section that's growing muscles, and though Scott Allen's keyboards provide the abundant hooks, Ryan Allen defines the sound. His voice high and desperate, his guitar jagged, Ryan has trust issues, but they're social--there's not a single relationship song on what is formally a high-anxiety pop record. ""The things that people say/The way that people talk/Make me want to take the words right out of their mouths,"" he yelps, then ventures: ""This is why we war."" Maybe not--not exclusively, anyway. But it's exciting that he cares.

FALSE,A-,Paper Trail,T.I.,2008,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14272,"
Determined to provide for his dependents during 2009's scheduled downtime, Atlanta's favorite convicted phenom bids subcultural purism goodbye, augmenting King's steamroller anthems with all the hooks we can eat, putting the words on paper before delivery. After three impressive ""What You Want"" rips, the third of which exploits moral confusions he would never have copped to when he was king, he buries the hatchet with Ludacris, whose rhymes bury his, but who's keeping score? Then it's on to a ""Numa Numa Dance"" sample foreshadowing the ""Paper Planes"" sample to come, an obliging sex boast soon converted by YouTube schoolkids into a get-out-the-vote ditty, a chant about designer headscarves, a walk around the block with Usher and Justin Timberlake. He proves he belongs on the same record as Jay, Wayne, and Kanye by hiring them to rhyme in on ""Swagga Like Us,"" which cleans out the taste of ""Every Chance I Get,"" the only misogynist braggadocio on an album that swaggas as a matter of principle. Hip-hop's amoral guardians may bitch and moan. But if you can't get with this expediently excessive piece of rich-get-richer, commercial rap albums are beyond your ken.

FALSE,A-,Us or Else: Letter to the System,T.I.,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16959,"
In an odd move commercially but a fortuitous one culturally, the well-fixed ex-felon absorbs all six tracks of the political EP he dropped in September into a doubly unexpected 15-track album. The new songs are no stronger than the old ones and never top the Killer Mike throwdown ""40 Acres""; they make room for the regrettable hook ""You know why you broke you niggaz is lazy"" and the provocative refrain ""Pain just a weakness when it leavin' the body."" Yet the bubble-funk of the opener eases its iconoclasm down, the tongue-in-cheek patriotism of ""That's my story and I'm stickin' to it"" adds cred to the title track's Black Lives Matter, and the don't-trap-like-I-did admonitions gain cred by association. Between its timing, its heft, and its complexity, the whole is more than equal to the sum of its parts.

In the late '40s, the warped pitch of the singer-composer-guitarist who damn near invented both honky-tonk and cheating songs evoked a fiddle the way Robert Plant's shriek would evoke an electric guitar two decades later. Unfortunately, this collection includes only three of the seven classics Willie Nelson mentions in his brief liner notes (and also skips ""It Makes No Difference Now"") in favor of some fairly humdrum collectors' items. Nor is his deleted 1975 best-of a whole lot more complete. And yet both are fine albums. The two songs they share--""Slipping Around"" and the painful ""I Love You So Much It Hurts""--are as definitively country as anything you'll ever hear, and collectors' items like ""Sentenced to a Life (Without You)"" and ""I'm Checkin' Out on You"" shoulda been contenders. So until he gets what he deserves, this will do.

In fact, he's so uncompromising about being laid-back that he finds himself charged with no less a responsibility than redefining reality, which in his unorthodox view is benign, within limits: ""I got my man Big D./Rodney/In case somebody wanna rob me."" Magoo does the Flavor Flav thing, leaving Tim free to keep the self-referential rhymes as clean as they wanna be: ""I'm on my last verse/As you can see I did not curse/I wanna make it radio-friendly/So people in America can hear me."" He's woman-friendly too--won't call you a ho, just lick on your toes.

Good thing the two rappers have less personality combined than any of their 10-cameo-artists-in-16-tracks, because personality would distract from the beats, which with Timbo means what it says--no mainstream DJ relies so heavily on rhythm instruments per se. His sweetener of choice is chants--Tim, Mag, &amp; Attitude re-singing Peter, Paul &amp; Mary's ""Leaving on a Jet Plane,"" Actual South Asian Person Raje Shwari softening a unison mutter of ""That Sh** Ain't Gonna Work""--that cloy only with the standard-issue femme hooks toward the end (sure we miss Aaliyah, but Brandy makes it worse). Magoo's best line: ""I don't own a plane or yacht or eat squid."" Tim's (to Shwari, not Magoo): ""I can't understand a word you're saying.""

He's one giant step ahead of his audience, just like always, and though his talent and character were there for all to see, who knew he'd turn out this heady or beatwise? Maybe his mom, or his manager--a woman and an African American, respectively. There's plenty of Neptunes records, but none as nice; plenty of Timbaland records, but none as sexy. Tagging the lead track, he sums up his growth curve in six simple words that, somehow, no one ever thought of before: ""Gentlemen, good night. Ladies, good mornin'."" Then, as if he wasn't already in the door, he gooses the play with a relieved, knowing, friendly chuckle. Five straight hook tracks at the beginning are topped in the end by lubricious Janet and experimental Timbo. Any jerk who disses the awkwardness with which Justin calls out ""Drums!"" or gets guys and gals trading come-hithers should have been half as coltish at 21. He can still make *NSync records if he wants--the Brian McKnight mawk proves it. But if he does, it'll be out of the goodness of his heart.

Pat Macdonald and his wife Barbara K. are outsiders who don't make a big thing of it--not weirdos, really, just observers. Like most satirists they're strongest when they get inside their targets, as with the going-places nuclear science major who sings the hit, but they're capable of a certain sidelong lyricism, and Pat's way with words stays with him even when he's indulging in invective: ""Just another jerk taking pride in his work,"" pretty nasty. The music is basically traditional, not averse to partying r&amp;b licks, but appropriately detached. Also appropriately, Pat and Barbara play and sing every note on the thing.

""Wild and Loose"" pops wilder and looser than anything they've cut, and their dogging-around jive is wilder and looser still--on ""The Walk,"" Morris Day does an outrageous burlesque of Prince as pussy-stalking youngblood, an inside version of one of the cutesy-pie jokes the little boss plays on himself to prove he's human.

Piecing together an EP that looks (and probably is) every bit as casual as the rest of her solo noncareer, the old Mekon and new kid-TV star surveys fake authenticity at its weedlike best, from John Anderson's comeback-album title song to ""Long Black Veil,"" which may just be the greatest phony folk song of all time--with Nashville punsters, No Depression punters, and ""Tennessee Waltz"" betwixt and between.

These Tuaregs never get loud. Their tempos are deliberate, their sonics indigenous; their percussion comprises a single derbouka drum and some handclaps, and their chants eschew showmanship. Not that they're above reaching out, or marketing--they consciously costume themselves as desert exotics. But rarely has such a compelling electric-guitar band offered less rock and roll release. Even when they're inventing Sahara rap their goal is contained self-sufficiency--a principled nostalgia for the community that has been wrested from them.

Most Saharan music--by the women of Tartit, the phantoms who groan and ululate in and out of the Rough Guide and Festival in the Desert collections--slips as easily into the background as any other modern African subgenre. These militants are less ingratiating. The spiritual gravity of their melodies and grooves demands your attention without offering to reward it--what's sought isn't your affection but your respect. But give them time and eventually affection and even awe will follow--for the guitar line that opens the record, the call-and-response that follows the guttural intro to Track 4, the chorus that rises up out of Track 7. Study the booklet and discover that the subject of all three songs is the privations of exile. Perhaps you'd prefer something a little more upful--""Tamatant Tilay,"" say? Translation on that one: ""We kill the enemies and become like eagles/We'll liberate all those who live in the plains."" And it's not a metaphor.

The first Saharans to break internationally are forbidding even by the sere standards of the region. But they calm rather than mesmerize, which together with some subtly shameless showmanship helps sell them to peace-out types. Having found 2009's widely praised and supposedly ""traditional"" Imidiwan too lulling by half, which may be because I joined the caravan before Pitchfork and Entertainment Weekly and is definitely because they should rock out a little, I was disappointed to learn that this one is where they abandon electric guitars. But since there's never been any Agadez ax-god abandon about headman Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, the difference is marginal, especially given the help they've gathered on their first album for Epitaph's alt-trad label: Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone on guitar and/or vocals on five of the 12 tracks, Dirty Dozen Brass Band on a sixth. The collaborations are subtle but telling, as are Alhabib's deep melodies. Not ""desert blues."" Sadder than blues--too sad to be merely calming.

Less than a year ago at the Bouffes du Nord, an elegantly refurbished old venue barely two miles from the bohemian Bataclan, the world's most renowned Malian musicians put on a show for a mixed audience of Christians, Muslims, and rank unbelievers.

Ditched by RCA during a preemptive 1999 downsizing, he opened a convenience store-gun shop while awaiting the chance to unleash his grandiose, jingoistic ""Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly,"" eventually a big hit for George W. Bush and Hollywood Records. But this decline need not concern us here. The latest and best of four competing BMG collections shows off Tippin's serrated high edge, impolite drawl, and unchurched ways. The songs earn titles like ""Working Man's Ph.D.,"" ""Honky-Tonk Superman,"" ""She Feels Like a Brand New Man Tonight,"" and ""There Ain't Nothing Wrong With the Radio"" (about a car, not the radio). ""My Blue Angel"" and Billy Swan's ""I Can Help"" argue his romantic side, and so does ""A Door,"" I guess.

Their debut was one of those inexplicable accidents in which some dysfunction-channeling young malcontent recaptures the halcyon days when every punk band had something to say by simple virtue of existing. Usually these malcontents run out of jokes or tunes pretty quick. Seldom if ever do they then channel their dysfunction into, for instance, a concept album that squooshes an interstate breakup saga into a bunch of Civil War references. That's New Jersey returnee Patrick Stickles's project, only channeling is for punks and he's some indigenous emo-Springsteen hybrid--for an hour of rant and roll whose nine tracks range up to 14 minutes, it's more like sloshing or spewing, as intermittent love lookbacks evoke a social despair also contextualized by fabulous spoken epigraphs from Walt Whitman, Jefferson Davis, William Lloyd Garrison, and Young Abe Lincoln. In their spirit Stickles bellows, ""None of us shall be saved, every man will be a slave,"" ""After ten thousand years it's still us against them,"" ""The enemy is everywhere."" You could complain that these cris de coeur are a loser feeling sorry for himself, and I could admit he's overstating. But at least he's stating. He may be a loser and he may not.

In the first full-length by this Toronto band most would still call young, David Monks' falling melodies and blurred lyrical memories capture this poignancy in 11 songs that wedge perturbed postpunk guitar and keyboard into punky two-and-a-half-minute songs.

They're playing for their contemporaries, who apparently have not a care in the world except those that proceed naturally from play. This adds up to plenty of cares--romantic complexity, sibling rivalry, coming home wasted in the middle of the night, etc. So lest anyone get bummed, they've gotten more generous with their tunes.

Because he's never cultivated a deep reggae pocket, tumbling naturally into a rocksteady groove even with Sly &amp; Robbie, the programming doesn't jar as it skips from 1969 to 1976 to 1980.

This rocksteady diehard's 1968 ""Do the Reggay"" named a groove he was too constitutionally uptempo ever to get into; this unspoiled journeyman's soul affinities endeared him to hippie diehards and failed to touch young African Americans, who by the mid-'70s figured the soul that was passe when it came from the South must be pure shuck-and-jive if it came from the islands. So eager to please that only 1988's patently nostalgic Toots in Memphis ever showed the courage of his conceptions, he was also too songful ever to come up dry. I can think of things I miss, such as the heartily discomfiting ""Famine."" But this is the testament of Otis Redding's love child. His eagerness is a natural force. And his pleasures abide.

Tosh's prime was over long before he was murdered in 1987, probably for being the stoned, arrogant gadfly-cum-crank he turned into. By cherry-picking his 1976 and 1977 Columbia albums, culling two Rolling Stones keepers, adding three worthy oddments, and preserving EMI's 1981 ""Fools Die"" just in case anybody thinks I'm kidding about far downhill he slid, this showcases the Wailers' only born propagandist. You love Bob Marley, I love Bob Marley, but he didn't venture social statements as hard-hitting, verbally or musically, as ""Equal Rights"" or ""Legalize It."" Righteous militance rarely wears well. That Tosh could have done this much with it is worth writing down.

Though his name doesn't grace the press release and he doesn't join Tuareg militant Moussa Ag Keyna and Keyna's female cousin Aminatou Goumar on the cover, what distinguishes this desert trance-rock from other desert trance-rock is French film-dance-theater composer Dan Levy, who produced, arranged, engineered, mixed and played 10 instruments on its debut album. Real World has always gone for ""accessibility,"" but in a style this austere, some subtle schlock is a good thing. Rather than Tartit or Tinariwen, neither of whom eschew the theatrical themselves, this is the Tuareg music I'll play for friends after they've had their fill of Rough Guide to the Music of the Sahara.

His riffs have that circular Malian thrills-you-or-not thing, although the intonation is exceptionally plummy and the fingerwork always impeccable. But listen up and you'll also hear Western-style tasty licks-saved from themselves by the circular Malian thrills-you-or-not thing. Choral singing--female, male, and both--clinches the beauty part.

As a self-taught guitarist who's rarely reviewed without reference to John Lee Hooker, Toure is conflicted about Afro-American music--does he owe it or does it owe him? And although he always displays the guitar style that occasions the comparison (which I'm betting is part influence, part tradition, and part invention), his recordings drift into the folkloric. So it's a relief that unlike Mango's Ali Farka Toure or Shanachie's African Blues, this one means to cross over a bit. Not only does it make room for a second human being (Amadou Cisse on calabash, the percussion device that Toure overdubs on his Mango release), but tracks colored with harmonica, saxophone, fiddle and bodhran, and the single-stringed njarka that Toure picks up for the finale--not to mention an extra edge of vocal command. I don't know what Malians will think. But I say the result is variety, not compromise. And I say it's what he's always needed.

In Mali a little goes a long way, so after his harrowing experience with Ry Cooder's sense of rhythm the artfully primeval guitarist-vocalist took his modest winnings back to the well-named title village, where he devoted himself to making green things grow. Finally, after five years, he surrounds himself entirely with homeboys and reemerges with a""full of important messages for Africans."" Over here he doesn't ""expect people to understand,"" and of course we don't.

He's not a bluesman either. Is there an African who is? But it's a tribute to his raising that Vieux takes to internationalism more easily than the ambitious genius who oversaw his upbringing, getting his groove on with a mostly African band anchored and often defined by American drummer Tim Keiper and juiced up just enough by spot-on spots from Derek Trucks, John Scofield, and Dave Matthews--and also his father's last session before heading off to die in a French hospital. Palpably less austere than Ali, Vieux is known to do Hendrix shtick onstage, and his 2010 live album is showier than is advisable outside a show.

The weak link is the popmeister up top--Toussaint has always been the least improvisational and also the least percussive of the New Orleans piano masters. But Nicholas Payton, Don Byron, and Marc Ribot provide all the jazz he needs. Absolutely this not-quite-lite tour of New Orleans and vicinity touches down on Bechet and Morton, ""St. James Infirmary"" and ""West End Blues."" But it defines vicinity so broadly that you'll also find Beiderbecke and Reinhardt, two Ellington tunes, songs by a jazz critic and Ed Sullivan's bandleader. And bringing the album home is the not especially canonical Thelonious Monk title track, where percussiveness is a man's only option and everybody is compelled to improvise some, the percussionist included.

So much so that some of this music is a little lightweight--expressing the kind of undiscriminating joy in the everyday one might expect from somebody who considers ""You always were, you always are, and you always will be"" both a profound sentiment and a snappy way to finish off a concept album. But I'm encouraged that Ronnie Lane (singer-songwriter on ""Evolution"") offers a drink (alcohol, get it?) to the Master and his Truth. And in the end the homely sweetness and frailty of his music prevails.

Rainy Season Blues is one of those solo acoustic sitdowns that authenticity fetishists pine for and I'm too crass to get through twice when the songs are in English. This is the opposite--loud, electric band jams from a late-night club in an early-to-bed city and ""a well-known Nigerian 'Hotel,'"" whatever that means. I do ask myself why I'm more likely to enjoy the form from the number five Malian guitarist than from, say, Jeff Beck. Intensity of self-creation, partly, plus I remain a big Hound Dog Taylor fan. Traore cuts Taylor.

Harrison's the only lead guitarist; Lynne plays not piano or Hammond B-3 but a marooned synthesizer; Orbison and Harrison take solo turns on songs that obviously belong on their own sorry albums. Yet from Harrison's hook on ""Margarita"" to the ridiculous ride-your-automobile metaphors of ""Dirty World,"" this is the fun get-together it's billed as--somebody was letting his hair down, that's for sure.

For another three songs, a decent level of musical amenity is maintained: Martina's crooning tale of woe underpinned by low-register guitar/keyb riffs of unspecified origin and Calvin Weston's free drumming, three-note distorto hook beneath Tricky's speed-mumble, xylophonish tinkle countered by a keyb belch like an engine that won't catch. Thereafter the residues of grimy technologies settle into permanent low-level disorder: foghorns lowing, brakes complaining, clocks sounding across windswept nights, locomotives struggling uphill.

That's still 2002's criminally neglected Blowback, available as I write used and domestic for under a buck or new and imported for 45 of 'em. The thematic attack here is pretty surgical, cutting most of the time to the gangsta life he's so glad he sidestepped as a youth. The individual pieces are well-defined by his muzzy standards. And the usual lineup of vocal guests you never heard of--in this case Kingston hard Terry Lynn, London patois-slinger Blackman, Tricky's reformed little brother Marlon, Bobby (from Primal Scream, you remember), and most prominently Irish-Italian belle Frankie Riley--certainly stick up for themselves. But things only get catchy when an Arabic speaker who turns out to be Rachid Taha's guitarist--not even backup singer!--grabs the album by the throat and is followed by Riley taking up a ""big underground tune"" from when Tricky was a teen.

Crucially, this reboot of vocalist-lyricist-guitarist Gareth Liddiard's Perth-spawned, Melbourne-based, Canberra-averse Drones, who earned grunge-retro renown in their politically dysfunctional land without ever breaking Stateside, leans on three women: guitarist-keyboardist Erica Dunn, drummer Lauren Hammel, and former Drones bassist Fiona Kitschin, without whose shading and amplification the frontman's sociohistorical ravings might evoke a woke Nick Cave flexing his baritone. Although Socrates' hemlock meets Jesus' crucifixion and ""The Future of History"" details Gary Kasparov's 1997 defeat by a computer, the history part is seldom head-on. But whether the subject is family of assholes in legal trouble they deserve or plywood houses that should be armor-plated, Liddiard's songs are more sociopolitically situated than less verbose types generally manage, plus there's a Trump number where an Oompa Loompa brandishes drones and nukes.

After nearly 50 years on the road, though, his two ""live"" albums were applause-added phonies, so this posthumous find is something new. Cut by an engineer friend when Tubb was 51 (not so bad when you consider that he rerecorded his compilations for stereo and full rhythm section in his mid-forties), it documents a show that evolved but never really changed--unhurried, genial, skipping from Tubb standards to chart fare to honky-tonk classics to band features to climax with his first and greatest hit, ""Walkin' the Floor Over You."" Reliable, reassuring, the man who invented honky-tonk belies truisms about how great pop music is always passionate or urgent or necessary. And sounds weird as hell.

Snotnoses who think Hank and Lefty make them country fans won't believe how slow, flat, and sentimental the first honky tonker was. And though except for one hymn these 16 selections were all hits, there are livelier and more poetic possibilities that might help dilettantes comprehend his primal unflappability. Then again, so would a quick listen to Red Foley, who wasn't Pat Boone's father-in-law for nothing. Every genre needs an acid test. You may never be the same.

FALSE,A-,Kill My Blues,The Corin Tucker Band,2012,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15777,"
After the feminist scolding cum rallying cry, my favorites are the happy love songs, every one about a marriage that has no time for the fantasy that wedlock is boring and may even wish it was sometimes: a health scare, an emotional rupture, a vacation they need every mile and minute of. Mourning Joey Ramone and clearing emotional space for her infant daughter, she's slightly slower and considerably more melodramatic, as is only appropriate. Other times the melodrama appears merely the organic outcome of a larger-than-life voice.

FALSE,A-,I Spent a Week There the Other Night,Moe Tucker,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2437,"
Tucker's genius as the found drummer in the greatest of all bohemian bands was knowing the shortest distance between two points, and she maintained the knack as a divorced mother of five who couldn't make ends meet working for a Wal-Mart in Douglas, Georgia. It's rare enough for any artist to give this American archetype its due; when the archetype turns artist, it's a gift from the pop muse. Backed by a claque that includes John Cale and two Violent Femmes on these 1991 sessions, the self-taught rhythm guitarist lays down a crude, almost skeletal rock and roll that never suggests anything so highfalutin as minimalism and says what she has to say about poverty, sloth, shyness, and the idiocy of provincial life. There's also a love song to a daughter who has trouble loving back. And an ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" that's pure found minimalism.

FALSE,A-,Nikki Nack,tUnE-yArDs,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16281,"
Where Merrill Garbus's contemporaries pro and con hear a boldly experimental self-expresser/cultural appropriator, I've always slotted her as a hyperconscious, hyperemotional misfit with a long-gone weight problem and a generous voice. From the start she's extracted her exhilaration from an insecurity that sounded hard for her to bear. I've encountered many such people in my life, most of them not too deeply--they're hard to take. But because they're so hyper they make excellent early warning systems and political consciences. Some may wonder why two different songs fret about the water supply. I believe it's because she lives in California, end of story. Some may wonder why she devotes an entire track to four lines about a rocking chair. I imagine it's because she became self-conscious about breaking it and composed the song in the ensuing insomnia. Somewhat more overwrought than its predecessors, this album is harder to take as a result. But it's also hookier and more clearly recorded. And as a musical sensor she has few peers.
"
FALSE,A-,I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life,tUnE-yArDs,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17330,"
Merrill Garbus has a gift for embarrassing people, especially by caring so deeply about the unpackable racial complexities her music has always addressed head on. It's these complexities she's now chastised for making a mess of in a time-slip when African-Americans have earned the right to charge appropriation whenever white musicians venture into racial territory, which is such a relief to the many white people eager to let things ride. On an album marked by the theme statements ""I must be witness to everything,"" ""Honesty, honesty gone / Don't know right from wrong,"" and ""I know I'm not to be trusted,"" she acknowledges more white guilt than she's probably incurred, so of course sometimes she's clumsy about it. Who isn't? But with decisive input from bassist-lifemate Nate Brenner, her musicality--smoother here, perhaps due to the black-pop softeners some reviewers descry--remains something to believe in. Proud against her better judgment, she can't stop exploring her art or living her life. ""Sitting in the middle of the Sixth Extinction / Silently suggesting the investment in a generator,"" she gives no sign she'll ever stop flailing away at everything that makes her crazy and compels her to sing.

Even by Kansas City standards, Turner was pretty primal. The aspiring urbanity of Jimmy Rushing and Jimmy Witherspoon didn't suit him--he's a whale out of water in the big-band settings his Rhino triple is forever upgrading to. Here he hollers and moans over boogie-woogie piano--especially Pete Johnson, but also, and differently, Meade Lux Lewis, Willie ""The Lion"" Smith, Albert Ammons, even Art Tatum--and combos playing de facto jump blues. Broke as the Ten Commandments or taking jockey lessons because he ain't no monkey man, he's a country bluesman with a jazzman's phrasing and a bad mother fuyer's certainty of his own endangered prerogatives.

Hardly the last major rock and roller to brutalize women, Turner gets short-changed by history partly because his best-known victim was so major herself and partly because his specialty was collaboration. Sadly, Rhino's licensing whizzes failed to secure his Federal sides, depriving us of both his rawest singer--Billy Gayles, the real Screamin' Jay Hawkins--and his most primordial guitar. And leaving a lean, mean bandleader whose ear for the permanent novelty only began with ""Rocket `88'""--as did everything else.

Seven early-'60s hits, two or three of them classic, constitute their authentic stage. Then there's a hiatus when they record for at least four other labels (cf. Tomato's typically patchy Great Rhythm &amp; Blues Sessions quote unquote). Then there are Beatles, Stones, and Sly covers, followed by Eki Renrut's ""Workin' Together,"" followed by the Creedence cover that breaks them pop. After which they return to authenticity at a higher (that is, less authentic) level of consciousness, like ""Funkier Than a Mosquita's Tweeter"" and their second-biggest pop record, ""Nutbush City Limits,"" which reached number 22. Excellent stuff in general, don't get me wrong. But legendary? This woman really knew how to show off her legs.

Tina is more convincing when she's growling out Ike's songs about her sexual appetites (I sure couldn't handle her) than when she's belting out Ike's songs about the social fabric (""Why can't we be happy like we used to be""). She's also more convincing when she's growling out a Stones song about her sexual appetites than when she's belting out a Sly Stone song about the social fabric. Still, their vogue has been good for their music--the level of effort here is so high that the sole throwaway works as a coda and brings the record back down. And the rock covers take some strain off Ike--especially when Tina sings a Beatles song that's about both her sexual appetites and the social fabric.

Her voice was shot even before she split with Ike, ten years ago now, and videotaped evidence belied the dazzled reports that filtered in from the faithful when she began her comeback, two and a half years ago now. Less than converted by her reverent reading of the Reverend Green's ""Let's Stay Together,"" I noted cynically that the album lists four different production teams, always a sign of desperation. Which makes its seamless authority all the more impressive. The auteur is Tina, who's learned to sing around and through the cracks rather than shrieking helplessly over them, and who's just sophisticated (or unsophisticated) enough to take the middlebrow angst of contemporary professional songwriting literally. Also personally--check out how she adapts the printed lyrics of Paul Brady's ""Steel Claw"" to her own spoken idiom.

This respects literal chronology even less than the movie, which has her doing ""Proud Mary"" before Creedence released it. But there's a logic to the willy-nilly segues--in which, for instance, two glossily intelligent new products of her pop-diva phase, the thematic ""I Don't Wanna Fight"" and the pneumatic ""Why Must We Wait Until Tonight?,"" flank B.B. King's 1964 ""Rock Me Baby"" and the Trammps' 1978 ""Disco Inferno,"" neither of which has ever had her name on it before. In essence, she's reenacting her career as timeless myth, submitting every brilliant exploit and humiliating compromise to the unmatched lust and lustre of her 54-year-old pipes. She's never sounded more beautiful or more alive. Or more enigmatic--it's as impossible as ever to glimpse what she might be like in ""real life,"" or even to pin down an artistic appeal that at this point seems to inhere in the raw fact of her survival. As for the sex, it's more abstract and calculated than ever. And right--love has nothing to do with it.

Proud foe of prog, poetasters and their debut album, I filed this under overwrought 'til I could bear the clamor of their youthful cohort no longer, and soon I was sucker-punched by its opening salvo, four sour treated-horns-with-sitar notes that remain the best thing on the record, immediately followed by the second-best thing, Tunde Adebimpe's pained falsetto ""I was a lover before this war."" Together, these are enough to justify the record's ominous tone. Though hardly straightforward, neither music nor lyrics are obscure. Instead, emotional dislocations are contextualized for once--blamed on Bush and/or capitalism, actually, which rather than a cop out is almost an analysis. Never rousing and too often glum, the album is carried by its intelligence, integrity and terrible beauty. Difficult but durable music and point but open-ended verbiage that conveys what a bummer it is to struggle fruitlessly with your own political impotence.

The rumor that this is their love album will come as news to the woman who let him go and the woman who thinks they're incompatible and maybe even the woman whose heart he's gonna keep when the world falls apart. Not to mention the mother robbed blind and the fish washed up on the shore and the blues that keeps him on the shelf and the megaquake that's a force of nature and maybe even the killer crane that's not a piece of malfunctioning construction equipment. Because these guys were lovers before this war, a ceaselessly shifting conflict that has dominated their entire artistic life, love has always been part of their coping mechanism. But it'll obviously never be as big for them as music. In this iteration, that music is a trifle gentler and several times encourages dancing on the floor you've been knocked to. But it remains set on complexity, contemplation, and the interactions of art-rock texture, pan-rock rhythm, and African falsetto. Beautiful, especially if you like your beauty grand. And beauty is good. But how about some jokes? Jokes help people get through wars too.

Big on love myself, I nonetheless wince at the borderline banality of ""Could You"" and ""Test Pilot,"" when love goes poorly. But when love goes well--on ""Quartz,"" ""Ride,"" the delicate, muscular ""Careful You""--they're strong of mind, body, and spirit.

They're not about to revolutionize JA--not by carpentering the bass lines, horn charts, and dub effects of the reggae of yesteryear (1975, say) into an indigenous pop r&amp;b. And though they have their own DIY label, they're not about to revolutionize their native U.K. either. But their conscience is catching--I know, because I fell for ""One in Ten"" on Radio Luxembourg despite my objections to its merely liberal message. Their toasting is pretty infectious too.

And the statistical metaphor it draws does seem a little less grim now. But good politics are rarely grim, and though I've loved ""One in Ten"" since the first time I heard it, this is the version I'll put on, if only because Chrissie makes such a soulful Cher.

You can tell this Next Hendrix stuff is getting serious when Ulmer, always more an improviser/composer than a singer/songwriter, makes like a romantic heavy and musical philosophizer. Yet despite his grizzled visage and mouthful of marbles, he's getting away with it. As with Hendrix, his singing and thinking both seem crude at first, as do the simplified bottom of Calvin Weston and Amin Ali. But in the end the force of the conception, and of the sound itself, turn all doubts around.

Yet this is the only one whose tempo shifts and horn lines and sudden bursts of ugly are as funny as they should be, more on this '93 Europe/'96 US release than the more theatrical '91 Europe/'97 US Unloved World. And what ever happened to Pulnoc, who could make a fella like serious?

Young twentysomethings who write about what they know--college. Liberal arts majors broad-minded enough to worry that ""ion displacement won't work in the basement,"" they took their Columbia studies seriously, which is my idea of how to exploit privilege (though how much privilege is less self-evident than Ivy-hatas assume). Hence all the flags about appropriated exotica, class distinctions and cultural capital--and the not unrelated correct accents, designer brands and vacation retreats. Their chief thematic concern is whether there's life after graduation, and rather than Afropop, from which they misprise a guitar sound but nothing of the groove it was conceived to serve, their music, as with most fresh recent bands good and bad, is quite Euro. Affecting a clarity and delight that pleases the many and confounds the some, their lyrically alluring, structurally hop-skip-and-jumping songs aren't deep. They're just thoughtful fun. And now let me give it up to an I Love Music post by Pitchfork's Scott Plagenhoef: ""off-kilter, upbeat guitar pop, with--in comparison to their peers--something singular about both their music (e.g. not just the touches of African pop but the willingness to use space and let the songs breathe a bit) and their lyrics (detail-heavy, expressive; too bad they're images of wealth instead of poverty, otherwise they'd be critical manna)."" Right on, my brother.

Vandross is without question the decade's premier pop (forget ""black"" pop) singer, and this figured to be where he beats Marcus Miller's straitjacket beats and drummed not hummed past his own humdrum songwriting. It is, too--by about an inch and a half. I know it may only be me, but what do the ladies hear in his slow ones? The quiet sheen of his timbre is distinctive and luxurious, a cross between power and velvet--like male Dionne Warwick. But I swear his voice isn't as beautiful as El DeBarge's or Al Green's, and beyond his trademark niceness, all caring and credulous, he's emotionally unreadable. As a result, showstopping tours de feeling like ""A House Is Not a Home"" and ""Superstar"" are as incomprehensible to the uninitiated as his d.o.a. Gregory Hines duet. But on his catchiest dance songs, including every one here, he embodies the long-forgotten disco synthesis of comfort and energy. And the medium-tempo stuff is anonymous pop at its most personable.

FALSE,A-,Down in Washington Square,Dave Van Ronk,2013,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16972,"
Born in 1936, Van Ronk was the paterfamilias of the Macdougal Street folk scene from approximately 1958, shortly before its inception and well after his career began, until 2002, long after its demise and too damn early for his. He was an agitator and a port in a storm, a wag and a songbag, a virtuoso without portfolio who played Scott Joplin on guitar and banjo in a Dixieland band--almost everything but much of a singer. So while this three-CD set is the nearest we'll get to a comprehensive overview, it may be too gruffly hewn to convert you, and there's a sense in which I'm equally taken with the outtakes and rarities CD The Mayor of MacDougal Street, which Elijah Wald compiled while editing Van Ronk's text, leavings, and interviews into the terrific autobiography of the same name. Nevertheless, it established Van Ronk as a hero whose conception of American song was almost as all-embracing as Willie Nelson's. And one more thing. The label in parentheses up there? Smithsonian Folkways? That label is owned by a federal government a loud minority has delivered into the budget-slashing hands of yahoos bent on extirpating any trace of the demon leftism from Our Nation's Capital. It may not be long for this world, and it deserves both our support and our preemptive collectoritis. So check out, oh, ""Haul on the Bowline,"" ""House of the Rising Sun,"" and ""Garden State Stomp"" and discover a gravel-voiced post-Trotskyite who never stooped to protest music because he was just too damn smart.

Twenty-two enduring melodies--sprightly and contemplative, simple and complex--collected in the 16th and 17th centuries by people who could both play the lute and afford such extravagances. Some were composed by noble folk too proud to admit they dabbled in such low pursuits, but most came from minstrels and such so famed in their own era that transcribers didn't bother to record their names--or so believes the annotator, who puckishly signs himself or herself ""Anonymous."" Four centuries later, even the dance numbers are calming, their beauty sometimes merely pretty after all this time but no less welcome for that, and the most elaborate figurations seem modest, especially given the lute's anachronistically mellow sound. Plus there are those melodies. ""Lady Lie Near Me"" sets me to humming ""Cumberland Mine"" every time.

She's disciplined--10 of 11 songs between 3:07 and 4:09. She hones her God-given vocal intensity with no recourse to belting or melisma, and she keeps the grit under control, although the final minute of ""Damn Good Friends"" should have been crooned or even cooed. And with help from an actual-count 18 confederates, she sharpens herself some hooks--by my count, six of the 11 tracks connect instantly, with the heart songs lagging as usual. Just pray she sticks with her strengths and continues to confederate exactly as much as she needs.

Sloppy, silly, barely on the four much less the one, the 19-song studio output of Kurt Cobain's favorite obscure pub band is one of those punk miracles that makes you think anyone can do it just when you were convinced nobody ever would again. The pro in potentia is Eugene Kelly, now of Eugenius; the genius is his then-girlfriend Frances McKee. Toon topics include an acid trip, a dead cat, Catholicism, and coitus, which undergoes an array of ironically far-out genderfuck jokes that bespeak detailed experience of actual fucking.

Formally, this is generic live double: four prev unrec tunes, most of the ten remakes a minute or two looser. But Vaughan wasn't made for the studio--live is the only concept he has any feel for. His material blooms with a little weeding, his big throaty moan gathers head under a spotlight, and the dumbfounding legato eloquence of his guitar rolls mightily down his band's expert arena-boogie groove. As a bonus, he ends up by reminding his yahooing Texans about Africa: ""I may be white, but I ain't stupid""--vamp, vamp--""and neither are you.""

If the music was preachy or wimpy this would be a disaster, but not till I perused the lyric sheet did I even notice where his homilies got their start.

The model isn't Rod Stewart except insofar as ""Maggie May"" would fit on a U.K.-themed follow-up. It's the Willie Nelson of Stardust--songwriting adept as stealth interpreter. Where the Music Row grad reduced verse-chorus-verse chestnuts to chorus-chorus singalongs, the tropicalia intellectual deconstructs American composition. Jaques Morelenbaum is a salty Nelson Riddle, many arrangements highlight rhythm, and some are surprisingly stark. Tackled are two Porters, two Gershwins, two Berlins, two Rodgers, six other standards, and eight rock-era songs of dumbfounding variety. Dylan, Cobain, Byrne, and Wonder we're ready for. Maybe ""Love Me Tender."" But Paul Anka's ""Diana""? Morris Albert's ""Feelings""? Plus all 1:30 of DNA's disruptive ""Detached,"" with Arto Lindsay's flailings arranged for symphony orchestra? Flops include Wonder's oddly tuneless ""If It's Magic"" and the irreparable ""Feelings""--only it turns out Albert was from Brazil, and anyway, ""Feelings"" is followed hard on by an a cappella reading of Cole Porter's ""Love for Sale"" that indicts all romantic pop except Porter's ""So in Love.""

Playful, pretentious, political, speculative, and above all gorgeous, this collaboration is enough to make me stop carping about kitsch and wonder whether samba isn't the pop avant-garde after all. Gil gains a beguilingly arty patina as he grounds Veloso's precious lyricism, and if the translations reduce primal beauty to intelligence, that's what we get for never studying Portuguese. Not only do the airy tunes and shimmering beats promise an endless summer, they prove heat needn't addle the brain.

It's nice to have a decent-sounding live record of the legend, especially one that adds a few new songs--notably ""We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together""--and choruses to the canon. This is a more impressive testimonial to Lou Reed than any of his solo LPs. And if it's not as essential as any of the four studio albums, it does provide an overview of the band's music: deadpan, demotic, jaded, oddly sensationalistic, primitive both harmonically and rhythmically and all but devoid of flourishes, always hard-edged and usually quick, never slow and heavy at the same time.

One objective part of me knows that these barrel scrapings are for fanatics and archivists. But another objective part of me knows that the barrel scrapings of a seminal, protean, conceptually accomplished band are their own reward. From the raw power of the instrumental ""Guess I'm Falling in Love"" to the dry lyricism of the instrumental ""I'm Gonna Move Right In,"" from the tight studio ""We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together"" to the intense early ""Rock and Roll,"" you don't have to know jackshit about the band to enjoy the music--on the contrary, you have to put aside your preconceptions.

I was cynical too, especially once I'd ascertained that the audio on these three discs was as faint as I'd feared. Played loud, though, the sound improves--not quite crisp or bright, but there. Note that this trick doesn't work with Live at Max's Kansas City and ask yourself if you wouldn't maybe like to hear the number three band of the '60s, after the Beatles and James Brown and His Famous Flames, without wearing out its tiny catalogue. No new songs, true. But over the two hours that aren't devoted to three long, distinct versions of ""Sister Ray,"" no title is repeated, even though every one was recorded in a one-month span in San Francisco in 1969. That's pretty impressive. As is all the new guitar.

Four hour-plus CDs, 42 tracks, 20 discrete songs, zero new material, $29.95 list, and when ""Venus in Furs"" followed ""The Black Angel's Death Song"" mid-Set One I decided I could happily live out my allotted years without ever hearing either again. But I was wrong. Sonically these four discs comprise the classic Velvets' strongest live recordings. The performances are lively, varied, and engaged, and there's a perverse pleasure in hearing Lou Reed keep the poetry prosaic and crack wise about his bummers before tiny crowds in a San Francisco more post-utopian than it was ready to admit. Although the Velvets had been playing Marty Balin's club off and on for a month, they seem more assured the second night, Thanksgiving 1969. Set Three ends with a ""Sister Ray"" played as a 37-minute urban slow jam no less hypnotic than a Grateful Dead blues-and-bluegrass trip. Set Four ends with ""Sweet Jane.""

A pop boho and an ecstatic mensch, an exalted lead guitarist who loves to chunka-chunk that rhythm, Verlaine is a walking, cogitating rock and roll contradiction. Granted, the solo-with-backup hierarchy does constrict his wild gift a little. But Ritchie Fliegler's Richard Lloyd simulations get the job done, and anyway, this is Verlaine's best batch of songs since Marquee Moon--two years' worth, ten in all if you count the one that goes ""Hi-Fi."" Elsewhere, Verlaine evokes the touchy ironies of urban love--passion and detachment, adoration and despair--with deftness and soul.

Anglophobes and wimpbashers won't hear it, but Verlaine's light touch constitutes a renewal and an achievement. Synthesized ostinatos and affected vocals are deplorable in themselves only when they're ends in themselves. Here they're put to the service of tuneful whimsy that has brains and heart, a sense of beauty and a sense of humor. Goofy romanticism at its driest and most charming.

Supremely self-conscious, utterly unschooled, Verlaine writes like nobody else, sings like nobody else, plays like nobody else. His lyrics sound like his voice sounds like his guitar, laconic and extravagant at the same time. After three years off the boards, he's deemphasized keyboards in a quest for dynamite riffs, and he's found enough to thrill any fan. As usual, I'm not sure just what the songs mean.

Who cares whether it's ""real"" or not? However much Nina Gordon, Louise Post, and their bepenised rhythm section sound like the Breeders, you could tell the two apart in a blindfold test (probably). But the confluences overpower the divergences anyway, and good. Commercial calculation is as irrelevant here as they're-just-a-band gender-has-nothing-to-do-with-it crapola. Whatever their motives and existential reality, they're less coy, less goofy, clearer melodically, and surer of their rhythmic turf at least in part because the Breeders got over, thus diminishing (but not eliminating) their felt need for diversionary tactics in a continuing project of aesthetic reconceptualization--creating a pop-rock style that steers between male-identified canons of manipulative pseudocertainty and female-identified canons of pseudoconfessional sensitivity. At present, what they say with that style means less than how coherently and attractively they configure it. If and when they become (even) better artists, it won't.

They've never gotten respect for their girl- and sex-positive rock, and they never will. But they've never made a bad record either. With Nina Gordon off pursuing her dreams of Belinda Carlisle, the principles are down to Louise Post, who's as girl- and sex-positive as ever but more desperate about it. Whispery-vulnerable or bitchy-tuneful, she seems to be deciding that love etc. is more important than rock and roll, a truth always worth putting a hook on.

No deep thinker and probably a jerk, Gordon Gano is the good-looking cad in a collegiate picaresque, putting himself across on feckless charm and endless libido. Most will grant the Femmes' 1983 debut its cult status and leave it at that, but the 19 titles otherwise unaccounted for on this typically irresponsible compilation suggest that they stayed young through the '80s. They get away with countless variations on the hoary ""America is the home of the hypocrite""--""I Hate the TV,"" ""Old Mother Reagan,"" ""Lies,"" it goes on--and sell a lyric that begins and ends ""Dance, motherfucker, dance!"" They score with obscure erotic escapades like ""Gimme the Car"" and ""Out the Window."" And having rendered the titillating faux-folk gothic of ""Country Death Song"" and the rank jungle fever of ""Black Girls"" doubly offensive with bad-boy cuteness, they then somehow make them illustrate a shallow postfolkie primitivism they transcend by exploiting. Their demiacoustic sound the essence of inspired amateurism even when surrounded by horns, sitars, Jerry Harrison, Michael Beinhorn, they remain funny, sexy, sloppy, irreverent, unpredictable, and above all lively--still unconvinced they'll ever have to worry about their permanent record.

As an excellent soukous record, this is indeed a return to form for the most excellent of active soukous artists. ""Endena (Unfukutanu)"" is one of those grooves so eternal that it seems to (a) go on longer than its near-seven minutes and (b) approach eternal life rather than endless tedium in the process. And for sure the accordion beats any synthesizer not counting the one that generates it. But whether all of this would so excite the Afropop faithful if Wemba hadn't just compromised himself credibly for Peter Gabriel I honestly can't fucking tell.

In fact, this could be the first Bangles album, back when the femme quartet took no shit and wrote like it did them good, except that it's brasher in rhythm and guitar--not so Anglophile, so twee. ""The beat of love is a nasty one"" sums up their worldview, and if unlike Joan Jett they don't relish it, they also don't deny its sick appeal. Stay single and keep your heart off your sleeve is their solution, and I hope for our sake they buy it for another album or two.

Between their flat rhythms and their undemonstrative vocals, this long-running hobby band have to hit it just right to hit it at all, which on this retrospective happens most of the time: if not sweet tunes, then sharp lines or even driving grooves. So cannily generalized they make the polite romantic disconnections of academia stand in for those of all white middle-class America, their songs sound like what Ricky Nelson might have sung if he'd grown up to be a manager in the conglomerate that bought the Emporium rather than the wastrel who pursued a musical career.

Buck and Ringo notwithstanding, country music doesn't come naturally--not to city slickers, or city neoprimitivists either, especially Brits. So of course transplanted Chicagoan Jon Langford grasps it more palpably now than he did in 1985. And if this can't very well make us forget Fear and Whiskey, at least now we know the W. Bros.' debut was only a run-through. ""White Lightning"" and ""Big River"" will obviously impress anyone innocent of Jones and Cash. But Langford's remakes add a last-chance soul both songs put to use, and eventually, many of the originals surpass them. Leaving a radical postcountry record that begins in a ""suburb of Babylon"" and ends snorting the ground-up bones of ""the Jones and the Ca-ashizz.""

The more you listen to Jon Langford--or see him live, where he'll spout wisecracks for hours--the more impressive his verbal facility seems. But Deano is an equal partner in this particular metaphor system, which defines country music as the great lost conduit of white male working-class desperation. Langford tends toward the grimly matter-of-fact: ""That's why they're called bars, 'cos they keep me inside."" ""But I'll paint myself back out/Of this corner everytime."" Deano is more visionary, as in ""Pigsville,"" where you wake up next to your own chalk outline, or ""Hello to Everybody,"" where aliens abduct you to ""a warmer planet/Where there is no consequence."" Both sing so lustily that the band's indifference to the niceties of country as it exists in history is of no consequence. When the milder-voiced mandolinist Mr. Tracey Dear takes the mike, however, the illusion pales.

Loving Sally Timms as I do, I take no pleasure in noting that the Wacos have supplanted the Mekons as Jon Langford's main squeeze. On their fifth and best album, a questionable vision of country music that dates back to Fear and Whiskey goes around and comes around as Langford and company realize that they've hung around long enough to turn into the desperate working stiffs their faux honky-tonk imagines. ""I took this job in the summer/Never saw the winter rollin' on,"" Langford spits out as the autumn of his years hits November, and soon Dino Schlabowske is a traveling salesman doing cold calls on a circle tour he's afraid will never end. Me, I hope business picks up, which seems a nicer way of requesting more records this bitter and bracing than wondering whether alternate career opportunities are really any better.

Ten songs in half an hour with little to distinguish them formally or harmonically but plenty emotionally. Jonny Langford and Deano Schlabowske are so fervently acerbic that it doesn't matter much that the full lyrics of ""Lucky Fool"" and ""Going Down in History"" don't deliver on their titles the way ""Building Our Own Prison"" and ""DIYBYOB"" do. And the playing packs the kind of conviction you expect of college kids who've just figured out that straight rock and roll can take you out of yourself when you really truly feel the need--and really truly bang away at it. ""This is the first track of the last album,"" Deano begins, sounding like he wants never to stop. But half an hour later, he does. For the time being.

This isn't what they mean when they say protest music is boring, it's what they mean when they say protest music is subtle--only they don't, which is what's wrong with protest music. The content of the lyrics is as straightforward as Rastafarian thought can be (not very), but the spirit reveals itself slowly--""Fig Tree"" is Jamaican Blake, ""Oppressed Song"" Jamaican Brecht, and ""Fighting Against Convictions"" simply Jamaican English, the autodidactic patois of a ""common"" criminal. And the music--well. We've come a long way from reggae's ""primitive"" days, haven't we? The interweave of mixed-back horns and multiple percussion is as gratifying and elusive rhythmically as it is harmonically, Bunny's singing is endlessly sinuous, and if you think you never want to hear another version of ""This Train,"" you're just wrong.

You'd think these remade rude-boy hits would hook in quick, since for most of us they're not haunted by the ghosts of the originals. Only they don't--the Third Wailer's somewhat ethereal vocal presence, as well as the intractably relaxed groove that rockers studio flash is heir to, assure that. But after too many plays hook in they do, especially on side one, where ""Burial,"" ""I Stand Predominate,"" and ""Walk the Proud Land"" form a gently triumphant triptych.

In part because he understands so unmistakably that there'll be no new Marley, Bob's resolutely ital old bandmate is the one Jamaican artist who continues to exercise comparable vision, breadth, and authority. These versions of eight songs the leader sang first make clear that Marley was the more gifted vocalist, but they also make clear that Bunny's baritone added rough yearning to Bob's sweet sufferation.

Maybe someday soon he'll put it all together and become a successful poet, but this will do--the fact that ""Dilated to Meet You"" and ""Lullaby"" and for that matter ""The Swimming Song"" are funny doesn't mean they don't add to the great store of human wisdom. And as I recall, Chuck Berry made do with something similar for quite a while.

FALSE,A-,Unrequited,Loudon Wainwright III,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2136,"
Since most people can't absorb the head-on impact of Wainwright's conjugal details--how do you confront an accusation like ""You told me that I came too soon but it was you who came too late""?--the second side of this album, recorded live, tends to sound a little yockier than it should. On side one, however, the mockery has just the right edge of self-flagellation and is balanced off by a gentleness without which he might seem a little spoiled. In other words, the balance of pleasure and pain he's been seeking for five years.

FALSE,A-,Grown Man,Loudon Wainwright III,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2134,"
In a music where scions of the upper-middle class are supposed to camouflage their cultural impoverishment, one of the many irritating things about L-III is that he's never bothered. Another is his great subject, which boils down to divorce whether the metaphor is his kids or his mom or his waitress. Here, however, the metaphor surpasses itself on at least four songs--about a jerk doing the women's-lib hustle after the porch door has closed, a philandering father and his faithless son, who then becomes a father who meets his daughter on her first birthday, and an older daughter who gets the last word because her father scripts it for her. ""That Hospital,"" which is about life and death, is where his belated maturity comes from. Don't bet it lasts.
"
FALSE,A-,Here Come the Choppers!,Loudon Wainwright III,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12824,"
For a decade Wainwright has been keeping it real with songs about family trauma and songs about what a shit he is--themes sometimes addressed simultaneously, as in ""Year,"" where he first meets his latest daughter on her first birthday. Once his political songs fell flat because he wasn't scared or angry enough. Now when he's a shit you wonder why you should care--which is kind of hip-hop, don't you think?--but Bush has him so scared and angry he makes up for it, with a dedicated posse of El Lay studio vets getting in their licks. ""No Sure Way"" mourns the WTC, ""God's Country"" renounces Nashville, and ""Choppers"" imagines a bombed Los Angeles devastated as logically and surreally as a bombed Baghdad. And ""Choppers"" is no more disturbing than ""My Biggest Fan,"" which could inspire any singer-songwriter to do an emotional cost-benefit analysis on the touring life--and leave a 400-pound aficionado feeling flattered anyway.

FALSE,A-,Haven't Got the Blues (Yet),Loudon Wainwright III,2014,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=16295,"
Waggish Wainwright ordinaire, all but a few of the 14 tracks equipped with laugh lines that vary considerably in depth, acuity, and, come to that, humor. The parking song is a deft trifle, the dog-walking song a sharp cut; the NRA satire is heavy-handed, the Harlan County lament multidimensional; the one where his estranged lover dies of guilt is uglier than it knows, the one where they can't find the right date to split kinder than it pretends. My favorite is a birthday song for a kid I figure is young Lexie. It's tender, not funny at all.

FALSE,A-,I Could Rule the World if I Could Only Get the Parts,The Waitresses,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8590,"
The words still overcomplicate the music--the smartest person I know indeed. But even the title tune, written for Tin Huey, has pop momentum. Add the Xmas carol for singles (I say she was shopping at the Bleecker Street Gristedes') and the lucky TV theme (in which Chris Butler shows off his high school memories, or maybe his ethnographies), and the male-feminist Monkees reveal themselves as a cross between Blondie and the Bus Boys. And Tin Huey.

FALSE,A-,Swordfishtrombones,Tom Waits,1983,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3996,"
Though it never seemed likely that Waits had the intellect or self-discipline his talent deserved, after a full decade of half-cocked color he's put it together. He'll never sing pretty, but finally that's an unmitigated advantage. Taking a cue from his country cousin Captain Beefheart, he's making the music as singular as the stories, from the amplified Delta blues of ""Gin Soaked Boy"" to Victor Feldman's strange percussion devices (try the brake drum on ""16 Shells From a 30-6""). And at the same time he's finding the tawdry naturalistic details he craves in less overtly bizarre locales--Australia, suburbia, his own head.

FALSE,A-,Beautiful Maladies: The Island Years,Tom Waits,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4000,"
Whereas my favorite moments on Waits's many inconsistent albums--the pop parody-throwaway ""I'll Shoot the Moon,"" the rawly elegant ""All Stripped Down""--avoid the American grotesquerie he's overrated for, these 23 self-selections do not. As your designated bean counter I note that 10 of them come from Swordfishtrombones and Rain Dogs, which hold up as totalities. Yet even when I program around those 10, this also holds up as a totality, persuading me that the main reason Waits is overrated is that he's never given up on himself. Over more years than most reprobates have in them he's covered more ground than most boho-lowlife shtick has room for--in a cockeyed, wildly varied body of songs that find form in a music nobody dares call lounge-rock because Kurt Weill and Leadbelly will come back and feed them to the fishes if they do. This is a sound with no interest whatsoever in glamour, even as something to make fun of. When it meshes, who can niggle about the literary and vocal affectations of such a hell of a bandleader?

FALSE,A-,Mule Variations,Tom Waits,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4001,"
Between 1985 and 1993 Waits managed to seem prolific while generating exactly one album that wasn't tied to a film or theater piece. Between 1993 and 1998 he managed to remain mythic while generating occasional occasional songs and a rumor that he'd split with his wife. So it's a pleasure to report that his best record since Swordfishtrombones has Ms. Kathleen Brennan all over it, which he's proud to testify is why it's also his kindest record ever: ""She puts the heart into all the things. She's my true love."" Together they humanize the percussion-battered Bone Machine sound, reconstituting his '80s alienation effects into a Delta harshness with more give to it--enough to accommodate a tenderness that's never soft. Sure ""Eyeball Kid"" is a sick joke about a freak show; sure ""Big in Japan"" is a send-up about a failure. But by the blues-drenched reconciliation hymn ""Come On Up to the House,"" he knows how lucky he is: ""Come down off the cross/We can use the wood/Come on up to the house.""

FALSE,A-,Bad as Me,Tom Waits,2011,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15513,"
The three strongest tracks on Waits's most rocking album ever all feature not just Keith Richards but Tom's drummer son Casey--Richards alone doesn't rock as hard. Not to equate Casey Waits with Charlie Watts. But since ""Chicago"" invokes the Great Migration and ""Satisfied"" namechecks Mick Jagger himself, I believe the grooves on this album are thematic. Of course, the themes are thematic too. The carpet-bombing ""Hell Broke Luce"" and the one about bailing out millionaires while the rest of us murk around in the mud are low-life chronicles for a time when it would be stupid to ignore the historical connection between low-life and poverty per se.

No house-band barrocker, no funkified keep-up-with-the-times hopeful, never show up on a Tina Turner album. Like they say, he just plays the blues. Yet between sharp tempos and wordly-wise material, he overcomes the boredom factor built into that time-worn endeavor. Even when he lays back his beat has a forward tilt, and he's not proud about where he gets his songs--from producers or band members or fellow guildsmen. The sole throwaway is more than offset by the title tune, a bluesman's ""Change Is Gonna Come""--25 years later, for better and worse. It's not really a blues at all. The bluesman in question wrote it with no help from anybody except his father and his grandmother and the Lord above.

This band lives up to its name. The powerful, deceptively torpid groove evokes the pace of inner-city pleasures like ""All Day Music"" and ""Summer."" But however jokey and off-the-cuff they sound, they're usually singing about conflict, often racial conflict--the real subject of ""The Cisco Kid"" and ""Why Can't We Be Friends?,"" which many take for novelty songs.

Bass man Bill Brown's title boast dwarfed and outlasted the rest of their catalogue because Ahmet Ertegun knew how to channel Clyde McPhatter's weirdness, whereas all Billy Ward could do was sell it. On the Drifters' exhaustive Let the Boogie-Woogie Roll, McPhatter is too busy swinging to succumb to the histrionics that fly every which way here. ""Harbor Lights,"" ""The Bells,"" and, yes, ""When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano"" are memorable--absolutely. How often you'll want to refresh your memory is the question.

He played guitar on the Falcons' ""I Found a Love."" He started the band that became the Ohio Players. He hired on with Norman Whitfield. All of which could add up to not much when he's carrying a artist's load, except that he's a better-than-average writer, a hooky arranger, and a sneaky soloist you remember for the wobbly sound of his Magnatone amp alone--a sound that's seeped into his singing. Add the Neville Brothers' label of last resort and you have the black-trad trinity attempting the comeback of a lifetime--soul, blues, and New Orleans in one person. Also, he loves his wife and knows how to say so.

The Parisian-born daughter of an Algerian nightclub owner who fled with her family to Lebanon in 1956, she shed most of her Algerian accent before hitting the Egyptian studios in 1960 and is now tabbed by an informed source as ""one of the Arab world's great musical hacks."" But for most Americans, this CD ain't really about Warda. Rather, her richly generic pan-Arab emotionality provides a way into Cairo's pop mysteries. Hyped up by the beats modern taste demands, the string sections of what used to be called ughniyah sound a lot fresher than TSOP's or Goldie's. And the beats have more uses than the belly-dancing websites her lyrics show up on.

Although I don't keep tabs on postpunk's favorite free saxophonist, this is much the most confident of the three albums I know. With virtuosity and ease, he and a quartet balanced by pianist Matthew Shipp naturalize the sturm und drang of the post-Coltrane '60s. It's got a pulse, it's got a voice, it's got some heads. It's got unflagging energy. So what's to be scared of? A little noise?

It's a fine cosmic joke, the way radical sounds turn comforting as they grow old. I've played these three CDs for atmosphere during a Vermont retreat, for solace after a disturbing afternoon with my demented 90-year-old dad--for the organic integrity of live free, for chaos rendered beautiful. Tune in anywhere except the one bass solo per disc that William Parker gets for holding the world together and you'll hear saxophonist Ware or perhaps pianist Matthew Shipp or briefly one of the three drummers creating music that eschews the signposts, anchors, and trivial pleasures pop fans can't and shouldn't do without. Shipp is a lovely man and a wide-ranging artist, but in no other context is he so solid, and Ware's ideas flow nonstop. After all these years it's clear that he commands one of the great sounds in tenor sax history, very nearly on a par with Rollins, Coltrane, Webster--huge yet lyrical, and so loose. I prefer disc two for Hamid Drake, who drives harder than Susie Ibarra or Guillermo Brown. I recommend ""Aquarian Sound"" Parker and all, ""Part Two"" of Freedom Suite, and, definitely, ""The Way We Were.""

FALSE,A-,War Surplus,Becky Warren,2016,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17006,"
Warren is a singer-songwriter who put her music on hold in 2006, when her new husband came back from Iraq with PTSD. The marriage didn't survive, but they gave it a hard try, and years later Warren's solo debut, a muscular, bro-country sounding concept album where she sings five ""June"" songs and seven ""Scott"" songs, is born of that effort. June's a dive bar sweetheart whose love for her man is ironwood strong, Scott a casual patriot looking to escape the day-to-day who comes home with a mouth that explodes whenever he pulls the pin. Scott's memories of the girl who loved him best are painful. But they have nothing on the Iraq memories of ""Stay Calm, Get Low,"" borrowed from memoirist Colby Buzzell, who liked Warren's adaptation so much he wrote liner notes.

FALSE,A-,Undesirable,Becky Warren,2018,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=17404,"
On 2016's War Surplus, Warren wrote and then sang both the husband and the wife songs on an autobiographical concept album about a marriage wrecked by Iraq PTSD. Here the psychological calisthenics aren't so tricky. She does sing ""Carmen"" as a longtime loser who's found a Neil Diamond fan who'll inspire him to make ends meet so he can move her into the house painted blue she deserves, and the chin-up narrator of the undeplorable West Virginia opener could be a coal miner. But mostly Warren just works her own changes on the fed-up love-getting-by songs that are a well-earned staple for so many Nashville feminists. It's a theme and mood she seems to have become quite familiar with.

Not a lost genius, just a forgotten ""race"" star--the 6/26/41 session arranges the same tune the same way three titles running. But this is where anyone who's striven to comprehend the reputations of Sam's half-brother Big Bill Broonzy and associate Memphis Slim will hear the light--they played terrific backup. Scraping away on his homely percussion device, the once and future Robert Brown is almost always uptempo and always happy just to be like he is. So when the record business contracted during World War II, he integrated the Chicago Police Department, an easier target than Billboard. Bill and Slim, sly devils, took off for Europe.

Smooth has never been their forte--in fact, they've never given a shit about it. So this comes on as scattered as the literary art-funk you dimly remember. It's not, though--they relax a little, write real tunes, groove the overelaborate rhythmic attack, and add lyrical reach and purpose without softpedaling their ruefully cynical leftwing misanthropy. Which is their message to the world whether we (and they) like it or not. Since a little goes a long way, it's encouraging that two of the grotesque one-night stands have happy endings. As for the prodigal malcontent who tells his dad he wants to stay in jail and the good old goon who uses his pit bull as a credit card, they're just misanthropic fun.

With soulful Sweet Pea Atkinson fulfilling their authenticity quota and sarcastic David Was rapping like he thinks Stanard Ridgway is Kool Moe Dee, they diddybop nasty as they wanna diddybop along the edge of racial presumption, certain of their right to give ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" to papa's number-one son and to feel ""better than James Brown"" (whatever that means in 1990) even though they know they're gonna sideswipe his sexism two tracks later.

Born 1896 in a red-light district to a 12-year-old rape victim, Waters was the record industry's first crossover star by age 25. She made her mark distilling dirty blues through timbre and diction clear as a glass slipper--on the long-deleted Greatest Years, ""My Handy Man"" and ""Organ Grinder Blues"" are further eroticized by how supplely she restrains the hot mama inside her. But with only two tracks that predate 1930, this collection documents the Broadway fixture who'd win an Oscar nomination and back Billy Graham. Listen through her protective decorum, which takes effort after half a century of radio raunch, and you'll encounter not just a gifted vocalist but a born actress who delivers every lyric and walks off with several--most famously, ""Stormy Weather.""

FALSE,A-,Hard Again,Muddy Waters,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2476,"
Since the heyday of Chicago blues was midcentury, most of the classic blues LPs are collections of cuts; except maybe for B.B. King's Live at the Regal and Otis Spann's Walking the Blues (oh, there must be others, but let me go on) I can't recall a better blues album than this. The songs run the length of live performances--four of the nine over five minutes--without any loss of intensity, because their intensity depends not on the compression of the three-minute format but on the natural enthusiasm of an inspired collaboration. Waters sings as though his life depended on it, Johnny Winter proves with every note how right he was to want to do this, and James Cotton--well, James Cotton doesn't open his mouth except to make room for the harmonica, which sounds just great.

He hasn't quite been reduced to an industry, but the profusion of product since the three-CD Chess Box is transforming oeuvre into catalogue. The luxurious and intimate Folk Singer remaster, the seminal and historic Complete Plantation Recordings dig, even the rare and unexceptionable One More Mile vault-scrape are worthy addenda to said catalogue. But although this selection from his four post-Chess LPs with Johnny Winter may be on the wrong label, it's the one Mud to buy if you're buying more than one. Beat way big, slide and harp all over the place, it reasserts his virility as it establishes his droit du seigneur. In 1983, just after he turned 68, McKinley Morganfield died.

My theory is that by the time of this follow-up, he had a kid old enough to ask, ""Hey Dad, what's that little arm sticking out of your bellybutton--looks like there's a little man . . ."" There is, and he's ""not known for his liberal views,"" unlike Rick Cookin' Sherry, whose interjected P.S.A.'s warn of the dangers of shoveling snow and eating your vegetables--dangers that pale before those of ""Dinosaur Christmas"": ""Wrapped up in her stocking/There's a human for a pet.""

But with the neofolkloric Lokua Kanza also on hand, its 11-tunes-in-38-minutes constitute the most appealing crossover Wemba has yet devised for the voice his hopes come down to.

But here, at greater length than on any '80s album, he rings in his 50th year with superabundant pizzazz. The new touch--there's generally a new touch--is a xylophone. The old touches are the now sweet, now rich, now cutting leads, the varisized choruses, the assured shifts of tempo and mood, the synths emulating flutes and horns and innerspring mattresses.

Altogether as slow, sad-ass and self-involved as reported, this is a breakup album there's no reason to like except that it's brilliant. It has its own dark sound and its own engaging tunes, and although West couldn't hit the notes without Auto-Tune, his decision to robotize as well as pitch-correct his voice both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties. The second half the songs start to slip, but they come rushing back with the Lil Wayne ditty and the only track here about what's really bringing him down: not the loss of his girlfriend but the death of his mother, during cosmetic surgery that somewhere not too deep down he's sure traces all too directly to his alienated fame.

In this ever-changing world in which we live in, I can't swear my 18-track DL is the same as yours, and should there materialize a CD with a pretty cover and a credits booklet, I will buy one with my own money. But for all the chatter about this hypefest's mutability, I doubt any ""final"" will be different enough to merit a second review. I just don't have time to untangle West's ""creative process"" with so many lesser artists' creative products ready to go, and neither do you. C'mon--his genius isn't about his famous fame or his stalled fashion sideline. His genius is musical--production chops above all, plus the flow fools once mocked. And musically, The Life of Pablo is a backslid Christian's anti-Yeezus. Dark Twisted Fantasy's synesthetic layering subsumed 808s's electropop miniaturism enabled Watch the Throne's coronation boomeranged to the sacriligeous provocation my man Big Ghost summed up as ""I KNOW YALL LOVE TURKEY BUT YALL EVER TRIED MONGOOSE?"" The Life of Pablo is turkey--West's latest course correction, wittingly casual and easy on the ears. Unlike Yeezus, it won't top many 2016 lists--it's too blatantly imperfect, too flagrantly unfocused. But that's also its charm, and I prefer it. The opening parlay of ""I'm tryna keep my faith"" and ""Same problem my father had"" hints at contrition. Hedged hedges distance-or-don't the porn boasts he can't kick. His kids breach the narrative like that uppity Blue. His sweetest hook tops Bajan superstar with Jamaican sister. Kendrick gets his chance to bookend Chance and all but falls down. The pseudo-freestyle meta-wink ""I Love Kanye"" is a narcissist's ""We Don't Care"" and almost as funny. The sour-grapes self-examination morphs into a pseudo-outlet track. So right, there's a lot here. But right, it's no masterpiece. Get over it. It'll do you good.

Instead, what's best is that they fool around like male bonders should--""Feel the Love""'s vocal rat-a-tats, ""Fourth Dimension""'s Louis Prima sample, ""Kids See Ghosts""'s nursery rhyme in waiting, ""Freeee""'s long guttural E's.

The man's commonness is as monumental as his girth, and that's no insult--Barry White may not be Good Art, but neither is Mount Rushmore. It took real creative will to shape Reader's Digest virtues and that face and body into a sex symbol. On record, the symbol has weight because White manipulates studio technology with as much originality as--no insult once again--Mitch Miller: the strings-versus-rhythm dynamics, as well as his much-maligned baritone, resonate with physical authority. It's a little early for a best-of--he proceeds at a rate of two hits per album. But as someone who considers his raps entertaining one-shots and prefers his songs at top forty length, I'm delighted anyway. And though the token rap isn't his best, it does feature his greatest line: ""I don't want to see no panties.""
