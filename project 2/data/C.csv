FALSE,C,Arrival,Abba,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6280,"
Since this is already the best-selling group in the universe, I finally have an answer when people ask me to name the Next Big Thing. What I wonder is how we can head them off at the airport. Plan A: Offer Bjorn and Benny the leads in Beatlemania (how could they resist the honor?) and replace them with John Phillips and Denny Doherty. Plan B: Appoint Bjorn head of the U.N. and Benny his pilot (or vice versa) and replace them with John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Plan C: Overexpose them in singing commercials. Plan D: Institute democratic socialism in their native land, so that their money lust will meet with the scorn of their fellow citizens.

FALSE,C,Greatest Hits Vol. 2,Abba,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6281,"
Fourteen cuts, close to an hour of polyvinyl chloride, and only two of 'em made U.S. top ten. We have met the enemy and they are them.

FALSE,C,Forever Your Girl,Paula Abdul,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4282,"
If Debbie Gibson already has platinum imitators, there's more to the world than is dreamt of in Madonna's philosophy. This unthreateningly dusky disco-dolly-next-door plays the field romantic-metaphorwise, with a weakness for can't-help-myself. She's less imitator than imitation, short on tokens of self-creation--her only writing credit is also the only time she threatens to play around.

FALSE,C,For Those About to Rock We Salute You,AC/DC,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4287,"
Brian Johnson takes over, defining an anthemic grandiosity more suitable to their precious-metal status than Bon Scott's old-fashioned raunch. Also dumber. ""Let's Get It Up"" is a limited sentiment in any case. But I'd appreciate some indication that Johnson knows the difference between his dick and the light tower.

FALSE,C,29,Ryan Adams,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13210,"
Adams's fourth and final 2005 CD--Cold Roses was a double, remember?--comprises nine verbose tales and laments. None are fast, six are slow, six amble past five minutes, and all seem to go on forever. Occasional rhythm tracks notwithstanding, the music is dominated by Adams's desultory guitar, please-not-more piano, and sensitive vocals. Although September's Jacksonville City Nights was the mess a lesser talent would have barfed up years ago, puffs of tune and vapor trails of feeling did waft briefly from its twangy swamp. These meanderings are the kind of indulgence that ends label deals. If I were Luke Lewis, all that would stop me would be the outpourings of personal vituperation and musical self-pity certain to ensue.

FALSE,C,Songs About Me,Trace Adkins,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12903,"
Adkins is one of these guys who spends so much time in the weight room that his arms don't hang plumb from his shoulders. In the rear view thoughtfully provided his female fans in the booklet, only his ponytail and his cowboy hat distinguish him from the Incredible Hulk. You'd never confuse him with the similarly named Clay Aiken, a much wimpier guy, and not just in the delts--Adkins's baritone sounds like it emanates from the Mammoth Cave. But in the most essential matter you'd be dead wrong. Track record notwithstanding, the ex-gospel singer is every bit as much a calculated corporate creation as the duly elected idol. The 11 songs on this No. 1 country, No. 11 pop album were written by 23 songwriters, only one of whom has his name on even two. The most far-fetched is ""Arlington,"" in which Dave Turnbull vouchsafes the patriotic thoughts of a dead soldier--to be specific, the first Tennesseean to die in our current Iraq war--to former DUI Adkins. Needless to say, the artist suffers no anxieties over exactly why any of these songs he didn't write is ""about me."" These are ""songs I've been waiting to record for my entire career."" Especially ""Honky Tonk Badonkadonk.""

FALSE,C,Blue River,Eric Andersen,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6306,"
I was ready to discard this but because it was so pretty I suffered second thoughts, which is too bad for both of us. In 1967, Andersen sounded like early electric Dylan, so now he sounds like . . . James Taylor. He's honest enough to back himself with a girlie chorus, but that's as far as his honesty goes. If I'm liable to run into noodleheads like Andersen walking down some country road, I'll feel safer in Central Park.

Let the record show that they loved the people so much that with all deliberate greed they ""rearranged"" half of their biggest and only album for quick resale. Let the record show that to stretch the material to full-price length they basted on a fashion sermon and seven as-I-would-say ""versions."" And let the record show that the people understood their spiritual needs so poorly that the resulting live and MTV-approved product lingered a mere 12 weeks on the charts, never rising above 60. The revolution will be hard, brothers and sisters.

FALSE,C,Chapter II,Ashanti,2003,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12194,"
Thug moll no more, Ashanti posits the musical question, ""Why do gangsta boys go out with candy-pop girls?"" Beyond some Mary moves and her sample-ready ""awww baby,"" the sole outright attraction of her pathologically modest follow-up is ""Then Ya Gone,"" which turns out to be about lovers dying rather than lovers leaving--although at Murder Inc., leaving is all they do, right?
"
FALSE,C,Gimme Something Real,Ashford & Simpson,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6319,"
Can this marriage be saved? The problem: Good-but-not-great songwriters whose lush sentimentality would have been unforgivable had they worked for a white company instead of Motown leave Motown for white company. The doctor replies: if they develop the intestinal fortitude to go along with their own vocal limitations, they may not end up the Peaches &amp; Herb of middle-class soul. What did they say? ""Time is the space between you and me""? Well, sounds like a breakdown of communication as well.

FALSE,C,Champagne Jam,The Atlanta Rhythm Section,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6330,"
You can tell these guys are from Atlanta--it says so right in the name. So why do they sound like lazy Eagles? Why have they concocted a title that is the rock and roll equivalent of ""cocktail jazz""? And when are they going to change their name officially to ARS, as in AWB?
"
FALSE,C,The House on the Hill,Audience,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6331,"
You remember how in the old days when they wanted to convey how really far out ""rock"" was getting they'd say that a musician had ""studied at Juilliard""? Always turned out to mean he or she was too dippy to play real rock and roll, but we were young. Well, now we're older, so when it says Howard Werth plays ""electric classical guitar"" we know what it means. No matter how desperate things get. Right?
"
FALSE,C,Sense and Sensuality,Au Pairs,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=193,"
The renown of this sorry punk-funk gone pop-jazz is as depressing as anything in the annals of Anglophilia. Lesley Woods's line on free love is as priggish as the rest of her leftism and her separate-but-equal rhythm section couldn't make the earth move if one of them played tractor. Don't blame me for the metaphor, either--it's Lesley's, by way of famed protofeminist E. Hemingway, which proves that she's either open-minded or just plain dumb. Not since the Stranglers has a Brit group sexed it up so unconvincingly.
"
FALSE,C,Feel No Fret,Average White Band,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6335,"
Once their name was a candid joke about their limits, their values, and their aspirations. Now it's a flat statement of fact. Swinging California pop in the manner of the Doobie Brothers and Pablo Cruise, cool in its passions and its rhythms and uninspired in its composition, and who cares who got there first.
"
FALSE,C,Never Gone,Backstreet Boys,2005,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13090,"
Lest you doubted it, this is grotesque, and not just because stardom ruined Nick Carter like so many young people before him. It's more that nobody loves a man group. Blue-balled yearning becomes AJ-said-you-swallowed whining, which wasn't the formal challenge their Swedish Svengalis signed on for. Maybe they could learn their instruments and call themselves a man band, which rhymes. An album of Four Lads covers is also a thought.

"
FALSE,C,Two Suns,Bat for Lashes,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14544,"
The opening ""Glass"" does indeed deploy what a Pitchfork raver designates a ""strange mix of elements (chamber pop, prog metal, new age--what?) magically coalesced into some entirely new genre that I wish existed and yet still can't quite wrap my brain around."" If you suspect, correctly, that this so-called genre is unworthy of your brainlength, Natasha Khan will make you cringe. Compared to Kate Bush, Bj������������������rk, even Joanna Newsom, she's an etherhead, as ill-informed about astronomy as she is about love. That said, the beauteous Eurasian hippie does get a little grounded when she dons a blonde wig and""evil, evil,"" though to me she just seems confused. Grounded or ethereal, Khan has the kind of pretty, proper British accent that young men find fetching when linked to ill-informed mentions of goodbye beds and licking her clean. She has hitched her modest talent to an art-rock wagon she won't outpace anytime soon.

FALSE,C,Holland,The Beach Boys,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3475,"
I admit that this sounds real good--it's engineered clear and bright as a redwood mountain stream--but to overlook what's doing the sounding is formalism as deliberate stupidity. That is, the actual music and words are murky and dim. I suppose that in time their tongue-tied travelogue of Big Sur may seem no more escapist than ""Fun Fun Fun,"" but who'll ever believe it's equally simple, direct, or innocent?

On The Beach Boys Love You, lyrics like those of ""Solar System"" may have been a little embarrassing, but basically their silliness registered as charming. ""Match Point of Our Love"" (""Early in the game when you broke me/Just like a serve"") and ""Belles of Paris"" (""There's a chapel `Sacre Coeur' in quaint Montmarte [sic]/In the open air the painters show their art"") are just dumb, and despite a lot of fairly pleasant music and a few passable songs, so is this.

Eternally faithful to early Dan, I hoped to descry the lineaments of unspoiled genius in these 1968-1971 demos, but all I got was demos. Between Fagen's scratch vocals and three grooveless drummers who sound relieved to remember their parts, these are songs casting about for a form--that is, for Gary Katz, whose smooth swing suited them far better than the bare bones Kenny Vance resorts to. Worth salvaging: ""Don't Let Me In,"" in which they turn their collegiate cynicism on themselves for once.

Just in case you're beguiled by his Stevie Wonder imitation (I prefer Carl Carlton's, Chaka Khan's, even Buddy Miles's) on ""Masquerade"" (I prefer Helen Reddy's, Aretha Franklin's, even Leon Russell's), be hereby informed that Benson is not primarily a singer, but rather a jazz guitarist of the taste variety.

Didn't take them long to ripen from corny Nashville realness to smarmy harmonies and big finishes as coercive as Diane Warren's. Keynoting with a piece of grease designed to supplant ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" at weddings all across Middle America, their tribute to God confuses grease with grace for so long that by the time the antiracism campaign resurfaces it feels like they're just piling on the piety.

FALSE,C,Peace in Our Time,Big Country,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4393,"
Five years ago these fools parlayed a video, some guitar harmonics, and the oppression of Scotland into comparisons with future band-of-the-decade titleholders U2. A stiff, an EP, and a negotiation later, they're ready to settle for something simple in platinum on a rival label. Social consciousness or no (""Time for Leaving"" actually explains why a U.K. laborer is emigrating), they're just pros with pretensions this time around. Which suits the rival label just fine.

FALSE,C,The Hard Way,Clint Black,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=617,"
Country music is for those old or repressed enough to care deeply about monogamy--one-on-one love in all its passion, comfort, consternation, impossibility, and routine. That's why I doubt the Nashville hunks have siphoned much support from Nirvana, Madonna, or Public Enemy--their targets are Richard Marx and Bryan Adams. Still, this is a sad one. Spoiled by fame or his own manly profile--he looks so craggy up against his Knots Landing wifey on the cover of People--a guy who got Nashville to notice him with terse neoclassicist regrets gets Hollywood to bank him with soggy pseudoromantic homilies. Imagine how tritely condescending ""A Woman Has Her Way"" could be and you'll know what sentiments Clint considers suitable to a matinee idol.

By omitting pro forma virtuoso moves--""Rat Salad"" has vanished without a trace--this two-disc compillation makes a properly mock-nostalgic document. Only two cuts total (out of seventeen) from LPs five and six, but three from four, cleverly entitled Black Sabbath Vol. 4, which I never got around to putting on in 1972.

FALSE,C,The Hunter,Blondie,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=350,"
I've feuded for years with moralists who accused the band of abandoning a lowbrow purity they never claimed in the first place, but this is a lousy record by any standard--the pop, the eclectic, even the arty. That Debbie is writing all the lyrics is only symptomatic--the tragedy is that of an absorptive, synthetic talent trying to find its essence, a doomed project that's doubly disorienting because she's canny enough not to believe in ""self-expression"" per se. Instead she galumphs about in search of referents, referents she seemed to locate naturally back when she could walk the Bowery without a disguise.

As with Engelbert Humperdinck, their pop success does them more good in Vegas than on the radio, and only four of these eleven cuts made top twenty.

Only ""In Thee,"" a farewell to Patti Smith by Allen Lanier that deserves to become a standard on the order of ""Alison,"" is more than marginally interesting.

If the popular songs you love are gunslinging tales recited over a faux Bernie Worrell tootle, of course this wordy quintet will sound like some kind of change. Unison chants, schoolyard tunes, and goopy slow jams may not be how to rock anybody else's world, but gangstawise they add up to a new flava, kinda.

Never again can us wiseasses call it corporate rock without thinking twice. Whatever possessed Tom Scholz to spend seven years perfecting this apparently unoccupied articulation of an art-metal thought extinct years ago, it wasn't megaplatinum ambition. He's more like the Archbishop of Latter-Day Arena Rock, perfecting majestic guitar sounds and angelic vocals for hockey-rink cathedrals the world over--and also, since he's patently reluctant to venture from his studio retreat, elegiac melodies suitable to a radio ministry. If he seems more hobbyist than artist, more Trekkie than Blind Boy Grunt, that's no reason to get snobbish. And no reason to listen, either.
"
FALSE,C,Tonight,David Bowie,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4439,"
What makes Bowie a worthy entertainer is his pretensions, his masks, the way he simulates meaning. He has no special gift for convincing emotions or good tunes--when he works at being ""merely"" functional he's merely dull, or worse. With Nile Rodgers gone, the dance potential of the second album of his professional phase is negligible, and he's favoring the tired usages that have been the downfall of an entire generation of English twits. In this setting, not even Leiber-Stoller's long-neglected ""I Keep Forgetting"" makes much of an impression.

Only in a biz discombobulated by teenpop could an 18-year-old with an acoustic guitar be plausibly promoted as ""the anti-Britney."" Don't you remember? Writing Your Own Songs means zip, zilch, nada. By now, literally millions of human beings WTOS, and while Branch may be among the top 5000 (and may not), note that her hit, like most of the front-loaded material, was co-composed by her producer. In this she precisely resembles arrant bimbo Willa Ford, who made her mark batting her plump lips at Nick Carter and Carson Daly and may yet prove the more interesting artist. Britney sure is.

""Woman"" is unlistenably sanctimonious, ""What the World Needs Now Is Love"" is the raggedest singing I've ever heard from him, and ""Kiss in 77"" is ""head to head and toe to toe""--in other words as ""brand new"" as the ""New Sound!"" he promises.

Elsewhere she sticks to what she doesn't know--love. Debbie Gibson, all is forgiven.

FALSE,C,Belinda,Belinda Carlisle,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8218,"
At least Jane Wiedlin's solo was a well-meaning failure. This one's pure El Lay, vacuous would-be CHR with chief songwriter Charlotte Caffey spelled by numerous ringers. The best you can say about the best of these songs--namely, ""Band of Gold""--is that you've heard it before; the best you can say about the rest is that once in a while you think you have.

FALSE,C,Carp,Carp,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6547,"
For those of you who are really into Americana, here's an album with songs about Calamity Jane, a circuit preacher named Brown, and firehouse dogs. For those of you who are really into bands that have paid their dues, this one formed at the University of Oklahoma five years ago. And you won't catch Carp imitating Jefferson Airplane or Bessie Smith either.

FALSE,C,Born Late,Shaun Cassidy,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6554,"
Desperate to keep up with the younger generation (i.e., their kids), a few old Beatlemaniacs are murmuring that Shaun isn't so bad--he likes the music more than David ever did, his covers show some feeling, and ""Hey Deanie"" actually rocks. All of which is true. And all of which is still pretty lame.

FALSE,C,Henry's Dream,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5870,"
Cave's admirers crow about his literary virtues--a rock musician who's actually published a novel! and scripted a film! about John Henry Abbott, how highbrow! Then they proffer dismal examples like ""I am the captain of my pain,"" or the bordello containing--what an eye the man has--a whalebone corset! (Whalebone is very literary--it hasn't been used in underwear since well before Nick was born.) If this is your idea of great writing, you may be ripe for his cult. Otherwise, forget it--the voice alone definitely won't do the trick.

FALSE,C,Some Friendly,The Charlatans U.K.,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5854,"
Historically, children, the organ has occasioned vague-outs and one-shots. Unless you count the Animals, which I don't advise, or the Zombies, where Rod Argent favored piano, the only '60s pop legends to feature one were the Small Faces, and not as a ""trademark."" When you record your ""96 Tears,"" or even your ""Itchycoo Park,"" call. ""The Only One I Know"" ain't bad and ain't it.

The subject of a painstakingly hedged 2003 John Seabrook profile in The New Yorker, she's a teenage Whitney-Celine-Mariah wannabe who's more fun than Hilary Duff and less fun than Ashlee Simpson. Two and a half years and several million bucks in the marketing, her debut album failed to chart after its modest dance hit skyrocketed all the way to 99 on the Billboard Hot 100.  In principle, this is an ideal time for an American idol who is both French and--ooh la la--Jewish. But her flop feels like a victory nonetheless.

""Into the Groovey"" you should know. ""Burnin' Up"" you shouldn't, 'cause this one's ""the original demo on four-track cassette,"" and also 'cause it sucks. ""Addicted to Love"" was cut live to a canned backing track in a record-your-own-single booth and will make my top 10 if they deign to release it as a single. The rest is funny mixes, found girl talk, beats from a band not noted for same, and other remembrances of their avant-bullshit roots. Why don't they take this stuff to John Cage? I want to be sure I get course credit.

Don't believe the title, believe the artist listing. The difference is between a group, committed however fractiously to a coherent collective identity, and a bunch of stars fabricating a paper reconciliation. Maybe if Gary Usher had produced, as promised, this would be more than the country-rock supersession David Crosby has granted us--because maybe Usher would have persuaded the boys to let go of the songs they're saving for their solo albums.

Believe it or not, intol'able David has loosened up some since his big-band days, and his material is well-selected, but he still sounds as if he takes an emetic when he needs an enema, and unlike Tom Jones, whom he might emulate by losing some weight, he always compares embarrassingly to his sources.
"
FALSE,C,Shadow Man,Johnny Clegg & Savuka,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4549,"
No matter what the British Musicians' Union says, I don't doubt that he's progressive in the ANC sense. I just wish he wasn't progressive in the Peter Gabriel sense, or at least had Gabriel's talent and taste--his keybs and drums left one innocent byhearer wondering why I was checking out the new Yes. This is the kind of college man who thinks rock is art and ""human rainbow"" and ""ache that has no name"" are turns of phrase. Even when he sticks to the facts that are all the metaphor any South African poet needs, his vocal melodrama empties the words of poignancy. Progress deserves better. So does a multiracial society.
"
FALSE,C,Music Maker,Jimmy Cliff,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6590,"
It's time we reminded ourselves that there are only four Jimmy Cliff songs on The Harder They Come. His other great ones are on Wonderful World, Beautiful People. The nearest this surprisingly ornate and dinky album comes to a good one is the indictment of Island Records' Chris Blackwell as a ""No. 1 Rip-Off Man,"" very timely given what Island has just scrounged up for its own Jimmy Cliff album, Struggling Man. But both records portend a nonstar of the future--or a false one.

If Jim Price were a producer worthy of the artist, or even of the artist's memory, he would have asked Jerry Lee Lewis to play piano instead of Nicky Hopkins. Not that Jerry Lee could replace Chris Stainton, who combined with Cocker last time to write more good hooks than all of Hollywood's finest coughed up for this make-work project.
"
FALSE,C,Jamaica Say You Will,Joe Cocker,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6599,"
Think back to how drastically Cocker's early triumph--""With a Little Help From My Friends"" or ""Just Like a Woman"" or ""Darling Be Home Soon"" or ""Bird on the Wire""--departed from the originals; he literally forced us to rehear those songs. Then compare the strongest cut here, ""Lucinda,"" with Randy Newman's prototype; arrangement and vocal approach are almost identical. That's the nut. Cocker and Leon Russell funkified pop so persuasively that they set up their own minitradition, and now Cocker can't imagine transcending it.
"
FALSE,C,No Jacket Required,Phil Collins,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4573,"
Between his self-deprecating videos and his good taste in business associates (better Philip Bailey than, say, Steve Perry), Collins isn't as hateful as an art-rock leader-by-default turned best-selling-solo-artist-in-the-world-this-month might be. In fact, he's not hateful at all. But it takes more than that to make me want to hear a stupid love song again. Never mind the absolutely unsurprising lyrics and arrangements and just tell me why this is a great mean of Britpop voices? Is it because no one ever wonders what it sounds like unfiltered?
"
FALSE,C,Fat City,Shawn Colvin,1992,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5871,"
This ambitious sophomore wins the prize--the female postfolkie you're too bored to hate. The digitalized Suzanne Vega is wisely popwise and the bionic Joan Baez positively swangin' by comparison. Matching strong, undistinguished voice to literate, undistinguished verse, Colvin is like a young Joni Mitchell without swoops or self-invention. And lest you riposte that young Joni Mitchell beats old Joni Mitchell, Columbia doles out production chores to old Joni Mitchell's bass-playing husband, who drags the ordinary down toward an offensively well-groomed studio folk-rock that combines the smugness of '70s El Lay with the overstatement of '80s Megapop--and later for the '90s.

Cute title, but my best information is that you're still expected to pay for this in stores. And even if you weren't it would just clutter the house--from a great female hope she's developed into someone who sings ""Fever"" with all of the heat (and none of the charm) of Keith doin ""98.6.""

FALSE,C,Anytime . . . Anywhere,Rita Coolidge,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6622,"
This was gonna be her annual sultry cornpone, unobjectionable except for the Neil Sedaka tune and not without its soulful moments, when A&amp;M prexy Jerry Moss told Rita how to become worthy of Kris. You'll get more sales, Jerry opined, if people Recognize Your Material. Try a Motown revival, one of Boz's lesser songs, a Bee Gees number, maybe that wonderful Sam Cooke classic the Stones did once--and who can lose with ""Higher and Higher""? It seems to have worked, too, except that those of us with fond memories can still hear the originals. Rita is now halfway to becoming Andy Williams with cleavage. It takes a very special kind of stupidity to slow ""Higher and Higher"" into a down.

FALSE,C,Dig?,The Coolies,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4583,"
Lame as the assembled Simon &amp; Garfunkel songs were in the original, they're lamer still in these speedy, occasionally funny-voiced takeoffs. Though the band might have gotten away with an EP featuring ""Having My Baby,"" the only satire here with any teeth and the only one that doesn't target Paul Simon, I find it bewildering that anyone can hate Graceland enough to pay them for turning their stoned fantasy into an album. A glaring example of the post-modernist dictum that art about art is boring but junk about kitsch isn't.

FALSE,C,Easy Action,Alice Cooper,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6623,"
Pretties for You had its pseudo-decadent and -psychedelic charms, and so does this, only not as many, which makes very few indeed--""Mr. and Misdemeanor"" (featuring Lucky Luciano and Kenny Passarelli) and a junkie shoe salesman to balance off all the tuneless singing, tuneless playing, tuneless tunes, and pseudo-musique concrete.

They went out on the road long enough to pick up their share of chrome (well, this sure ain't platinum), but though it must pain them to realize it, they're not machines. Or maybe it just pains them to realize that machines break down.
"
FALSE,C,Country Joe and the Fish,Country Joe & the Fish,1967,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10987,"
There is only one first-rate song here--""Flying High,"" the far-out tale of a lucky hitchhiker--and while it is possible to become permanently accustomed to the slow instrumentals and songpoems that are this band's psychedelic signature, their rhythms and melodies are as unfocused as a bad light show. All this is salvaged, theoretically, by the politics, but the cocky, petulant, yet strangely attractive vocals never quite succeed in making callow belligerence seem an unmitigated virtue.
"
FALSE,C,Left for Dead,Crazy Horse,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5841,"
Anyone mind-damaged by Ragged Glory should note that the essential Crazy Horse is a rhythm section, as the kind-hearted designate Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. The chief vocalist-songwriter here is a fellow named Sonny Mone, who misses 1969. ""Once there was a rose in a fisted glove,"" he pines--and also real metal, dammit, not MTV shit.

FALSE,C,Human Clay,Creed,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5311,"
In the year rock died again, what should come storming back but metal--d/b/a ""hard"" or ""loud"" rock and, as Syracuse demonstrated, uglier than ever. Yet these God-fearing grunge babies sound falser than rape-inciting Limp Bizkit, abuse-tripping Static-X, party animals Buckcherry, or even world-dance Days of the New. Because their songs address universals, they don't debase women, a plus. But their spirituality is as sodden as their sonics. I mean, it's not as if familial oppression isn't real. It's the main thing that turns the hard and loud into truth-seekers and revenge-seekers both. So after years of Marilyn Manson lies, young bands seem to have found a psychic space where such themes open up the musical imagination. By contrast, these guys are still in denial, bellowing regressive circumlocutions to drown out the truth inside. Which is what? Maybe lust.

Right, you knew already. But though I pray I hear solo Y render the title song hopeful instead of smug, I know that in my head I'll still hear N harmonizing insipidly behind. And when S explains how when he was young old people were wrong and now that he's old young people are wrong and then disses ""overfed talking heads"" without ever once acknowledging overfed singing exhead C to his immediate left, I imagine some computer nerd with more brains than sense joining the arms race just to get even. Still a menace--and still conceited about it.

Problem's not that philistine tastemakers are quashing Neil Finn's hit-debut blues, but that Finn has neglected the only thing he has to offer the world: perky hooks. Programmers don't care what he's brooding about because nobody else does. Plenty of popsters have managed to stir up interest in their petty anxieties. Be thankful there isn't one more.

For once the title trip sounds like tragedy rather than just desserts. Not a musical tragedy, though suddenly the music bores both dispirited artiste and disaffected audience. As always, it's the artiste himself I care about--which is why I have no doubt he was a true star.

FALSE,C,My Own Way to Rock,Burton Cummings,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6665,"
This transparent egoist has had a way with a song ever since the Guess Who days, but the hard rock moves always seem to bring out the sexism in him--a sexism especially repellent because it serves as an outlet not for forbidden class animosities but rather for the familiar old arrogance/self-hate. So it's gratifying that his way with a song should desert him this time.

A good-looking lad with cinematic potential, but Peter Townshend chose him as the Who's front man partly because he doesn't have the personality or the smarts to assert himself as an interpreter. That goes even when another svengali--this one a collective comprising Dave Courtney, Adam Faith, and Leo Sayer--provides him with another frame. From anybody else, this would be one more dumb concept album (about the musician's lot, woe is me), and it still is.

As marketing, pure genius. Looks like alt-country, no electric guitars even, yet is actually America's answer to Silverchair. And hey, it's sincere--17-year-old heartland frontman Travis Meeks really is depressed, really has immersed in Soundgarden, really does think it's deep to hook your single to the all-purpose trope ""abuse."" This is why grown-ups need Hanson. It's also why they need Radish.

If the scruffy yokels of Jars of Clay are tent preachers, these hunky moderns are televangelists, their well-riffed Queen homage the musical equivalent of Tammy Faye Bakker's false eyelashes--considered sinful excess in an earlier era, but claimed for Christ now that it is known not to herald the end time. Reports that they have something--anything--to do with rap are apparently based on the presence of a certified Black Person in the group. Instead, they do up a jolly ska tune whose love object is, shall we say, not female, and address a generically whiny-sarcastic selling-out put-down to Collective Soul, trumping their assertion of spiritual superiority by insisting that they still ""love"" their backsliding brothers. They should remember I Corinthians 13:4: ""Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.""

Derided in such varied precincts as Pitchfork, Blender, and Entertainment Weekly when it stuck its head out of the quicksand last March, The Hazards of Love looked to be where Colin Meloy's obvious bad points permanently swallowed his subtle good points. But still the thing finished top 30 in The Village Voice's big critics' poll, so I can remain silent no longer. Except insofar as Colin Meloy's antiquarianism permits him to use such words as ""withers"" and ""blackguard"" (which he pronounces ""black-guard""--real pseudo-Elizabethans say ""blaggard,"" Colin), evokes online gaming and crypto-genteel '60s folk ensembles more than it does any kind of literature. He has the conceit to elevate melodies that are the musical equivalent of doggerel into mini-motives. His plot is so preposterous and unempathetic it's more the appearance of a plot, or an elaborate joke about a plot. And yet some fool in Britannia's highly respectable Observer thinks this album is ""as dazzling as it is beautiful."" Be vigilant. Be ever vigilant.

You know about the music, and if you don't think you'll like it you won't: impeccable pop metal of no discernible content, it will inspire active interest only in AOR programmers and the several million addicts of the genre. In short, it's product--but as product, significant, because it's product for the CD age. Stuck with over an hour of material after four years (after all, could twelve songs be any shorter?), they elected to put it all on one disc because as technocrats they instinctively conceive for formats that can accommodate an hour of music: cassettes, which now outsell vinyl discs, and CDs, which outdollar them. The cassette sound is a little too dim, as commercial cassette sound usually is, and though I sometimes find myself preferring the depth of the vinyl once I've turned my amp up to six or seven, the clarity of the CD gets more and more decisive as the needle approaches the outgroove. I mean, I have trouble perceiving these guys as human beings under ideal circumstances. Not docked a notch because at least they didn't pad it into a double.

Denver is everything an acoustic singer-songwriter might be--pretty, vapid, and commercial. ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" is a genuine pop archetype, and as an inhabitant of the temperate regions of earth I find that sunshine on my shoulder makes me happy, too. But usually his voice and his songs are tepid rather than temperate, as is the mid-'60s folk sensibility and stringless/hornless instrumentation. There's more originality and spirit in Tom Jones--maybe even Engelbert Humperdinck. If James is a wimp, John is a simp, and that's even worse.

This being 1970, DeShannon makes like the minor pop aristocrat she is with vague stabs at meaningfulness--in addition to a thickheaded ""Bird on the Wire"" and a cute peaceable-kingdom double-fold, there are lots of songs about her minor, aristocratic life. ""What Was Your Day Like"" is a sweet, factual, painfully ambiguous account of geographically unrequited love that would put me on the next plane--too late, probably. All I get from the rest is that she's been spending a lot of time in Europe.

Blondie's keyb man has always been a more adaptable songwriter than Bill Wyman or John Entwistle, but like Jerry Harrison he's a less engaging singer than either, which is going some, and in addition he lacks Harrison's flair as an arranger. Top track: quasi-instrumental starring Chris Stein.

Diop targets the New Age folkie escapists milked by his producer, TV-soundtrack titan Brian Keane, and the result has all the tensile strength of vanilla pudding. Admittedly, he's not the only African to utter a sentiment like ""We are all but flowers in the field/To nature's changing seasons we must yield/We only have but one season under the sun/We'd best take care before our time is done.""

But since then it's anted up some eco-yens and gone pop by advertising a track on this deeply anonymous Britsynthpop full-length. I kept playing said full-length, expecting a big pickup four titles in. Only it never came--the whole thing got catchier, but ""Days Go By"" just didn't stand out like it does on TV.

A ""family man"" when he's explaining why he fled the 'hood, on the very next track Dre drips contempt for the wife he's dogging and the other husbands' wives he's sodomizing--apparently because his real-life wife told him that would be commercial, rendering him a liar more ways than Eminem himself could comprehend. For an hour, with time out for some memorable Eminem tracks, Dre degrades women every way he can think of, all of which involve his dick (""the whole eight,"" as this master of poetic license puts it). Best friend S. Dogg, bad speller Kurupt, and Dat 'Ho Ms. Roq are among the hangers-on who'll take his (really Eminem's) money when (and if) he writes the check.

And at least Dr. Dre serves a commercial function--these ill jockeys are just a two-inch ruler for Marshall Mathers to measure his dick against. In the worst minstrel tradition of ignorant fantasies projected onto a dark-skinned Other, D-12's bum-fuck brutality and dumber-than-Durst humor provide a baseline Eminem can rise above in his sleep, as he promptly does. If you have to hear the backward rapping and ""Fight Music,"" put money back into the community--buy a bootleg.

With its barstool-macho equation of gunslinger and guitarschlonger, its on-the-road misogyny, its playing-card metaphors, and its paucity of decent songs, this soundtrack to an imaginary Sam Peckinpah movie is ""concept"" at its most mindless. I don't know, fellas, how do ya ""tell the dancer from the dance""? Have to get people off their asses first.

FALSE,C,Heaven Up Here,Echo and the Bunnymen,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4720,"
Word was these erstwhile-and-futurist popsters had transcended songform, so I gritted my teeth and tried to dig the texture, flow, etc. Took the enamel clean off. I hold no brief against tuneless caterwaul, but tuneless psychedelic caterwaul has always been another matter. Ditto for existential sophomores. And, need I add, Jim Morrison worship.

I too wish he'd come up with another stage name, and I deplore his reluctance to pronounce consonants. But there are worse wimp-rockers. I ask you, have Jeffrey Comanor or Pacheco &amp; Alexander ever gotten a song about dodging the draft on the radio? Well, I think that's what it's about. In a wimpy kind of way, if you know what I mean.

FALSE,C,"Emerson, Lake & Palmer","Emerson, Lake & Palmer",1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1166,"
This opens with ""The Barbarian,"" a keyboard showpiece (not to slight all the flailing and booming underneath) replete with the shifts of tempo, time, key, and dynamics beloved of these bozos. Does the title mean they see themselves as rock and roll Huns sacking nineteenth-century ""classical"" tradition? Or do they think they're like Verdi portraying Ethiopians in Aida? From such confusions flow music as clunky as these heavy-handed semi-improvisations and would-be tone poems. Not to mention word poems.

Ever the bullshitter, the St. Petersburg (Russia) muso cites as influences Me'Shell Ndeg������������������Ocello, Fela, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, and as an admirer of all three I only wish I could hear the way musos hear. To me it sounds like he got stuck between Music for Airports and Wrong Way Up and spun his hard drive for 74 minutes. He hears melodies whose vagueness he extols, I hear vaguenesses whose attenuation""sourness,"" I hear more tinkle.

Rather than getting all hot and heavy, Burbank's entry in the Ladies' Day Derby emulates the circa-1965 sound of groups like the Hollies and (says here) the Beatles. Execution is competent enough--axpersonship isn't an issue with the style. But the Hollies (forget the Beatles) always had pretty good material--better than these four women can provide, although making an AM novelty out of Cream's ""Badge"" is a cute idea. Also, as producer Richard Perry must know, the Hollies always had amazing arrangements.

I'm no necrologist, but the difference between Richard Farina, sharp-witted and spirited even when he was throwing himself away, and Tom Jans, often pretty and always insipid, is as telling an indictment of the acoustic singer-songwriters as I can offer.

As with most Anglodisco, this record's success isn't totally bewildering--it assembles an acceptable complement of catchy secondhand riffs and beats. Only I suspect that what sells it is the very thing that makes me hope I never hear those riffs and beats again--Cy Curnin's agonized can-this-be-adulthood? vocal style, influenced by everyone from Bryan Ferry to Lou Gramm but oh so much more doubt-ridden than any old fart.

On the evidence of these hits (the early albums were marginally livelier), she has nothing whatsoever to do with rock and roll or rhythm and blues and almost nothing to do with soul. The analogy isn't Donny Hathaway (who lives on in duet after duet), much less Stevie Wonder (also represented)--it's Barry Manilow. She made ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" and ""Killing Me Softly With His Song,"" he made ""Mandy"" and ""I Write the Songs,"" and who is to say which achievement will prove more durable? Flack has much better taste, I agree--that's the point. In the long run, pop lies are improved by vulgarity.

I'd long since slotted the banjo whiz's genre hop as one more piece of harmlessly irrelevant bluegrass virtuosity, but a simple check of his Warners best-of reveals that he kept getting worse. Between the workaday saxophonist, the omnipresent bassist, the drummer named Future Man, the leader pursuing chord changes to new frontiers of musical forethought, and guests from such exotic climes as Tuva and Eire, how could we expect any less than bluegrass speed for speed's sake, world music meditation for meditation's sake, Phishy keybs, and fusion stop-and-go?

This time, my rating stands for ""confusing."" This is apparently an attempt at a change-of-pace for Floyd's rather thin voice: some rockers, some slow stuff. Producer Steve Cropper uses all kinds of interesting tricks, none of which quite come off, at least not now--I'll keep listening. One song, ""Seagull,"" written by Floyd and Booker T., sounds to me like an easy-listening (!) sleeper. I suspect the Stax staff is capable of creating a whole new kind of ballad sound.

Which Joe Strummer, here reduced to strummer and backerupper, might actually spit out with some authority. Producer Mick Jones, dubbed ""My Boyfriend,"" acts as if too many chops are Peter Asher's problem, but it's just the opposite--in studio-rock, every note has to be perfect and then some, which leaves Paul, Topper, Mickey etc. two steps short much of the time.

This isn't as sodden as you might expect--these are pros who adapt to the times, and they speed the music up. I actually enjoy a few of these songs until I come into contact with the dumb woman-haters who are doing the singing. I mean, these guys think punks are cynical and anti-life?

Except maybe for a few pie-eyed corner-cutters over in marketing, nobody born before Never Mind the Bollocks thinks Linda Perry is ""alternative."" It was to avoid music that might distract from her big vague voice--referents: people she never heard of like Lydia Pense and people you wish she never heard of like Ann Wilson--that she axed her female guitarist for a male hotshot once her male producer took her aside. Janis is dead, unfortunately. Also unfortunately, her vision of meaningful rebellion lives on.

FALSE,C,Welcome to the Pleasure Dome,Frankie Goes to Hollywood,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4814,"
Hype is a word I try to use no more normatively than I do guitar--one's almost as intrinsic to rock and roll as the other. And this is a truly great hype. We're not just talking spectacularly entertaining, like the dripping labia of Mom's Apple Pie, or spectacularly profitable, like the Monkees, or both, like the ""Thriller"" video. We're talking hype as primary signifier, as a carrier of rich, profound, and potentially subversive meanings. I love the hype right down to the album package, and will even grant that the appalling quality of the band's music enriches the meaning further. But that doesn't mean I'm going to be caught dead telling anybody to listen to it. The singles side is okay--""Relax"" has proven itself a fetching fuck-mantra, ""Two Tribes"" is fair-to-middling political art. But on the whole Frankie are a marginally competent arena-rock band who don't know how to distinguish between effeminacy and pretension, like an English Grand Funk gone disco. Follow the ads by all means. Watch the videos. And steal these inner sleeves.

If there's a new way to go Hollywood, Glenn'll find it. His latest solo album had died a just and speedy death when the Beverly Hills Cop blitz reached ""The Heat Is On,"" a more Eagle-worthy song, than anything on this smarmy piece of sexist pseudosoul, and who ever thought Eagleworthy would someday be a compliment? Then Miami Vice keyed an episode to ""Smuggler's Blues,"" the album's only non-DMSR track--the anti-Soviet ""Better in the U.S.A."" doesn't count, because the main thing that's better seems to be making out. Bingo, certified gold.

""Now you remember that this is why you loved music in the first place, a love that was without irony, pretense, or posing,"" declare the postpostrockers as they pursue their lost youths--youths they spent writing the names of hair bands on homeroom desks. This is the essence of those bands, they claim, re-created ""with taste, competence, and as kick-assedly as can be."" No singers, songs, or blooze to speak of. No solos either. Compositions!

As a struggling front man he had a weakness for bathos; as a disappointed Nobel laureate he makes me miss Harry Chapin. On and on he blathers, a Bowie clone with glossomania, rolling out additional songs and verses for cassette and CD because they can't be squeezed onto twelve inches of vinyl. Though he knows far more about world suffering than you or I, he's almost incapable of writing about it. All he proves is that when you dwell on suffering you get pompous, something all too many rock-and-rollers have already noticed.

FALSE,C,Foxtrot,Genesis,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6903,"
This band's defenders--fans of manual dexterity, aggregate IQ, ""stagecraft,"" etc.--claim this as an improvement. And indeed, Tony Banks's organ crescendos are less totalistic, Steve Hackett's guitar is audible, and Peter Gabriel's lyrics take on medievalism, real-estate speculators, and the history of the world. This latter is the apparent subject of the 22:57-minute ""Supper's Ready,"" which also suggests that Gabriel has a sense of humor and knows something about rock and roll. Don't expect me to get more specific, though--I never even cared what ""Gates of Eden"" ""really meant.""

FALSE,C,A Man's Thoughts,Ginuwine,2009,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=14743,"
Even for low-talents and over-the-hills, it's not that hard to force out a halfway decent r&amp;b album--you just buy top-drawer beats like Jamie Foxx, or muster some semblance of attitude like Queen Latifah. So what's become of this minor innovator is kinda sad. It's not as if he overdoes the sexism or sounds like a total lame, although his voice does crack slightly on ""Even When I'm Mad."" But a man whose only quotable thought is ""I'd rather watch cable/Than see you with a negligee on"" has obviously gotten pretty dull himself. Even when he does spring for a beat from his onetime partner Timbaland, what he gets is strictly off the rack--unlike his pal Missy's cameo, which reminds you that 33 isn't old at all. But that's all he is. She's 38.

The hit--""Rock &amp; Roll, Part II""--is reputed to be reggae, but I don't understand why, unless reggae has been reduced to a catchall for anything with a simple beat. As for the album, it's easy to categorize--unreconstructed rock and roll revivalism of the most reactionary sort. Dumb.

For about a year I've been saying that people aren't stupid, that there has to be something new about this music, and of course there is--it Americanizes Led Zeppelin with a fervent ingenuousness that does justice to the broad gestures of mass art.

Sucked into the business when their girlfriends took them to see This Is Spinal Tap, they're the most physically unprepossessing glam boys in history except Kiss, and beneath the red satin and airbrushed navels are workaday attitudes, riffs, and yowls. The Ian Hunter-penned hit puts their artistic achievement in perspective--closest they come to a detail like ""And the heater don't work"" is ""Hiway lights/Freeway sights,"" closest they come to a metaphor like ""Before he got his hands/Across your state line"" is ""Let the small head rock her."" No smaller than the one on your shoulders, dude.

Closely akin to the early-'70s progressive rock that evolved into AOR, this sort of Romantic claptrap made Grebenshikov an underground hero in the U.S.S.R., which proves only that totalitarianism forces you to take risks for the most toothless banalities. Granted, some of the fast ones are vaguely visionary in a rockpoety kind of way, and the eclecticism is total--this is a guy who listened with bated breath to every silly piece of contraband he could get his ears on. Probably he writes better in Russian; possibly Dave Stewart's unironic production gloss creates the wrong impression. But his art-folk filigrees and art-rock ostinatos, not to mention the Aching Lyricism of his voice itself, are more deja vu than anybody with access to media should be asked to stomach.

I tried, I swear. Played it over and over so the music would sink in before I assessed a concept unlikely to prove profound. That way I could give it up to individual tracks whatever the state of Billie Joe Armstrong's geopolitical acumen. But all this did was convince me that I disliked the tunes I remembered even more than those I didn't--especially the slow ones that set up the fast ones within the same song, a hotcha-gotcha device with which the Broadway-bound ex-punk is deeply smitten. I don't like right-wing Christianists either. But as every oppressed teen in the right-wing orbit knows full well, they're not as garbled and simplistic as Armstrong's anthems insist.

The care Haggard put into his Jimmie Rodgers and Bob Wills tributes was palpable; this live-in-New Orleans-with-horns affair is slovenly. The two great moments are covers--""Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)"" and ""Lovesick Blues,"" both originated by the legendary (blackface?) yodeler Emmett Miller. The lousy moments include current hits, overstated polyphony, and (how did we stand the wait?) a third live version of ""Okie From Muskogee,"" this one a failed singalong.

Bloated by endless codas, superfluous instrumentation, hall upon hall of vocal mirrors, and the artist's unshakable confidence that his talent makes him significant, these ten songs average almost five minutes apiece.

What a weird (dishonest? ironic? clueless?) name for a record that's all literature and arty sound effects. Even the title song, while indeed describing the white South of the artist's putative roots, balances on the fulcrum of a four-syllable word: Meridian, which joins allelujah, sanctuary, Antonia, and great big Michelangelo in reminding us that Harris has put away childish things. Instead we get a record worthy of her (to mush up review gush) ""celestial"" and ""eminent"" voice, one that ""shimmers with poetic imagery and soul."" Mortality, redemption, angels, all the important stuff, adorned with Daniel-Lanois-once-removed soundscape. Nary an antiwar song, yet you know Joan Baez is proud.

As a slave of the very ""MAYA"" (pidgin Hindi for the concrete world) Harrison warns against, I am obliged to point out that playing headsie with the Universal Mind is not introspection and that the International Pop Music Community is not a group. Presumably, the featurelessness of these three discs--right down to the anonymity of the multitracked vocals--reflects Harrison's notion of Truth, and he's welcome to it. But he's never been good for more than two songs per album, and after ""My Sweet Lord"" I start to get stuck.

If you call this living. Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including a little man in my head who I never noticed before, have expressed intense gratitude when I turned the damned thing off during ""Be Here Now.""

I admit that his arrangements can be ""interesting""--my my my, a gypsy fiddle on ""Something""--but they'd be more so at a less stately pace than four songs per LP.

You'd never know Ann Wilson was riding the catchy intricacies of hired songwriting unless you listened more carefully than the resulting trifles deserve or her relentless overkill permits. And although the camp follower in me is sometimes tickled by the mismatch, it was the professional in me who noticed it.

Celine Dion comparisons are too huge to mean a damn thing, but only huge will do. Hill's singing is more ""human-scale""--like the female CEO of a Birmingham-based health-maintenance operation.

She's an SUV that seats five linebackers across, a radio signal that grinds the competition into static, the megabomb they'll drop on anybody who doesn't get liberated on their timetable. At this horrible moment in history, she's American overkill as popular music. One thing you can say for Dion--she's Canadian.

FALSE,C,Pursuit of Happiness,Rupert Holmes,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7025,"
As a much-covered pop singer-songwriter who narrated well-crafted musical soap operas, Holmes earned neither popular not critical status. So now he's pursued fame by moving to an avowed singles label, jettisoning the narrative and steering between Jimmy Webb literacy at his best (""Less Is More"") and Paul Williams pap at his worst (""Speechless"").
"
FALSE,C,Scenes from the Southside,Bruce Hornsby and the Range,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4978,"
This unassuming platinum mine is compassionate, serious, literate. He plays a ""real"" piano. And he's a menace. I mean, in the privacy of your own mind, try crossing vague Bruce with '80s Elton. Then run it through Firefall. Finally--this is important--slow down those tempos. No no no, leave the drum sound up. See?
"
FALSE,C,The Phosphorescent Rat,Hot Tuna,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15194,"
After four albums, or is it five, this spin-off also sounds tired and like themselves, more consistent than their sister, and why does anyone care when they don't seem to? At least when they were doing country blues the material justified the music's indolence.
"
FALSE,C,Cissy Houston,Cissy Houston,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7037,"
The sharpest pleasure afforded by the Sweet Inspiration was the juxtaposition of Cissy's rather vulgar pull-out-the-stops melodrama against genteel if kinetic arrangements and material. The voice is almost as interesting as it used to be, but the juxtaposition no longer works, perhaps because new producers Koppelman and Rubin don't know the difference between gentility and complacent meaninglessness.
"
FALSE,C,Whitney Houston,Whitney Houston,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4982,"
I'd never claim that this sweet, statuesque woman and her sweet, statuesque voice are victims of exploitation. She obviously believes in this schlock. But not counting the Jermaine Jackson duet from his own Arista debut, only one of the four producers puts any zip in--Narada Michael Walden, who goes one for one. And it could have been worse--they could have sicked Barry Manilow on her the way they did with cousin Dionne. Then the credits could have read: ""To Barry Manilow, It was a privilege to work with a talented professional who's made so many millions of dollars for Clive Davis. Together, we can make many millions more.""
"
FALSE,C,Nickelodeon,Hudson-Ford,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7038,"
""Complain about pollution, the downfall of man/And half-grown humans may be your fans/Add your shit to the pile while you still can/Cause it's hell on earth."" Hudson-Ford, ""Burn Baby Burn"" (Slick Cynic Music, ASCRAP, additional lyric by R. Christgau, Two Minute Songs, LAMF).
"
FALSE,C,Freedom for the Stallion,The Hues Corporation,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7039,"
There's no way ""Rock the Boat"" could prepare you for the studied lameness of this LP unless you believe, as I do, that ersatz gospel liveliness doesn't validate the hit of 1974 any more than ersatz gospel beautifulness validated the hit of 1969. (That's a quiz.) Exception: ""The Family,"" which studies hard. (Answer to quiz: ""Oh Happy Day."")
"
FALSE,C,Hysteria,Human League,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4986,"
It's clear enough that despite aural appearances Phil Oakey does have feelings, but so do BBC news readers, and nobody expects them to lead popular singing groups. If these Yoo Kay yuppies are really hysterical, they're also dangerously repressed. Polite hooks feh.
"
FALSE,C,The Tight Connection,I Am the World Trade Center,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11916,"
If they changed their name, that would mean the major labels had won. Also that seekers after the dark wouldn't buy bad laptop Blondie by mistake.
"
FALSE,C,Rebel Yell,Billy Idol,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4994,"
Videos have been the making of this born poser's career and the unmaking of his music. Not that they've changed how hard and hooky it is, much less turned off the unwitting many who find sexism sexy. But if you've got no taste for the sound of the sneer, the visuals definitely aren't fantasy enough.
"
FALSE,C,(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right,Luther Ingram,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11490,"
Great single--anyone who recalls ""My Honey and Me"" knows that Ingram runs into his share of good material--but in his Memphis way he's as colorless as Jack Jones.
"
FALSE,C,She's the Boss,Mick Jagger,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5043,"
History may absolve him. Jeff Beck earns his fucked-up legend here, and Bill Laswell puts together several bands--like Beck-Martinez-Hancock-Shakespeare-Dunbar-Ponce on ""Running Out of Luck""--that should only tour. So maybe a hundred years from now folks who've never read People will admire the timbral virtuosity and breath control of the man atop the tracks. But Jagger has become such an overbearing public presence that I for one find it impossible to care about his romantic vagaries no matter how hard he leather-lungs. It would be going too far, unfortunately, to say he's a joke. But the only thing left for him to do with his persona is burlesque it, which is why the title track is the only one that's any fun. And as my wife complains, he probably thinks it describes the way things are with him and Jerry.
"
FALSE,C,Glow,Rick James,1985,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5063,"
Rick has never been Mr. IQ, but this record is so stupid--not stoopid, just plain stupid--that his continuing failure to conquer MTV seems more disgraceful than ever. I mean, with his monotonous hooks, one-dimensional beat, fop coiffure, and relentless sexual self-aggrandizement, that's clearly where he belongs--he may be smarmier than Billy Idol, but what's a little grease among professionals?
"
FALSE,C,Passin' Thru,James Gang,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7100,"
Okay, boys, just as long as you're out of town by sundown. And Troiano, leave your guitar with me. That Walsh feller, he was a gentleman, but there's no tellin' what you'll be shootin' off next.
"
FALSE,C,Smile,The Jayhawks,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4849,"
The Jayhawks without Mark Olson don't resemble the Flying Burrito Brothers without Gram Parsons so much as Poco without Richie Furay. Not that they were ever as fluffy as Poco (or as chewy as the Burritos). But now they're as vapid as late Poco and then some. Although specifics do assert themselves, like when the drummer sings or the inspirational title cut references some northern clime, Gary Louris's boys aspire to the generalization level of transcendentalist parlor ballads, Hallmark cards, and, increasingly, Music Row. Alt- and any other kind of country behind them, they praise the Bob Ezrin who produced Alice Cooper and hire the one who produced Air Supply.
"
FALSE,C,Spitfire,Jefferson Starship,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7111,"
I still respect this group, I really do. Their apparently random yet inexorable evolution as a collective entity (not just Grace &amp; Paul Plus) resonates in their deepening textures. They seem to have ideals. You might even say they keep '60s notions of communality alive. Or are they just accommodating '70s notions of corporate identity? They're so vague--they meaning the people, the ideals, and on this album even the textures--that it's hard to tell. Or care.
"
FALSE,C,Earth,Jefferson Starship,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7113,"
This is slightly better than Spitfire (not to mention Baron von Tollbooth) and rather worse than Red Octopus (not to mention Crown of Creation). Its only ambitious lyric seems to equate skateboarding with sex with (male) hubris; its expertness conceals neither schlock nor shtick nor strain of ego. It is leading the nation in FM airplay.
"
FALSE,C,Ladies Love Outlaws,Waylon Jennings,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10957,"
Waylon lets you know he has balls by singing as though someone is twisting them.
"
FALSE,C,Piano Man,Billy Joel,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7123,"
Joel's Cold Spring Harbor was recorded in the vicinity of 38-rpm to fit all the material on--he's one of these eternal teenagers who doesn't know how to shut up. Stubborn little bastard, too--after his bid stiffed, he worked a Los Angeles cocktail lounge soaking up Experience. Here he poses as the Irving Berlin of narcissistic alienation, puffing up and condescending to the fantasies of fans who spend their lives by the stereo feeling sensitive. And just to remind them who's boss, he hits them with a ballad after the manner of Aaron Copland.
"
FALSE,C,Streetlife Serenade,Billy Joel,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7124,"
Boy, these piano boys--on ""Root Beer Rag"" and ""The Mexican Connection"" Joel abandons Irving Berlin for George Gershwin, or do I mean Roger Williams? Granted, ""The Entertainer"" is so nasty it's witty--so nasty it may be about Joel himself. But why does it include a Rick Wakeman imitation?
"
FALSE,C,Madman Across the Water,Elton John,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7130,"
The two decent songs here--I refer primarily to the melodies of ""Tiny Dancer"" (just how small is she, anyway?) and ""Levon""--clock in (with lots and lots of help from Paul Buckmaster) at 6:12 and 5:37 respectively. In other words, they meander. The others maunder as well. Ugh.
"
FALSE,C,Here and There,Elton John,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7137,"
I had a syllogism worked out on this one. Went something like a) all boogie concerts rock on out, b) Elton is best when he rocks on out, c) therefore Elton's concert LP will rank with his best. So if this sounds like slop (concert-slop and Elton-slop both), blame Socrates--or find the false premise.
"
FALSE,C,Blue Moves,Elton John,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7136,"
None of the few rockers on this impossibly weepy and excessive double-LP match anything on Rock of the Westies. Or, as my wife commented in all innocence of who was on: ""What is this tripe?""
"
FALSE,C,A Single Man,Elton John,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7139,"
Like the homophilophile I am, I'm rooting for Elton, but though this isn't as lugubrious as Blue Moves, it comes close, and the flat banalities of new lyricist Gary Osborne make Bernie Taupin's intricate ones sound like Cole Porter. Personal to Reg Dwight: Rock and roll those blues away.
"
FALSE,C,Uptown Shakedown,Syl Johnson,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7145,"
Some worthy soul veterans turn disco into commercial or even artistic regeneration. Others don't. For Johnson, who here abandons the rough, bluesy intensity of Total Explosion, disco means compromised semi-contemporaneity. ""Mystery Lady"" (she wears a mask) and ""Let's Dance for Love"" affect post-hustle hipness but don't achieve it, lyrically or musically, which may be why the Otis Redding medley and the Brenton Wood cover sound so half-assed.
"
FALSE,C,The Johnstons,The Johnstons,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11481,"
What do you call it when an honest and political Irish folk duo adds strings and horn arrangements for no perceivable purpose, including increased sales? How about sham-rock?
"
FALSE,C,Bulletproof Heart,Grace Jones,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5101,"
The title means nothing, because without giving up her stentorian tendencies, the dominatrix is here reborn as love bunny. ""Seduction Surrender,"" ""Amado Mio,"" ""Love on Top of Love,"" ""Someone to Love,"" ""Paper Plan"" with its ""marriage of the heart,"" even ""Kicked Around""--all proclaim her vulnerability and/or softness of orifice. The effect is so incongruous that when she quotes Nancy Reagan on crack (never say she has no social conscience), there's only one answer. No, Grace--no!
"
FALSE,C,Heart Land,The Judds,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5114,"
This which-one-had-the-baby mother-and-daughter act was cute for about fifteen minutes. They've long since revealed themselves as neotraditionalism's most shameless nostalgia pimps, and the only way their sexual politics could get more disgusting is if their songwriters slipped them wife-swapping jokes. To honor this achievement, their label herewith institutes a nine-track limit for country LPs. I remember when twelve down to eleven was a scandal, and submit that in this case like so many others zero might be a more socially responsible target.
"
FALSE,C,Sunfighter,Paul Kantner/Grace Slick,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7166,"
More sci-fi rev and Tamalpaian grandeur from Frisco's royal family. I dig the cover and the two Grace Slick songs, though not the way she keens them, but the rest of this is Paulie II picking his nose.
"
FALSE,C,House of Pain,Sarah Kernochan,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11436,"
The lyrics looked so great--like good words, not bad poetry--that I put the record on instantly, only to recoil seconds later. Admittedly, I got used to this mannered (ill-mannered?) music eventually; but I recommend a year of live audiences before her next studio date.
"
FALSE,C,Friends,B.B. King,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7181,"
If Dave Crawford really wants to turn B.B. into a major ""contemporary"" soul singer, he shouldn't make him sing Dave Crawford's songs. Best cut: the instrumental.
"
FALSE,C,Rhymes and Reasons,Carole King,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7189,"
The melodies retain their overall charm, but because the lyrics continue their retreat, the hooks, such as they are, never jolt the expectations.
"
FALSE,C,Wrap Around Joy,Carole King,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7191,"
The good news is that Carole's new lyricist used to work with Steely Dan. The bad news is that in Steely Dan he was a vocalist.
"
FALSE,C,Islands,King Crimson,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7200,"
Just as I was learning to hear past the bullshit they upped the ante, so fuck 'em. When I feel the need for contemporary chamber music or sexist japes, jazz libre or vers ordinaire, I'll go to the source(s).
"
FALSE,C,Standing in the Spotlight,Dee Dee King,1989,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5139,"
He does have his own style--not even Deborah Harry would dare rap over such one-dimensional beats--and I like ""Too Much To Drink,"" the latest in the surprising spate of rock temperance anthems. But Dee Dee, we German-Americans believe in grammar. You're not ""the baddest rapper in Whitestone, Queens""--you're ""the worst rapper in Whitestone, Queens.""
"
FALSE,C,After All This Time,Bonnie Koloc,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7230,"
On the first side she wishes to combine Grace Slick's priestess with Joan Baez's bowdlerizing aesthete, and the strain is gruesome, especially on the high notes. On the second side she shows the makings of a likable folkie, especially on a blues she wrote herself. But the high notes are still a strain.
"
FALSE,C,Follow the Leader,Korn,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1960,"
Korn deny they're metal; that's Judas Priest, all four-four pomp and guitar solos. But they nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal--an expressive mode it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary whiteboys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat--is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display. Now calling up death-metal's signature groan to prove only to prove he's authentic, poor not-actually-abused Jonathan Davis raps, recites, scats, and sings dull tunes landscaped with eerie licks, odd bridges, and a hyperactive rhythm section. How much his fans identify with ""My Gift to You"" (""I kiss your lifeless skin""), ""Cameltosis"" (""You trick-ass slut""), or the tragic ""Seed"" (""Do I need this fame?"") remains unclear. But I'm parent enough to hope they can find a more fully formed designated someone than a guy whose idea of transgressive art is netcasting soft-core s&amp;m to any teenager with a logon.
"
FALSE,C,5,Lenny Kravitz,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2033,"
His racially convoluted formalism having long since come clean as a total absence of original ideas, he grabs the brass ring from the back of a tacked-on Guess Who cover best heard on the far more imaginative Austin Powers soundtrack. Lenny, your work here on earth is done. We've got Derek Jeter now.
"
FALSE,C,Kristofferson,Kris Kristofferson,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7240,"
""Me and Bobby McGee"" is only the beginning--this former Rhodes scholar is as deft and common as any songwriter in Nashville, though he's better off keeping it personal with a heartbreak song like ""For the Good Times"" than justifying his scruffy appearance with penny-ante satire like ""Blame It on the Stones."" But he's the worst singer I've ever heard. It's not that he's off key--he has no relation to key. He also has no phrasing, no dynamics, no energy, no authority, no dramatic ability, and no control of the top two-thirds of his six-note range. Recommended to demo collectors.
"
FALSE,C,Songs of Kristofferson,Kris Kristofferson,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7242,"
Over the years, Kristofferson has learned enough about acting to challenge George Burns as a crooner, although the veteran is stronger in the rebop department. It's conceivable he might even do somewhat better now on some of his great early songs. But not on this glorified repackage.
"
FALSE,C,K,Kula Shaker,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5934,"
What Happy Mondays did for substance abuse these fools vow to accomplish for spirit abuse. Drunk on Krishna, they take an anonymously commonplace chorus-guitar melange and stir in some sitar/tabla/tamboura and banalities I hope aren't translated from the Hindi. Bet it wouldn't occur to Cornershop to inform Billboard that Indians are ""content"" because they have ""faith."" Kaleidoscope either.
"
FALSE,C,Labelle,Labelle,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7246,"
I find this group's mystique mysterious. Unlike most girl groups they boast a lady-soul front woman, but so do the Sweet Inspirations. They can trade leads like the Temptations, but rarely bother. They have their own songwriter, but she hasn't written any good songs. And though I too prefer their style of upward mobility to the Supremes', it's mostly aura--a matter of costuming and melodrama. I like what they do with ""Wild Horses""--maybe the way to save that overstated metaphor is to overstate it some more. But too often they change the beauty of the melody until it sounds just like an op-e-ra.
"
FALSE,C,Moon Shadow,Labelle,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7247,"
Nine songs--six by Nona Hendryx, one by Sarah Dash, and one each by Peter Townshend and Cat Stevens. The latter two lead off each side. And are easily the pick of the record. Cat Stevens.
"
FALSE,C,Phoenix,Labelle,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11601,"
Maybe if Patti came a little more like the falling rain and a little less like a water main these songs about quasars and amazing birds wouldn't sound so gushy. Exception: ""Far As We Felt Like Goin'"" which Nona Hendryx didn't write.
"
FALSE,C,5 Live,Robin Lane & the Chartbusters,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5343,"
A new wave demands new gimmicks, and bizzers have been working overtime to create them.  For the big guys they long ago came up with the redundant live double. So for the little guys they've devised the redundant live half.
"
FALSE,C,Twelve Deadly Cyns,Cyndi Lauper,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8707,"
The statistics are brutal. The six best tracks on this 10-year retrospective, arrayed all in a row after a bombastic new Mann-Weil cover, are all from her decade-old debut, and if ""When You Were Mine"" had been thrown in the figure would have been seven. So you decide--wanna buy this for ""True Colors"" and ""I Think About You""? I thought not, and that was without mentioning the ""Girls"" remix or the Mary Chapin Carpenter song about pigeons. Maybe she was so set on fun because she guessed it would be hell from there on in.
"
FALSE,C,Some Time in New York City,John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7267,"
Half caterwauling live weirdness with the Mothers of Invention, half tuneless topical rock songs with Elephant's Memory, this is where Lennon risks his charisma instead of investing it. I like its rawness and its basic good-heartedness, though J&amp;Y's politics are frequently condescending. But if agitprop is one thing and wrong-headed agitprop another, agitprop that doesn't reach its intended audience is hardly a thing at all.
"
FALSE,C,Valotte,Julian Lennon,1984,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5366,"
I'd hoped to let this one die in dignified silence--figured you couldn't blame the boy for trying. But as it's now sold over 500,000 RIAA-certified copies, discretion is useless. Anyway, I do blame him for trying. Aside from the eerie vocal resemblance, this is bland professional pop of little distinction and less necessity--tuneful at times, tastefully produced of course, and with no discernible reason for being, more Frank Sinatra Jr. than (even) Hank Williams Jr. Julian seems well brought up, a credit to his long-suffering mom. I suggest he invest his royalties in medical school--or else, if he's so keen on not wasting his genetic heritage, launch a career in the visual arts.
"
FALSE,C,Kings of Crunk,Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz,2002,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12237,"
Buried on this cruddy album is a great gimmick half perfected on the climactic ""Get Low"": oi anthems gone south, crude and compelling unison chants about flexing muscle in a club where another clique does something you don't like, such as breathe. Socially retrograde, but so was tango, and Lil's namesake Elton beat him to the theme by three decades. What's truly retrograde is the rapping--when Too Short takes a turn you'd think Rakim had dropped in from paradise--and the pimp shit eaten by boy-toy-for-hire Oobie and bull mackstress Chyna Whyte. As if in illustration, this version of ""Get Low"" includes an indistinct verse about stupid bitches poppin' pussy on a pole. It's omitted from both remixes on the new Part II. They knew what to do. Now you do too.
"
FALSE,C,Mouth to Mouth,"Lipps, Inc.",1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5380,"
How can bizzers moan about the downfall of disco with this Silver Convention homage bigger than the Royal Guardsmen? Auteur named Steven Greenberg, medium named Cynthia Johnson, funky town named Minneapolis, thirty long minutes, one great hook. An accountant's dream.
"
FALSE,C,A Place in the Sun,Lit,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5313,"
Led by two Orange County lads whose dad was a pop DJ, they like Vegas and old Cadillacs, make too much of their play on ""come,"" ""complete,"" and ""completely miserable,"" and serve as a dull-dull-dull reminder to anyone besotted with Blink 182 that punk in itself guaranteed nothing even in the days of the Real Kids and the Suicide Commandos.
"
FALSE,C,Freedom No Compromise,Little Steven,1987,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5386,"
There are good singers who moan and good singers who whine, but this doomed soul is neither. He's just a guy who longs to let all the love and pain and ambition inside him out, and who isn't even any good at imitating those who know how. Civic virtue, rhythmic responsibility, sartorial overkill--none of them will gain him an ounce more popular credibility than he's already gained on the coattails of this icon or that issue. As usual, it's only as a writer of protest songs that he shows any knack--Rub����������""Bitter Fruit"" the way Black Uhuru did ""Solidarity,"" and without Steven's phony accent. One hell of an expensive demo.
"
FALSE,C,Roll On,The Living End,2001,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6206,"
So whatever happened to that Clash-sounding '80s band from Switzerland, I forget their name? Right now I wish I knew. Presumably they didn't turn into an Alarm-acting '00s band from Australia, because these Melbourne laddies are Young, you bet, and also Indigenous in their Anglo-Saxon way, imbued with ""the Rose Tattoo and AC/DC [in their rock dreams--ed.] and the Angels."" Notice they don't mention INXS or Midnight Oil, relevant in their unfettered ambition and feckless idealism, respectively. Nor is the latter anything to write Stone about. Of the approximately four political songs, only the immigration-keyed ""Don't Shut the Gate"" is effective even artistically, and the antiunion tack of the opener, however well justified by specifics, is a bad sign. It's no fun to point out that dumb bands give agitprop a bad name. But they do.
"
FALSE,C,I Came to Dance,Nils Lofgren,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7295,"
In which the aging prodigy flirts with hackdom and almost scores. He still makes killer licks sound easy, although the melodies are drying up fast, and despite an ominous piece of Inspirational Verse--""I'll play guitar all night and day, just don't ask me to think""--and a road song that sounds like the first of a series, there's more ambitious lyric-writing here than on either of the two previous A&amp;M LPs. Thing is, except for ""Happy Ending Kids"" and a sly ditty about eating pussy, the lyrics don't work; whether ""Jealous Gun"" is straight anti-hunting propaganda or an allegory about who knows what, its language is stillborn and its pretensions annoying.

FALSE,C,Sittin' In,Loggins and Messina,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2101,"
This session is where engineer-producer Messina was supposed to escape group life, but no such luck. Despite the transcendent melody of ""Danny's Song,"" Loggins makes like Richie Furay only squarer, and this sounds like more it's ""serious.""

Add the soul of the Damned to the heart of the Dead Boys and you get new-wave Black Sabbath, complete with technoprofessional arena echo guaranteed to attract music-lovers who will either take the band's superstitious yet not altogether worthless political doomsaying as gospel or else ignore it altogether.

FALSE,C,At My Age,Nick Lowe,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13800,"
That would be 58, since he brought it up. Geezer's seven months to the good side of Robert Plant, who you'd never know was showing more savoir faire from the way bloggerati who weren't alive when ""Marie Prevost"" was written fawn over this labour of louche. Reborn as a crooner because he can't rev up the rock anymore, he can't rev up the croon either. Wit: Shot. Insouciance: Shot. Romantic prospects: On this evidence, shot. If you're worried about aging gracefully, maybe it's back to Elvis C. after all.

Not only did the single break the new wave/disco barrier, it packed an instant wallop worthy of its title--you could hear it explode up the charts from moment of impact. All that's audible here is Robin Scott straining to duplicate his own lighthearted, worldly-wise eclecticism and exposing himself as a hopeless dilettante in the process.

FALSE,C,Secondhand Daylight,Magazine,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7315,"
If it weren't for the two great singles--""Shot by Both Sides"" (available on Real Life, now also released domestically) and ""I Love You You Big Dummy"" (a B-side Beefheart cover)--I'd be certain this was the most overrated band in new-wave Britain. And given the grandiose arrangements, ululating vocals, and published-poet lyrics, I'm pretty sure anyway. Back in the good old days we had a word for this kind of thing--pretentious.

FALSE,C,Apocalypse,Mahavishnu Orchestra,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7328,"
McLaughlin was right to decide to revamp. But hiring a vocalist, a string section, Michael Tilson-Thomas, and the London Symphony Orchestra isn't revamping. It's spiritual pride pure and simple--or else impure and complicated.

FALSE,C,Greatest Hits,The Main Ingredient,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7331,"
The Moments with class and/or a sense of moderation, which goes to show what's important in life. ""Everybody Plays the Fool"" is catchy black pop. Everything else they play isn't.

FALSE,C,Eyes on Tomorrow,Miriam Makeba,1991,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5861,"
It was made in Johannesburg, and that's a triumph. But unless you live there yourself, which means taking your uplift wherever you find it, save this genteel schlock for your Afrocentric grandma, who may not appreciate the gesture--she knows how much vague promises are worth. Even if you ignore the corny crossover lyrics, the all-purpose synthesizers, and the received licks from many lands, Dorothy Masuka is singing better, and without dated stabs at modernization. Dizzy Gillespie don't sound so hot either.
"
FALSE,C,Manilow II,Barry Manilow,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11690,"
Manilow arouses all the distrust that a man who achieved affluence making advertising music deserves: even if he is as sentimental sometimes, as his hit would indicate, he has no right to be. Nevertheless, a couple of songs written with someone named Enoch Anderson, who must deserve better, stick with me. The jingle strikes again?
"
FALSE,C,Singin' With the Big Bands,Barry Manilow,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8710,"
Tempting though it would be to tweak reformed Halo of Flies fans for going gaga over Tony Bennett, the wily codger's as prudent as ever about deploying his lovingly preserved pipes. Trevor Horn's Tom Jones joke travesties an artist who's always clocked dollars making fun of himself. But this guy's got a nerve. It's less ghoulish than some ""Unforgettable""-style computer nightmare in which Barry magically replaces Martha Tilton or Tex Beneke on classic swing records, but it's also worse--swing as '50s television music, stupefying chestnuts (three each from Sinatra and the Andrews Sisters, what taste), backed by recreated or reconceived live big band arrangements (sometimes from the original bands, whatever that can mean after 50 years, more often from ""the Big Band Orchestra""). Fronted, of course, by Manilow's uncompromisingly inoffensive voice--a voice that never hints at sex or history or even chops. Incomprehensible Press Quote: ""'I've found a funkiness and intelligence in the music that will last forever. Hopefully, everyone can feel the honesty and grit on the album that will remind us of what a hip era this was.'""

FALSE,C,The Roaring Silence,Manfred Mann's Earth Band,1976,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7350,"
Side two is so slavish in its heavy-metal pretensions that it sounds like a parody that doesn't come off. Which is why I'm inclined to give up on this band and describe side one as two worthy songs stretched out of shape on a synthesizer. If this is what the audience Mann has found on tour wants, he should retreat to the studio.

FALSE,C,Chances Are,Bob Marley,1981,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5411,"
Compiled from what executive producer Danny Sims claims are unreleased 1968-1972 tracks and Sims's adversaries claim are overdubbed 1968-1972 demos, this is grave-robbing either way. Neither songs nor singing are what you'd call exquisite, and while the production shares certain of its awkwardnesses with the Marley-penned reggae that Sims' old partner Johnny Nash laid down after ""I Can See Clearly Now,"" it's busier and rougher--busier and rougher than pre-Catch a Fire Wailers, too. Musically, there's often not much difference between unreleased tracks and overdubbed demos.

FALSE,C,Ricky Martin,Ricky Martin,1999,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5314,"
The boy-group boom is harmless-if-bad. Martin is more like bad-if-not-worse. Since he was already marked for death with Menudo, don't be so sure his rebirth is a one-shot. But don't make him a Latin-pride poster boy either. Slicked-up rhythm workouts and romantic pap were tokens of progress circa Xavier Cugat and Desi Arnaz. In an America where Spanish is a second language, they're the reactionary strategems of one more crappy pop star.

FALSE,C,Headkeeper,Dave Mason,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7359,"
A year and a half and three abortive collaborations later--this guy is a love expert?--he's back on the market with five new studio songs and five old live ones, two from Traffic and three from Alone Together.

"
FALSE,C,It's Like You Never Left,Dave Mason,1973,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7361,"
Once again Mason, whose music has all but disappeared amid corporate machinations over the past few years, can offer new material in finished studio versions, and I bet he's genuinely happy about it. The vague romantic dolor of his songs, after all, is a professional gimmick rather than a personal commitment, and the welcome-back-folks title probably expresses his very deepest feelings. But for me it's like I was never here in the first place.

Disappointed though I am by the folky localism cum chauvinism of recent Pentangle and Fairport, Matthews's mid-Atlantic compromise is worse. Basically, he's James Taylor--without the whine, which I'd consider a real improvement if I could imagine Taylor ""interpreting"" the bitter ""Jinkson Johnson"" so bright and upbeat it sounded like Poco.

FALSE,C,Sweet Exorcist,Curtis Mayfield,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7374,"
No, Curtis has not latched onto another lucrative soundtrack. In fact, he claims to have written his exorcist song (about a female sexorcist) before there was an exorcist movie. He could have avoided this confusion by calling the album ""To Be Invisible"" after its only interesting song, from the less lucrative Claudine soundtrack, where Gladys Knight sings it better than him. Mayfield's next lp: The Great Ratsby.
"
FALSE,C,McCartney II,Paul McCartney,1980,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5427,"
Paulie's 1970 DIY sounded homemade--its unfinished musings intimated an appealingly modest freedom. This one was recorded on a sixteen-track with an engineer in attendance. The instrumentals are doodles, the songs demos by a man who scores the occasional hit only to prove he's a genius. Which he isn't.
"
FALSE,C,Thinking of Woody Guthrie,Country Joe McDonald,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11065,"
It's the concept of this album that I don't like. Musically, it's not bad--a nice selection of Woody's tunes rendered agreeably by Joe and some Nashville sidemen. As an educational project I suppose it could be called, er, worthwhile. But anyone who has read this far may consider himself educated; the real thing is easy to swallow and can be purchased at better record shops.
"
FALSE,C,Megan Music,Megan McDonough,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7391,"
A male pianist cowrote a few of these songs, presumably concentrating on the melodies, since the lyrics run the gamut from rock music to rock bands to failed love affairs, most of them with rock musicians. Maybe she should find another scene. But then maybe she couldn't be a singer-songwriter. Best line: ""But babe I get lost taking off my sweater.""

Despite the occasional Byrdsy guitar run, this is pure supersession, a purposeful AOR move by pros out for a quick killing, anonymously accomplished in the music and contentless in the lyrics. Granted, McGuinn's vocals are outstanding--look at the company he's keeping--and his ""Don't You Write Her Off"" is a genuine grabber. But it's also the simplest thing on the record. Moral: at least you can make having nothing to say sound like fun.

FALSE,C,Paris,Malcolm McLaren,1995,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5922,"
Situationism? Get real. This is the Paris of feelthy pictures, of Chirac jingles, of jazzbolism as jungle fever, of a climacteric dickhead tunelessly mimicking latter-day y������������������-y������������������ girls. It didn't sell--why in the world should it? Problem is, the old hustler is beyond sales. All he wants is loads of publicity and enough of somebody else's money to get Catherine Deneuve within range of a copped feel.

FALSE,C,The Eagle and the Poodle,Mecca Normal,1996,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5936,"
Humorless, devoid of rebop, admired by a pretentious minority of an alt-rock subculture already way too full of itself, Jean Smith is a typical avant-garde hustler, her self-promotion harmless as long as innocent bystanders don't get guilt-tripped into deciding she gives them a thrill. I prefer her poetry to her songs because it's over faster, and because I can absorb it without hearing David Lester's freeee guitar. Naive interviewer (and jerk): ""Do you listen to any music that you would consider obscure or different?"" Smith: ""I'm not really into all that record crap to tell you the truth.""
"
FALSE,C,"Melton, Levy and the Dey Brothers","Melton, Levy and the Dey Brothers",1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15527,"
Barry Melton, once the energetic young comer behind Country Joe, has done a classic Marin County cool-out. He always loved soul music, so now he makes laid-back soul music. I prefer Gamble and Huff. A sly, plaintive road song, ""Highway 1,"" wasn't written by anyone in the band, and the rest varies between pleasant and unremarkable. Melton's previous solo album was tasteless, but at least it had some passion.
"
FALSE,C,Stoner Witch,Melvins,1994,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5910,"
I know why they retain their aura of hip. It's because the drummer comes from Aberdeen and used to play in Nir . . . no no, that can't be it--oh, I remember, it's that they're pure. They're always slow, always ugly, always protodeath, always protoindustrial. And always slow. Faster here, actually, up to Sabbath speed at times, with nine minutes of din at the end to shore up their cred. If you're young and depressed and too bright or not too bright, this sound may speak to your condition, and far be it from me to suggest volunteering for Rock the Vote instead. The rest of us can read about them.
"
FALSE,C,Electric Black Man,Eric Mercury,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7422,"
All things considered--tasteless hype, demeaning concept, kudos from David Clayton-Thomas, violins-and-wah-wah production, oh, the exploitative stupidity of it all--this isn't a complete disaster, because Mercury is a fairly strong singer. Maybe some day he'll put out a fairly strong album.
"
FALSE,C,Lee Michaels,Lee Michaels,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11534,"
Michaels, a talented singer-organist from California, has been trying for years and is beginning to develop a name on sheer persistence. His previous two albums have been somewhat over produced, but solid, even though he has never proved he can do it all by himself, which is his ambition. This one was cut, as the ads tell us, in seven hours. That may be okay for the Beatles but doesn't make it here. Drummer Bartholomew Smith-Frost stretches things out with two drum breaks ad Michaels' organ is often inflated. The final track, ""Heighty Ho,"" now released in a half-length version as a single, is marvelously catchy and ebullient, but doesn't justify the rest.
"
FALSE,C,The Trials of Van Occupanther,Midlake,2007,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13598,"
The prestige of this conjunction of pomo prog, alt-country, fantasy fiction and video-game narrativity is the silliest proof yet of how jaded indie's tastebuds have become, with candied cannabis and lark's wings in aspic impending. Because Tim Smith has a sweet voice and a decent heart and his formerly psychedelic bandmates can negotiate moderately complex arrangements without twisting their ankles, this unfathomable concept album about loneliness on some olde frontier is compared to ""classic rock""--Fleetwood Mac especially. Putting that band's eponymous rhythm section aside, one wonders just which of these songs might entrance the common folk like, for instance, ""Go Your Own Way."" Perhaps the first and catchiest, in which Smith as Occupanther laments that he isn't named Roscoe. There's a sentiment all can share. Roscoe Smith. We'll have this fellow playing da blooze yet.

So she can translate Billy Joel into Phil Spector--she has nevertheless become, at least on record, just another pop singer, albeit with a few interesting idea. I ask you, is the redemption of Billy Joel fit work for a culture heroine?
"
FALSE,C,Them Changes,Buddy Miles,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=7439,"
His work on Band of Gypsies and Devotion surpasses anything he ever did with the Electric Flag, but that's due to the artistic maturity of Hendrix and McLaughlin, not of Buddy Miles. His singing is too thin to carry two consecutive cuts, his drumming has to be exploited by subtler musicians, and the title cut is the only decent song he ever wrote.
"
FALSE,C,Wide River,The Steve Miller Band,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5893,"
Anyone naive enough to believe there's nothing more distasteful than a middle-aged man pretending his hormones are too much for him has never encountered a middle-aged man trying to act cute. Not to mention a middle-aged white ""bluesman"" who compares himself to Picasso whilst suing black people who sample his hooks.

Frank Farian's great Eurodisco experiment Boney M didn't go over Stateside for the simple reason that it was too Euro. His Eurorap is hipper, sexier, even a teensy bit soulful--in short, indistinguishable from the highest quality Amerischlock give or take some snazzy sound effects. The title cut is the best cut. The remix of the title cut is the second-best cut.

As a joke about disco and a joke about heavy, Al Jourgenson's dance-industrial had some wit to it. Here the motherfucker realizes that metalheads will throw money at you long after your hip cachet has gone the way of your hard-on.

Me is Mark, Mr. Ray is Ray, rhythm section is gone. Unidentified toilers back the pleasant tracks; the unpleasant ones are all voice, bad poetry, and instrumental accompaniment. It gets worse than "". . . you could be my Venus/I'll close my eyes and hold my ears and walk up to a broken heart,"" but only rarely does it wuss out in your face like that--usually Mark's more obscure. Sure he's also bright, sensitive, and honest (probably). But so are you (probably). So go sing in the shower.

FALSE,C,Clouds,Joni Mitchell,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10865,"
Without David Crosby's production--this is basically a voice-and-acoustic record--Joni's voice sounds malnourished, which it is. Three excellent songs, but two of them, ""Both Sides Now"" and ""Chelsea Morning,"" have been done better elsewhere. (By the way, nightclub singer Gloria Loring's version of ""Chelsea Morning"" is better than Judy Collins'.) The other one is called ""Roses Blue.""

FALSE,C,Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm,Joni Mitchell,1988,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1848,"
Dreaming, fabulizing, playing the ingenue, speaking for the displaced Native American, preaching about materialism and ecocatastrophe and the engines of war (and abortion, though not so's you can tell where she stands), she's matured into a sententious liberal. Give me the Poet of the Me Decade any day. At least Joan Baez is a sententious radical.

Young Glaswegians extolled by those weary of verse-chorus-verse as ""radical,"" ""beautiful,"" and other things that would never occur to the rest of us, they mutate the forgettable mess of their debut into something altogether more deliberate and kempt-occasionally tuneful, invariably slow. Only on the oceanbound land mass where acid house was Beatlemania would anyone sit still for such earnest post-rock tripe.

FALSE,C,Tres Cosas,Juana Molina,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12471,"
With Argentina well over on the European edge of ""Latin""--which is mostly African whatever its Spanish antecedents--it's no surprise that this reformed television actress should trick up her boring strummed singer-songwritering with not terribly interesting electronica.  With the market for both modes desperate for marginal differentiation, it's also no surprise that she gets a bump for being exotic if not literally dark-skinned.  Needless to say, there are no surprises anywhere else either. That really isn't how soundscaping is supposed to work.

Subtitle: ""Music by the Doors."" Auxiliary subtitle: ""Poems, Lyrics and Stories by James Douglas Morrison."" Like every Morrison exploitation, this one is done with love--the Doors play like they've never been away. What it exploits, however, is a bad poet who got a chance to jack off with both hands when he didn't have to carry a tune. If you think lines like ""Large buxom obese queens"" or ""We need great golden copulations"" or ""To propagate our lust for life"" or ""Death and my cock are the world"" read bad, you should hear him recite them.

You can't deny these boys are pros--they know how to pace an album, hard ones and soft ones and golden oldies and rhinestone originals, and I still love their famous fat-skinny counterpoint on stage.

Tom Smucker, who should know, says the difference between the departed Brian Ahern and Tom Catalano, the producer Murray has inherited from Helen Reddy, is the difference between Revisionist Anti Schlock and Assumed Schlock. If Schlock is ""materialism in a Dionysian mode""--innocent, like Las Vegas as Tom Wolfe explains it--then Assumed Schlock ""takes consumption for granted as consumption turns into smug middle-class accumulation."" In other words, all the Canadian songwriters in the world can't overcome the extravagant dullness of these arrangements: the rock 'n' roll cut could be Giselle MacKenzie in 1956. Say it ain't so, Annie.

It's touching to watch the latest indie-rock generation flail around in search of a form, spouting sincerely all the while. But it's also depressing. Like the emo guys, Louisville's Neil-ish Jim James has the advantage of normal feelings and ambition--he's not content to remain subcultural. He claims his Dave Matthews-sponsored major-label debut was his chance to make a true band record, and I guess his boys are trickier than Crazy Horse, just not in any way you haven't heard before. Then there's his filtered drawl, his straitened tune sense, his lyrics you feel cheated straining for, his 12 songs in 72 minutes. For what? For the horrible Memphis Horns coda of ""Easy Morning Rebel,"" plodding on funklessly for two minutes after the vocal has gone the way of all reverb?

The Velvet Underground and Nico plus Chelsea Girl convinced me that Nico had charisma; The Marble Index plus Desertshore convince me that she's a fool. The difference is that now Nico writes the songs--songs with titles like ""The Falconer"" and ""Abschied,"" songs that indulge her doleful monotone instead of playing rhythms and tempos against it. Nothing new here--bohemian hangers-on always get to publish their work while the less socially adept (""charismatic"") are shafted. John Cale, with his ""spare"" arrangements, plays patron.

I don't know vy she's moaning about unved virgins and vether to betray her hate, and I don't vant to know. The Manzanera-Eno-Cale settings, which I believe is what one calls this sort of elevated sound effect, are suitably morbid and exotic. But funereal irony aside, her parlay of the Doors' ""The End"" and the Fuehrer's ""Das Lied Der Deutschens"" contextualizes both tunes more pejoratively than is intended. Nico is what happens when the bloodless wager their minds on the wisdom of the blood and the suicidal make something of their lives. If this be romanticism, give me Matthew Arnold--and gimme shelter.

I might agree that the way this record approximates what it (supposedly) criticizes is a species of profundity if what it (supposedly) criticized was schlock. As it is, the pseudo-disco makes Giorgio Moroder sound like Eno and the pseudo-sci-fi makes Isaac Asimov seem like a deep thinker. Back to the control board.

FALSE,C,Heartbreaker,Dolly Parton,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5629,"
Her singular country treble is unsuited to rock, where little-girlishness works only as an occasional novelty. As a result, the rock part of her crossover move fails, relegating her to the mawkish pop banality that tempts almost every genius country singer. This she brings off, if you like mawkish pop banality; I prefer mawkish country banality, which is sparer.

The three live sides include no new tunes and none from his first album. Many women scream, and a few sing into his hand-held mike. Both uptempo tunes on the studio side are pretty good, but they're interspersed with an exceedingly distracting interview conducted by one Mimi Brown. MB: ""How do you like your eggs?"" TP: ""Hard."" MB: ""Out of your three albums, which is your favorite?"" TP: ""I'd say my first.""

The head Journeyman's USA for Africa cameos were so discreetly intense and discreetly tossed off they made me wonder what I'd been missing. Now I know--musical gastroenteritis. Pat Boone didn't understand, so why should Steve Perry--oversinging signifies not soul and inspiration but will and desperation.

""One Slip,"" which provides the title at just the moment the singer is so ""decadent"" as to copulate with a woman, is no less sexist than the rape-fantasy cover of Roger Waters's Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking. ""The Dogs of War,"" ID'd with blues bottom, could almost be the tin soldiers of Waters-as-Floyd's The Final Cut. In short, you'd hardly know the group's conceptmaster was gone--except that they put out noticeably fewer ideas.

This is the famous Lennon/Clapton/Ono/Voorman/White (Voorman?/White?) concert. I happened to be there and it wasn't so hot live. It is worse recorded. The anti-Yoko reaction has long since passed beyond boorishness, but that doesn't mean I want to hear her keen for 20 minutes, and the rock side is raw and badly recorded, with Clapton's masterful lead obscured by Lennon's rhythm. Of value primarily as a document.

Unless ""A masterpiece without a frame"" and ""I want to fuck her on the floor/Among my books of ancient lore"" are jokes no one gets, the sole compliment one can pay this confessional poetry by a fiftysomething cocksman who Cannot Love is that at least he's willing to look like a fool. But that's been his shtick since he was bleeding himself with broken Skippy jars. Right, Ig, you're ""corrupt""--no news there. Unfortunately, blaming ""the paranoia of the age"" and bitching ""I gave em every part of me"" is also corrupt. Plus one more thing: Until you learn to sing a little better, maybe you'd better say goodbye to Medeski Martin and Wood and put in a call to the Sales brothers.

Of course he's serious; who could doubt it? Griff's problem (one of them, I mean) is that he's too serious--Chuck D. is too serious, and Chuck is Kid if not Play by comparison. What little pleasure contaminates this music is like a Stryper solo, or a folksinger who's decided a drummer might bring his or her message to the masses--aping Chuck or biting the Last Poets, Griff's a lame, and the Lads are followers. Even the list of U.S. war crimes, the strongest dumbass leftist moment in a scattershot analysis, is compromised by his praise for Khomeini and Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings. And though he adjudges the universal price code a tool of the Great Satan, he didn't have the clout or the principle to keep it off his package.

Admired by Britcrits, who can't tell whether they're ""pop"" or ""rock,"" and their record company, which pushed (and shoved) this follow-up until it went gold Stateside, they try to prove ""Creep"" wasn't a one-shot by pretending that it wasn't a joke. Not that there's anything deeply phony about Thom Yorke's angst--it's just a social given, a mindset that comes as naturally to a '90s guy as the skilled guitar noises that frame it. Thus the words achieve precisely the same pitch of aesthetic necessity as the music, which is none at all.

FALSE,C,A Better Version of Me,Rainer Maria,2000,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=10068,"
Structurally, indie-rock is as healthy as any other unsubsidized commodity in a panic economy. Clubs will fail, arty fans feel the pinch, but the infrastructure won't blow away. Musically, however, it's just limping along, especially when it declines the crutch of genre homage. Take this high-buzz Wisconsin-to-Gotham brainchild of ex-Ezra Pound guitarist William Kuehn. Compared by one admirer to ""pop bands like Versus, Verbena, and of course Superchunk"" while another cites its ""male/female vocals a la Velocity Girl (minus the pop)"" (and neither mentions Veruca Salt or V������������������rttin������������������), Rainer Maria is the genuine collegiate article: impressionistic and overwrought. Emo is a male preserve. But emo fans are woman-friendly enough to sit still for music contoured to the vocal stylings of Caithlin"

I think this is less horrible, that's all. Still the same strained, stupid lyrics with singing to match and programmed high energy to help it all go down (or past).

But can a red man sing the whites? Sorry, not this time. After all, what in Native American tradition would predispose a band toward rock and roll? Much more impressive is that Pat and Lolly Vegas wrote ""Niki Hokey,"" but except maybe for ""Witch Queen of New Orleans,"" there are no more of these here. Better you should send your five bucks to the Piutes.

Which of course she did. Item: California disc jockeys are playing Bette's version of ""Delta Dawn"" on top of Helen's and chortling.

When I heard that a bunch of Marxist-Leninists from Cambridge had made a satirical rock and roll record, I couldn't wait to hear it, but believe me, you can. Only Marxist-Leninists from Cambridge would spend so much time mocking elitist academics while their own distance from working-class experience, typified by the lack of conviction in their folk-rock, remained so palpable. Exceptions: ""Hunger,"" recommended to Harry Chapin, and ""Movement Lovers,"" which because it is about left politics qualifies as genuine socialist realism.

I read where this song cycle about two drug addicts who fall into sadie-mazie in thrillingly decadent Berlin is a . . . what was that? artistic accomplishment, even if you don't like it much. Well, the category is real enough--it describes a lot of Ornette Coleman and even some Randy Newman, not to mention a whole lot of books--but in this case it happens to be horseshit. The story is lousy--if something similar was coughed up by some avant-garde asshole like, oh, Alfred Chester (arcane reference for all you rock folk who think you're cool cos you read half of Nova Express) everyone would be too bored to puke at it. The music is only competent--even Bob Ezrin can't manufacture a distance between the washed-up characters and their washed-out creator when the creator is actually singing. Also, what is this water-boy business? Is that a Buddhist cop? Gunga Din? Will Lou lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it?

It's disheartening that people whose age and wisdom approach my own are fussing over his New Orleans ""concept""--a posse of L.A. studio hacks augmented by a few ringers and the kind of second-line once-removed horn charts the Band was hiring 20 years ago.

You can tell Kenny's pop rather than outlaw because his beard is neat. You can tell he's pop rather than country because his singles average over three minutes.

Shooting straighter than I'd expect of the Tubes or Orchestra Luna, these art-schoolers look at the Wild West and see laundromats, tourist attractions, and hand-tooled footwear. And shooting even lower than I'd hoped, they hear synth-pop with dobros and steel guitars. Commerciality--it's so campy.

He creaks, he cracks, he croaks, he clinks, yet that's not quite the point--older guys with worse voices have sung better anyway. Champion Jack Dupree, for instance, prevailed in his eighties because he never staked his manhood on the technical impeccability of his physical instrument. For decades, Sinatra's sound was magnificent--not just beautiful, meaningful. But now, though he still outclasses the likes of Bono and Carly Simon, Liza Minnelli takes him to acting school and Luther Vandross sings pretty rings around him.

Despite the presence of some good and previously unreleased songs, this is an indulgence.

Reading the lyric of ""The Boy With the Moon and Star on His Head,"" I was impressed by how unpretentiously it simulated early English poetry. But when I listened--a widely recommended method for that perception of songs--I noticed affectations like ""the naked earth beneath us and the universe above,"" and winced at the next-to-last couplet, which ends with a weak word for the sake of a weak rhyme. Then I browsed in Norman Ault's anthology of Elizabethan lyrics. Forget it, Cat.

Stills has always come on as the ultimate rich hippie--arrogant, self-pitying, sexist, shallow. Unfortunately, he's never quite fulfilled this artistic potential, but now he's approaching his true level. Flashes of brilliant ease remain--the single, ""Marianne,"" is very nice, especially if you don't listen too hard to the lyrics--but there's also a lot of stuff on order of an all-male chorus with jazzy horns singing ""It's disgusting"" in perfect tuneful unison, and straight, I swear. Keep it up, SS--it'll be a pleasure to watch you fail.

I had hopes for this record, honest. I certainly prefer the show tunes of her flowering to the ""rock"" (and schlock) of her Hollywood phase, and I enjoy discovering musical-comedy gems my normal interests would never steer me to. But unearthing gems is not Barbra's purpose. There are only three lyricists here--Ira Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein II, and the album's real reason for being, Stephen Sondheim, who sums up his aesthetic philosophy by rewriting a song about Seurat so it applies instead to that other great artiste, la Streisand. I've enjoyed all the non-Sondheim songs in less precisely wrought versions and am also familiar with a little something called ""Send in the Clowns.""

Misshapen and useless despite a not-bad hit single and a not-bad Springsteen song, it's an object lesson in record-biz malfeasance from the Horatio Alger lies of ""Livin' in America"" to the lumpish desecration of ""Lush Life,"" and Summer thanks God so often it's surprising she couldn't talk Him into joining Dyan Cannon, Kenny Loggins, Stevie Wonder, and Peggy Lipton Jones in the All Star Choir that chants this Inspirational Verse from Jon Anderson and Vangelis: ""Shablamidi, shablamida/Shablamidi/Shablamidi, shablamida.""

As egotists go, Taylor is a talent--a gifted guitarist, a better-than-average melodist, a pithy lyricist whose feeling for Americanese is warm if corny. And his voice you can get used to--it's soulful in its way, and he can phrase. But melodies aside, he's not a star for his virtues. He's a star because he's an egotist--because he vaunts his sensitivity so expertly. So it's inevitable that this best-of should shortchange his sense of humor (""Gorilla,"" ""Chili Dog,"" ""Money Machine"") and horror (""Knocking 'Round the Zoo,"" ""Junkie's Lament"") and preserve his disgraceful covers of ""You've Got a Friend"" and ""How Sweet It Is.""

Their worst-ever studio LP doesn't deserve to be called slick. It's professional and expensive, yes, but it's also a mess--oversung, overarranged, overpackaged.

It's easy out there for an Oscar winner, but you'd never know it from these entertainment moguls, who pretend or report that they're still investing in mayhem, misogyny and sales careers whose main drawback is that they can get you arrested. Case in point: Dat Dumbass Project Pat, who with three years in the pen behind him adds extra soupcons of brutality just in case Hollywood has turned Juicy J soft. Watch out, little brother.

Blame Canada, which gulls citizens into subsidizing local culture with the lure of universal health care. Fifteen years on, that northern nation's favorite rock band--led by deep thinker Gordon Downie, who ungratefully notes, ""If I do believe in a country, it's the country of me""--has progressed from a passable ""blues-based"" literacy (imbued, of course, with the natural sense of rhythm for which Canadians are renowned) to candidly ornate and obscure art-rock. ""Why haven't The Hip sold millions in the States?"" demands one loyal fan. His first hypothesis: ""Lyrics don't translate into ebonics.""

Elevated by the Rolling Stones into mythic status among white people, the Turners are now haunted by their profligate recording habits--Capitol is the tenth label to release an I&amp;TT LP in the past two years. Granted, most and maybe all of them are better than this, a humdrum blues runthrough (with big-band horns and fake-symph strings) on which Ike claims authorship of such works as ""Dust My Broom"" (here yclept ""I Believe"") and ""Ten Long Years"" (here yclept ""Five Long Years"").

The ACLU may not want it advertised, but this record is pornographic; that's one of the few good things about it. Hooked by two Hispanic/Asian working girls uttering rhythmic fuckwords, the number-one rap single ""Me So Horny"" packs the gross eroticism of a good hard-core loop. Romance isn't an issue; liking women isn't even an issue. Thus there are few distracting rationalizations about how this or that bitch did them wrong--these Miami knuckleheads are just normal red-blooded American misogynists. They like it ""rough and painful""; they tell men how to ""give her more than she wants""; they never touch a woman anywhere but between her legs. And only rarely do their raw samples generate the heat of the single. So in the long run, they're almost as unlikely to inspire good sex as a sermon by Donald Wildmon. They don't belong in jail.

It would be wrong to call such passages drones, because drones propel, and propulsion would be catering to the hoi polloi--""patterns"" is quite kind enough.

There's San Francisco's gold-certified Third Eye Blind, whose little sex kinks are too catchy to get het up about. There's Orlando's double-platinum Matchbox 20, whose breakthrough hit some mistakenly (as is always claimed) believe promotes spousal abuse. But the one I really can't stand is this near-pseudoalternative one, grown men from Michigan who released two indie albums before their major-label debut catapulted to platinum on a soggy prowoman morality tale aimed at frat rats, who are urged not to drive girls to suicide by dumping them.

Tommy's operatic pretensions were so transparent that for years it seemed safe to guess that Townshend's musical ideas would never catch up with his lyrics. And it fact they didn't--both became more prolix at about the same rate. This isn't so grotesque as All the Blind Chinamen Have Western Eyes, but between the synths and the book-club poetry it's the nearest thing to classic awful English art-rock since Genesis discovered funk. Best tune: ""Eminence Front,"" on which Townshend discovers funk. Just in time. Bye.

FALSE,C,Endless Wire,The Who,2006,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=13431,"
The album is unlistenable for a simple reason: Roger Daltrey. Now 62, he's incapable in body as well as mind of negotiating the first new Who material since 1982's dreadful It's Hard. Gesturing futilely toward high notes as he tries to remember his acting lessons, he croaks, growls, shouts, emotes and otherwise bollockses songs he's sure are profound. When the leader spells him seven tracks in, the sharp uptick in modesty and lyricism comes as a relief until the ""Wake up and hear the music"" jag at the end. But it's the leader who decided prog was a peachy idea, the leader who designates yet another song cycle a ""mini-opera,"" the leader who gives the orders around here. So the album is also unlistenable for a complicated reason: Pete Townshend.

FALSE,C,Wild Cherry,Wild Cherry,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8120,"
This is regarded by the pure of heart as a racist vulgarization, but although I'll go along with the argument that the hook on ""Play That Funky Music"" isn't the rhythmic track but the words ""white boy,"" I insist that it's real hard to vulgarize Graham Central Station. Sure the performance is a bit on the crude side, but the relationship is more that of Grand Funk to Cream than of, say, Jim Dandy Mangrum to Sly Stone.
"
FALSE,C,Family Tradition,Hank Williams Jr.,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8124,"
Since ""To Love Somebody"" isn't exactly Hank's kind of song, I guess he disavowed the Ray Ruff-produced side of this. On the other hand, ""Family Tradition"" (guess who that's about) leads off the other side, and it is exactly Hank's kind of song. Exactly. That's not so great either.
"
FALSE,C,Montana Cafe,Hank Williams Jr.,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8629,"
Having survived his brush with death, his defection to rock, and his obsession with his daddy, whom he now outsells, Williams rests on his laurels as professional braggart and secondhand showbiz legend. He's one of the few country artists who goes gold at least partly because he's not really country--like rock both '50s and post-Allmans, country's just grist for a macho vaudeville that on this album blows even harder than usual. The tip-off's ""Bocephus,"" a return to unabashed me-me-me. But let us now overlook the ill-rhymed polka about cowboy hats, the Leon Redbone-styled ""Harvest Moon,"" and the novelty rag about pretty girls whose ""pig"" friends interfere with the workings of Junior's dick.

FALSE,C,Blue Rider,Cris Williamson,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8631,"
Proving that lesbians are normal folks with normal hopes, normal regrets, even normal string arrangements--just like you, me, and Nicolette Larson. Next question.
"
FALSE,C,Journey Home,Will to Power,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8729,"
Auteur-fuehrer-rapper Bob Rosenberg's unprecedented meld of disco cheese and heavy pop-rock proves yet again that originality and fatuity aren't mutually exclusive--especially if you don't take originality too far. Of the 10 songs here, Rosenberg wrote eight. These do not include (10cc's) ""I'm Not in Love,"" the highly belated follow-up to his 1988 Skynyrd-Frampton medley, nor ""Boogie Nights,"" to which he adds the moving if redundant confession, ""It took some remakes to get your attention."" They do, however, include the six-minute spoken-word-cheesy-pop-heavy-disco-rock ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" a political manifesto as daring and thoughtful as anything dreamed by Jello Bangladesh or Minions of Dull Chords. Quoting Jefferson, Whitman, Emerson, Wilde, his man Nietzsche, Solzhenitsyn, and the National Rifle Association, Rosenberg declares free speech useless and sweet reason all, while coming out in favor of animal rights, the Second Amendment, and robbing the rich--an exemplary melange of the one-stop individualism that's long passed for politics in every wing of the rock counterculture. Words to live by: ""Death before dishonor, as it were.""

FALSE,C,Imagination,Brian Wilson,1998,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=461,"
Wilson's genius has never been as indelible or universal as worshipers believe. Generating illusions of eternal sunlight or crafting frames for crackpot solipsism, he was magical; stripped by Don Was or cambered by Van Dyke Parks, he was at least interesting. Submitting to adult-contempo tycoon Joe Thomas, however, he's just what you'd fear: a middle-aged pop pro who's proud he's no longer nuts and knows even less about the world than when he was. The lead cut has a happy tune, the dark finale some dysfunctional intimations. In between, he makes too much of attendant hacks and gestures at old glories from a failing high end.

FALSE,C,Wilson Phillips,Wilson Phillips,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5851,"
Genealogically, Chynna's group--the elaborately arranged professional folk-rock of her mama and papa, rather than the obsessively reworked private surf-rock of Carnie and Wendy's boyish dad, are where their (and the world's) polished pop comes from, and their fashion sense is Laurel Canyon a land-grab later. Finicky and well-manicured though it is, it's not without its intricately minor pleasures, notably on compositions untouched by the singers' hands--""Impulsive,"" or (Gunnar and Matthew, why didn't you think of this?) ""Eyes Like Twins."" The '60s myth ""The Dream Is Still Alive"" they claim as their own.
"
FALSE,C,Back to the Egg,Wings,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8140,"
Whew. Sixteen titles on an untimed LP that must run forty minutes if not fifty--or seventy-five. When he's on, Paulie's abundant tunefulness passes for generosity. Here he's just hoping something will stick.
"
FALSE,C,Entrance,Edgar Winter,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8141,"
Better you should graft bebop harmonies and solos onto a rock (or even artrock) trunk for your jazz fusion than arrange rock and not-so-rock songs for a Stan-Kenton-goes-to-Nevada bouquet. If only Edgar didn't try and conceal his mild-mannered vocal tendencies behind that shriek. And if only he scatted and soloed like a brother.
"
FALSE,C,Edgar Winter's White Trash,Edgar Winter,1971,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8142,"
So this is that hardass roadhouse rockaroll, eh? Sounds like overkill to me, which I guess is very Texas, but I figured in Texas they'd be too real to mistake hysteria for a good time. And since when do they rhyme ""subjective"" and ""objective"" down there? Or wonder whether the world will be saved by Mr. White or Mr. Black?
"
FALSE,C,Talking Back to the Night,Steve Winwood,1982,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8640,"
Launched on a chart-certified comeback, he tries to consolidate his gains by writing songs instead of tripping over them the way he did with ""While You See a Chance."" Somebody throw a synthesizer at that man's ankles.
"
FALSE,C,Back in the High Life,Steve Winwood,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8641,"
This is the fate of a wunderkind with more talent than brains: after two decades of special treatment, he derives all the self-esteem he needs just from surviving, as they say. So he's confident that the veracity and unpretentiousness of his well-wrought banalities make them interesting, when in fact they're exactly as interesting as he is.
"
FALSE,C,'Bout Love,Bill Withers,1978,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8159,"
In which Bill acquires a melodist (Paul Smith) and a theme (see title). He should dump 'em both. And if he's in some sort of group therapy, he should dump that too.
"
FALSE,C,On the Road Again,Roy Wood,1979,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=3044,"
I once thought it spoke well of Annie Haslam and all her renascent octaves that they'd kept this gifted recluse interested for so many years. But on the evidence of these would-be Move outtakes--and the would-be Boulders outtakes of 1976's Mustard--I gather that it doesn't take much to divert the fellow.
"
FALSE,C,Private Revolution,World Party,1986,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8654,"
As a sourpuss who counsels self-improvement and jots down the occasional specific, Karl Wallinger is several steps up the evolutionary ladder from Howard Jones. But it's no less fatalistic to say humanity is defined by original sin than to say the world is good because God made it. Jones believes that war is over if you think it is, Wallinger that war is over if each and every one of you think it is; both prefer attitude to action, especially collective action. And if that's rock and roll, as I sometimes fear, it doesn't happen to be good rock and roll.
"
FALSE,C,The Dream Weaver,Gary Wright,1975,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8174,"
Supposedly, the artistic breakthrough here is that Gary has transcended the electric guitar. Some breakthrough--good thing Lee Michaels never took up with a synthesizer. Although if he had he wouldn't have pimped it off to (and I quote) ""the astral plane.""
"
FALSE,C,"To the East, Blackwards",X-Clan,1990,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4221,"
As message rap achieves the glut of gangster rap, party rap, and crossover rap, prophets and demagogues of every description join the myriad of hip hop wannabees, enabling lugs like these avowedly non-""humanist"" Brooklynites to make their subcultural dent. Hallmarks: obscure Egyptological insults and flowing funk beats. Keywords: ""vanglorious,"" which is vainglorious, and ""sissy,"" a cross between the deep euphemism of ""sucker"" and the shameless bigotry of ""faggot."" Osiris is getting sick of this shit.
"
FALSE,C,Fabulous Muscles,Xiu Xiu,2004,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=12603,"
The musical parsimony, cultural insularity, moral certitude, and histrionic affectations of these lo-fi artier-than-thous promise indie ideologues whole lifetimes of egoistic irrelevance. ""Why should I care if you get killed?"" Jamie Stewart asks a ""stupid"" ""jock"" Iraq G.I. he makes sure remains out of earshot. He gets closer to the title sex object: ""Cremate me after you come on my lips honey boy."" But somehow one doubts things will end so exquisitely.
"
FALSE,C,Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha,Xscape,1993,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4222,"
En Vogue? Mary J. Blige? Phooey--they're not even TLC, much less Kris Kross. Their hit weak, their album a guaranteed cutout, they're worthy of note only because they may convince Jermaine Dupri he can repeat ""Jump"" whenever he wants. Don't encourage this antisocial delusion.
"
FALSE,C,Time and a Word,Yes,1970,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8183,"
I delayed judgment on the weedy harmonies and genteel virtuosity of their debut, mostly because they covered the Byrds and the Beatles, who flirted with weeds and gentility themselves. This time they cover Richie Havens, synopsize Kahlil Gibran, and insert orchestrations that cry out of the fine hand of Dmitri Tiomkin. Answer to title quiz: ""now"" and ""love.""
"
FALSE,C,Tales from Topographic Oceans,Yes,1974,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4241,"
Nice ""passages"" here, as they say, but what flatulent quasisymphonies--the whole is definitely less than the sum of its parts, and some of the parts are pretty negligible. I mean, howcum they didn't choose to echo Graeco-Roman, Hebrew, and African culture as well as the lost Indian, Chinese, Central American, and Atlantean ones? Typical hyperromantic exoticism is one answer, and everybody would know they're full of shit is the other.
"
FALSE,C,Going for the One,Yes,1977,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8184,"
The title track may be their best ever, challenging a formula that even apologists are apologizing for by now with cutting hard rock guitar and lyrics in which Jon Anderson casts aspersions upon his own ""cosmic mind."" But even there you wish you could erase Rick Wakeman, who sticks strictly to organ pomp and ident noodles throughout, and elsewhere Steve Howe has almost as little to say.
"
FALSE,C,Hot Rats,Frank Zappa,1969,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=11057,"
Doo-doo to you, Frank--when I want movie music I'll listen to ""Wonderwall.""

If this be social ""satire,"" how come its sole targets are ordinary citizens whose weirdnesses happen to diverge from those of the retentive gent at the control board? Or are we to read his new fixation on buggery as an indication of approval? Makes you wonder whether his primo guitar solo on ""Yo' Mama"" and those as-unique-as-they-used-to-be rhythms and textures are as arid spiritually as he is. As if there were any question after all these years.

FALSE,C,Rio Grande Mud,ZZ Top,1972,https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8202,"
Significant that the only memorable song by (or from, rather) this no-organ Allmanesque trio--""Francene,"" a small but deserving hit--was not written by the principals. Let's just hope it isn't very significant.
